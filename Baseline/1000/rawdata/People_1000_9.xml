''Ojibwa Texts'', vol. ii. Truman Michelson, ed. Leyden, New York: G. E. Stechert &amp; co., pp. 380-393&lt;/ref&gt; is a character found in the ''[[Aadizookaan]]'' of the [[Anishinaabe]] peoples.  Similar in nature to the [[Ojibwa]] [[Nanabozho]] stories, the Aayaash stories tell of his trials and tribulations, with each story carrying a moral.

'''Bezerenbam''' (or '''Bazaram-bam''') and '''Mişelav''' were the [[Wallachia]]n (Romanian) leaders&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 552"&gt;Xenopol, p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Djuvara, cited article"&gt;Djuvara, cited article.&lt;/ref&gt; (the former a "[[Ban (title)|ban]]" according to Xenopol, Hasdeu and Constantin C. Giurescu) mentioned in 1241, in the Persian chronicle [[Jami' al-tawarikh|Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh]] written by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (Fazel-Ullah-Raschid). They appear in the context of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]. The former's army was located in ''Ilaut country'', as the chronicle says:

:''In the middle of the spring (1240), the princes crossed the (...) mountains to enter in the country of Bulars and Bashguirds. Orda, who marched on the right, passing through Ilaut country, met (Bezerenbam?) with an army; the latter has been defeated. Cardan and Buri went against the Sassans,&lt;ref&gt;"They were probably the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] who were living in the Eastern provinces of Hungary, and were attacked by prince Cardan." (author's note)&lt;/ref&gt; and  defeated them after three battles. Budjek crossed the mountains of that country in order to enter in Cara-Ulag (probably [[Transylvania]] and [[Wallachia]]), defeated the Ulags ([[Vlachs]]), crossed the (...) mountains, and entered in the country of (Mişelav?), where he beat the awaiting enemy.''.&lt;ref&gt;[[d'Ohsson]] p. 627 - 628.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, ''History of the Romanians'', [[Alexandru D. Xenopol]] considers that it is possible for Bezerenbam, or Basarab the [[Ban (title)|ban]],&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; to be the same person as [[Litovoi]], mentioned in a document from 1247 as ruler of the same [[Oltenia|land]].&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 552"/&gt; He considers Bazaram-bam is an ancestor of the Romanian dynasty of Basarab &lt;ref&gt;Les Roumains au moyen-age: une énigme historique By Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol, Publisher: Paris, E. Leroux, 1885 OCLC Number:	4153032&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] also thinks that the leader was "Basarab the [[Ban (title)|ban]]", a local leader, while [[Constantin C. Giurescu]] considers that this name was a distorted form of the title of [[Banat of Severin|Ban of Severin]] (Terra Zeurino).&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neagu Djuvara]] has considered the possibility that Mişelav was [[Seneslau]],&lt;ref name="Djuvara, cited article"/&gt; another Wallachian leader contemporary with and neighbouring Litovoi.

The term '''Cairo 52''' refers to the fifty-two men who were arrested on May 11, 2001, aboard a floating [[gay nightclub]] called the '''Queen Boat''', which was moored on the [[Nile]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="dalacoura1295"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalacoura|first1=Katerina|title=Homosexuality as cultural battleground in the Middle East: culture and postcolonial international theory|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=2014|volume=35|issue=7|pages=1295–1296|doi=10.1080/01436597.2014.926119}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ashraf.jpg|thumb|280px|Ashraf Zanati, one of the Cairo 52, who later fled to [[Vancouver, BC]], [[Canada]].]] --&gt;

==Charges==
Of fifty-two men arrested, fifty were charged with "habitual debauchery" and "obscene behaviour" under Article 9c of Law No. 10 of 1961 on the Combat of [[Prostitution]].  Another two were charged with "contempt of religion" under Article 98f of the Penal Code. All fifty-two men pleaded [[innocent]]. 
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Cairo 52.jpg|thumb|280px|left|The Cairo 52 in detention.]] --&gt;

==Treatment of Arrest==
According to the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]] (IGLHRC), the men were subjected to beatings and [[forensic]] examinations to "prove their homosexuality".  All 52 men were kept for twenty-two hours a day in two cramped cells with no beds.

==Trials==
[[Image:QueenBoat.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Queen Boat]]
The trials of the "Cairo 52" lasted five months and the defendants were vilified in the Egyptian [[News media|media]], which printed their real names and addresses, and branded them as agents against the State. The trials were condemned by international [[human rights]] organizations, members of [[US Congress]] and the [[United Nations]]. Lawyers for the defense argued that the cases should be dismissed on the grounds of [[false arrest]], improper arrest procedures, falsified evidence and police intimidation. During the trial, homosexuality was characterized as "un-Egyptian".&lt;ref name="dalacoura1295"/&gt;

On November 14, 2001, twenty-one of the men were convicted of the "habitual practice of debauchery," one man of "contempt for religion," and another, accused of being the "ringleader," was convicted of both charges and received the heaviest sentence, five years' [[penal labour|hard labour]].  A fifty-third man, a teenager, was tried in juvenile court and was sentenced to the maximum penalty of three years in prison, to be followed by three years of probation.

In May 2002, those convicted were released pending a second trial; both the guilty and not-guilty verdicts were overturned, provoking international outrage.  In July 2002, fifty of the men began a second trial (the other two men had been convicted of contempt for religion, and their sentences were upheld).  This trial, held at Qasr-al-Nil Misdemeanors Court in Cairo and presided over by Judge Abdel Karim, the same judge who had presided over the first trial, lasted only fifteen minutes, ending when Karim [[recusal|recused]] himself.  The trial was then moved to September.  The retrial ended in March, 2003.  Twenty-one men were handed three-year jail sentences and twenty-nine were acquitted.

==Cairo 52 in the media==
The Cairo 52 were featured in a documentary by After Stonewall Productions, narrated by [[Janeane Garofalo]], entitled ''[[Dangerous Living: Coming Out in the Developing World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080214183007/http://www.afterstonewall.com/press.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The plot of [[Maher Sabry]]'s unapologetic film ''[[All My Life (2008 film)|Toul Omry]]'' (''All My Life'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334617/#]&lt;/ref&gt;  details the lives of gay men in Egypt against the backdrop of the Cairo 52 and the notorious Queen Boat arrests. One of the characters in the film "Kareem" is almost arrested in the police raid on the floating discothèque. The news of the arrests and the follow-up in the media and newspapers is discussed by the characters throughout the film. One of the Cairo 52 men is featured in [[Parvez Sharma]]'s documentary ''[[A Jihad for Love]]'' (2008).

The word '''character sketch''' means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.

The first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style.   As Pat Rogers notes, [[Henry Fielding]], in book I, chapter 14 of ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'', invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: "Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture." Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.

In later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical.  Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of "Big John" or "the country rube" or "the wise Squire").  Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.

Today, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.

&lt;!--[[Image:Cipitio.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Cipitio is the most popular character of Salvadoran mythology.]]--&gt;

'''Cipitio''' is a legendary character found in [[El Salvador|salvadoran]] folklore revolving around the [[Siguanaba]] and [[Cadejo]] legends.  He is generally portrayed as an  8- to 10-year-old boy with a big conical wizard hat.  His name is taken from the [[Nahuatl]] word for child: "Cipit" or "Cipote". Some also relate his name to the deity [[Xipe Totec]].

According to the legend, he is the son of a forbidden romance between an indigenous Mesoamerican queen called Sihuehuet or Ziguet, now commonly known as La [[Siguanaba]], and "Lucero de la mañana" (Lúcifer Morningstar). Cipitio is the child of this affair.  When Ziguet's husband found out about this affair he sought the assistance of the very powerful god [[Teotl]]. Ziguet and ''Cipitio'' were cursed and condemned by [[Teotl]].  Cipitio was going to live forever as a small boy with his feet in backwards position, as a reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents.  Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy, but eventually get lost following them because, not knowing that '''Cipitio''' has his feet backwards, they follow them in the wrong direction.&lt;ref&gt;Kampwirth and Gonzalez 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cipitio''' is represented as liking to eat ashes,&lt;ref&gt;Kephart.&lt;/ref&gt; throwing pebbles to beautiful ladies,&lt;ref&gt;Cordova 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and likes to eat a variety of [[banana]] called "Guineo Majoncho". He could also "[[Teleportation|Teleport]]" anywhere he wants.

A couple of short stories with this character can be found in the book ''Cuentos de Cipotes'' by the Salvadoran writer and poet Salvador [[Salarrué]].

In a TV show for the Salvadoran Educational Television Station he is portrayed by Rolando Meléndez, who has played the role for several seasons. Each episode features the problems that Salvadoran children find in their communities, families and schools, Cipitio helps them while teaching morals and values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8367">A '''clerihew''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɛr|ᵻ|h|j|uː}}) is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced.  The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Christopher Wren]]
Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
If anyone calls
Say I am designing St. Paul's."&lt;ref name=bentley&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|year=1905|title=Biography for Beginners|isbn=978-1-4437-5315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Form==
A clerihew has the following properties:
* It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it mostly pokes fun at famous people
* It has four lines of irregular length and metre for comic effect
* The rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme, including the use of phrases in Latin, French and other non-English languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verse.org.uk/what-is-a-clerihew.html What is a Clerihew?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name.  According to a letter in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in the 1960s, Bentley said that a true clerihew has to have the name "at the end of the first line", as the whole point was the skill in rhyming awkward names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=William|title=The Fireside Book of Humorous Poetry|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|page=xiv|chapter=Introduction|date=1965}} Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (not unlike the schoolboy style of ''[[1066 and All That]]'').

==Practitioners==
The form was invented by and is named after [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London, the lines of his first clerihew, about [[Humphry Davy]], came into his head during a science class.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;{{cite book|last=Gale|first=Steven H.|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese|page=139|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-8240-5990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples.&lt;ref name=First&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|title=The First Clerihews|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-212980-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word in print was in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley published three volumes of his own clerihews: ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), published as "edited by E. Clerihew";&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; ''More Biography'' (1929); and ''Baseless Biography'' (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustrated by the author's son [[Nicolas Bentley]].

[[G. K. Chesterton]], a friend of Bentley, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated ''Biography for Beginners''.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including [[W. H. Auden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The All-sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry Since 1900|page=94|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-929928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

There has been newfound popularity of the form on [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Clerihew&amp;src=tyah Twitter].

==Examples==
Bentley's first clerihew, published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Humphry Davy]]
Abominated gravy.
He lived in the odium
Of having discovered [[sodium]].&lt;ref name=First/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The original poem had the second line "Was not fond of gravy";&lt;ref name=First/&gt; but the published version has "Abominated gravy".

Other clerihews by Bentley include:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[George III of the United Kingdom|George the Third]]
Ought never to have occurred.
One can only wonder
At so grotesque a blunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Morton S. (ed.)|year=1997|title=A New Dictionary of Eponyms|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-509354-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
and
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]],
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography for Beginners''. {{cite book|last=Swainson|first=Bill (ed.)|year=2000|title=Encarta Book of Quotations|pages=642–43|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-23000-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

W. H. Auden's ''[[Academic Graffiti]]'' (1971) includes:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Henry Rider Haggard]]
Was completely staggered
When his bride-to-be
Announced, "I am [[She (novel)|She]]!"&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' noted Auden's work and responded:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;W. H. Auden
Suffers from acute boredom
But for his readers he's got some merry news
He's written a collection of rather bad clerihews&lt;/poem&gt;}}
A second stanza aimed a jibe at Auden's publisher, [[Faber and Faber]].

Alan Turing, one of the founders of computing, was the subject of a clerihew written by the pupils of his ''alma mater'', [[Sherborne School]] in England:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Turing]]
Must have been alluring
To get made a don
So early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodges|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Hodges|year=1983|title=[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]|page=94|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-671-52809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

A clerihew appreciated by chemists is cited in ''Dark Sun'' by [[Richard Rhodes]], and regards the inventor of the thermos bottle (or [[Dewar flask]]): 
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Sir James Dewar]]
Is a better man than you are
None of you asses
Can liquefy gases.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

''Dark Sun'' also features a clerihew about the German-British physicist and [[Soviet]] nuclear spy [[Klaus Fuchs]]:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Klaus Fuchs|Fuchs]]
Looks 
Like an ascetic
Theoretic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32509950 |title=Dark Sun : The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb |last=Rhodes |first=Richard, |date=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=068480400X |location=New York |pages=57, 488}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In 1983, ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' magazine ran a contest titled "Do You Clerihew?" The winning entry was:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Did [[Descartes]]
Depart
With the thought
"[[Cogito ergo sum|Therefore I'm not]]"?&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Other uses of the form==
The clerihew form has also occasionally been used for non-biographical verses. Bentley opened his 1905 ''Biography for Beginners'' with an example, entitled "Introductory Remarks", on the theme of biography itself:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The Art of Biography
Is different from Geography.
Geography is about Maps,
But Biography is about Chaps.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The third edition of the same work, published in 1925, included a "Preface to the New Edition" in 11 [[stanza]]s, each in clerihew form. One stanza ran:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;On biographic style
(Formerly so vile)
The book has had an effect
Greater than I could reasonably expect.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The '''coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges riksvapen}}) has a lesser and a greater version.

== Regulated usage ==
The usage of the coats of arms is regulated by Swedish Law, [[Swedish Code of Statutes|Act]] [http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/19700498.HTM 1970:498], which states (in unofficial translation) that "in commercial activities, the coats of arms, the flag or other official insignia of Sweden may not be used in a trademark or other insignias for products or services without proper authorisation. This includes any mark or text referring to the Swedish State which this can give the commercial mark a sign of official endorsement. This includes municipal coats of arms which are registered."

Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one are considered to be the lesser coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by law 1970:498.

==Variants==
The arms of Sweden were first formally codified by law in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/rikskal/1909/0002.html|title=i (Svensk rikskalender / 1909)|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law also formally codifies the differences between the "greater" and "lesser" arms. The present law prescribing the two arms dates from 1982.

===Greater version===
The greater coat of arms is blazoned in Swedish law as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A shield [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], quartered by a cross [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] with outbent arms, and an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House. In the first and fourth fields three [[Crown (heraldry)|open crowns]] Or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams [[argent]], a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] crowned with an open crown Or armed [[gules]]. The inescutcheon is [[Division of the field|party per pale]] the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] (Bendwise azure, argent and gules, a ''vasa'' Or); and the [[House of Bernadotte]] (Azure, issuant from a wavy base a bridge with three arches and two towers embattled argent, in honor point an eagle regardant with wings inverted resting on thunderbolts Or, and in chief the Big Dipper constellation of the same). The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. [[Supporters|Supported]] by two lions regardant, crowned and with forked tails Or armed gules, standing on a [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] Or. All surrounded by [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] mantling, crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseladorned strings Or.''&lt;ref&gt;Original text of Swedish statute 1982:268, 2 §, states: ''Stora riksvapnet utgörs av en blå huvudsköld, kvadrerad genom ett kors av guld med utböjda armar, samt en hjärtsköld som innehåller det kungliga husets dynastivapen. Huvudsköldens första och fjärde fält innehåller tre öppna kronor av guld, ordnade två över en. Huvudsköldens andra och tredje fält innehåller tre ginbalksvis gående strömmar av silver, överlagda med ett upprest, med öppen krona krönt lejon av guld med röd tunga samt röda tänder och klor. Hjärtskölden är kluven. Första fältet innehåller Vasaättens vapen: ett i blått, silver och rött styckat fält, belagt med en vase av guld. Andra fältet innehåller ätten Bernadottes vapen: i blått fält en ur vatten uppskjutande bro med tre valv och två krenelerade torn, allt av silver, däröver en örn av guld med vänstervänt huvud och sänkta vingar gripande om en åskvigg av guld samt överst Karlavagnens stjärnbild av guld. Huvudskölden är krönt med en kunglig krona och omges av Serafimer ordens insignier. Sköldhållare är två tillbakaseende, med kunglig krona krönta lejon med kluvna svansar samt röda tungor, tänder och klor. Lejonen står på ett postament av guld. Det hela omges av en med kunglig krona krönt hermelinsfodrad vapenmantel av purpur med frans av guld och uppknuten med tofsprydda snören av guld. Stora riksvapnet får brukas även utan ordensinsignier, sköldhållare, postament eller vapenmantel.''

The greater arms may also be displayed only with the crowned escutcheon. While the arms have undergone significant changes over the years, such as changing the inescutcheon with the ruling dynasty, they are based on arms created by King [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson]] in 1448.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] used in the greater blazon has in total five elements: 4 [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] on the main escutcheon (two coats of arms duplicated), and three coat of arms incorporated into an escutcheon of pretense. However, Bernadotte never used any stars in the arms of Pontecorvo (neither as Prince of Pontecorvo, nor as King of Sweden and Norway). The stars were introduced as an element in the royal coat of arms in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berghman |first=Arvid |title=Dynastien Bernadottes vapen och det svenska riksvapnet |series=Skrifter / utgivna av Riksheraldikerämbetet, 99-2298099-1 ; 1 |year=1944 |publisher=Svensk litteratur |location=Stockholm |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; chosen as a symbol of Sweden's eternal existence, as in the poem by [[Esaias Tegnér]]:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;As long as [[Charles's Wain]] still turns,
Its golden wheels around the Northern zone,
As long as the land still produces iron and heroes,
Intact shall stand the ancient Swedish throne.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This symbol became especially popular through its allusion to the name that had been borne by so many famous Swedish kings. [[Ursa Major]], or as it is called in Swedish, ''Karlavagnen'' (Charles' Wain), adds a Swedish accent to the Bernadotte dynastic coat of arms much in the same way as do the Vasa arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/early_history_of_heraldry/the_three_crowns_of_sweden.htm|title=The Heraldry Society|website=Theheraldrysociety.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Personal command-sign of the King of Sweden.svg|thumb|left|The personal command sign, for military use, of the King is a rendition of the emblazonment of the greater arms. Introduced by royal regulation in 1943, it has only been created once.]]

The arms are supported by two lions with forked tails (''queue fourchée''), facing away from the shield and crowned with Royal Crowns. For centuries, the lion has been an important element in Swedish heraldry and especially for the State Coat of Arms. The shield may be surmounted by the Collar of the [[Order of Seraphim]], the foremost order in Sweden, and the highest honour the Swedish state can bestow on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;See sections 2 and 3, Lag No. 268 om Sveriges Riksvapen of April 29, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the official national coat of arms, the greater coat of arms is also the personal coat of arms of the king, and as such he can decree its use as a personal coat of arms by other members of the [[House of Bernadotte|Royal House]], with the alterations and additions decided by him.

[[Blazon]]: "The greater state arms consist of a head shield azure, quartered by a cross or with outbent arms, and an [[inescutcheon]] containing the dynastic arms of the Royal House.

In the first and fourth fields three coronets or, placed two above one. In the second and third fields three sinisterbendwise streams argent, a lion crowned with an open crown or with armaments gules. The inescutcheon is party per pale the arms for the [[House of Vasa]] and the [[House of Bernadotte]]. The main shield is crowned by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]. Supported by two lions regardant or crowned, with parted tails and armaments gules, standing on a postament. All surrounded by hermine mantling crowned with a royal crown and tied up with tasseled strings or."

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms is mainly used by the [[Government of Sweden]] and subordinate government authorities. As such it may be joined by insignias symbolising the activity of individual government agencies, following approval by the State Board of Heraldry. It is, for instance, embroidered on all [[Swedish police]] uniforms and in various coats of arms of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Blazon: "Azure, with three coronets Or, ordered two above one." Crowned with a royal crown. The shield may also be surrounded by the insignias of the [[Order of the Seraphim]]."

A '''deed of change of name''' is a legal document—used in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some other countries with [[legal system]]s based on English [[common law]]—for an official [[name change]] by a person or family. It is one use of a [[deed poll]].

Some organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without documentation, such as a deed or [[statutory declaration]]. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview&lt;/ref&gt; according to common law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/604/note/made&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal procedure==
===United Kingdom===
In [[England and Wales]], such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]]. Deeds so registered are advertised in the ''[[London Gazette]]''. A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Senior Master]] on behalf of the [[Master of the Rolls]] who will take into account the child's [[best interests]]. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change a child’s name|url=https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/change-a-childs-name|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=31 January 2015|quote=To change the name of a child aged under 16 (sometimes called a ‘minor’) you’ll need either: the agreement of everyone with parental responsibility [or] a court order}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the child does not object to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration of deeds is regulated by the ''Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994'', [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] 1994/604&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/cy/uksi/1994/604/made/data.htm?wrap=true |title=Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 |publisher=HM Government|website=legislation.data.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as amended&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/enrolling/enrolment-regulations/1994 Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 SI 1994/604 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;)
. Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.

Registration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a [[witness]], carries sufficient legal [[authority]] to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.

The procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in [[Northern Ireland]] are similar to those in England and Wales.
In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/614120/Guidance_Booklet_March_2017__ILB_44_03.17_.pdf |title=Applying for a Passport |publisher=HM Passport Office |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office.  However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614150953/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |title=Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a deed poll of change of name ({{lang-ga|Athrú Ainm de réir Gníomhais Aonpháirtí}}) is obtainable from the Central Office of the [[Four Courts]], Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician [[Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus|Seán Loftus]], who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.

==History==
In ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'' [1946] Ch 183,&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Re-Parrott-Cox-v-Parrott-1946-Ch-183 ''Re'' Parrott, Cox ''v'' Parrott &lt;nowiki&gt;[1946]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ch 183]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Vaisey|Mr Justice Vaisey]] stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's [[Christian name]] (first name) &amp;ndash; that could be done by only an [[Act of Parliament]]. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed "Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'', the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed".

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, as depicted by [[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470]]
A '''dragonslayer''' is a person or being that slays [[dragon]]s. Dragonslayers and the creatures they hunt have been popular in traditional stories from around the world: they are a type of story classified as type 300 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]]. They continue to be popular in modern books, films, video-games and other entertainments. Dragonslayer-themed stories are also sometimes seen as having a [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaoskampf]] theme - in which a heroic figure struggles against a monster that epitomises chaos.

==Description==
[[Image:Paul Gustave Dore Andromeda.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] Chained to a Rock'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1869).]]

A dragonslayer is often the hero in a "[[Princess and dragon]]" tale. In this type of story, the dragonslayer kills the dragon in order to rescue a high-class female character from being devoured by it. This female character often then becomes the love interest of the account. One notable example of this kind of legend is the story of [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Loðbrók]], who slays a giant serpent, thereby rescuing the maiden, [[Þóra borgarhjörtr]], whom he later marries.

There are, however, several notable exceptions to this common motif. In the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], for example, Saint George overcomes the dragon as part of a plot which ends with the conversion of the dragon's grateful victims to Christianity, rather than Saint George being married to the rescued princess character.

In a Norse legend from the [[Völsunga saga]], the dragonslayer, [[Sigurd]], kills [[Fafnir]] - a dwarf who has been turned into a dragon as a result of guarding the cursed ring that had once belonged to the dwarf, [[Andvari]]. After slaying the dragon, Sigurd drinks some of the dragon's blood and thereby gains the ability to understand the speech of birds. He also bathes in the dragon's blood, causing his skin to become invulnerable. Sigurd overhears two nearby birds discussing the heinous treachery being planned by his companion, [[Regin]]. In response to the plot, Sigurd kills Regin, thereby averting the treachery. &lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (1990). Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sigurd the Dragon Slayer. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-23285-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythologists such as [[Joseph Campbell]] have argued that dragonslayer myths can be seen as a psychological metaphor:&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But as Siegfried [Sigurd] learned, he must then taste the dragon blood, in order to take to himself something of that dragon power. When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood, he hears the song of nature. he has transcended his humanity and re-associated himself with the powers of nature, which are powers of our life, and from which our minds remove us.

...Psychologically, the dragon is one's own binding of oneself to one's own ego."
&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Estlin''' "'''E.&amp;nbsp;E.'''" '''Cummings''' (October 14, 1894&amp;nbsp;– September 3, 1962), often styled as '''e&amp;nbsp;e&amp;nbsp;cummings''', as he is attributed in many of his published works,&lt;ref name="chicago84"/&gt; was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.

Cummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has original syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun ''I'' as ''i'', as in the phrase "i shall go". Cummings was politically neutral much of his life until the rise of the [[Cold War]] when he became a Republican and a supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]]. He taught briefly at Harvard University in the 1950s, before his death in 1962.

==Life==

===Early years===
Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Leo W. ''This is Our Church''. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings' parents supported his creative gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/cummings/cummings_life.htm|title=E. E. Cummings' Life|website=english.illinois.edu|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on [[Silver Lake (Madison, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]] in [[Madison, New Hampshire]], where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby [[Joy Farm]] where Cummings had his primary summer residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wpkDRPueLiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=E.E. Cummings: A Biography|first=Christopher|last=Sawyer-Lauçanno|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He expressed [[transcendentalism|transcendental]] leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an [[I and Thou|"I, Thou"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ''"le bon Dieu"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as "Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen."). Cummings "also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; &amp; may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cummings.html |title=E.

Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1915 and received a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the university in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Co-Da/Cummings-E-E.html |title=E.

Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/e-e-cummings|title=E. E. Cummings|date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harvard Monthly vol 56.jpg|thumb|right|Masthead from volume 56 of ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''; Cummings was an editor and contributor to this literary journal while at Harvard]]

===War years===
In 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps]]. On the boat to France, he met William Slater Brown. They became fast friends. Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings and Brown were not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time the two of them explored Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.&lt;ref name=utexas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E. Cummings: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman "Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Ferté-Macé|Dépôt de Triage]]'', in [[La Ferté-Macé]], Orne, Normandy.&lt;ref name=utexas/&gt;

They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, "Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, p. 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings' name?  In a direct quote, it matters. --&gt;

Cummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth|title=Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I, WWI, The Great War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |source ="Buffalo Bill's" (1920)}}

===Post-war years===
Cummings returned to Paris in 1921 and had lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.&lt;ref Name="PoetryF"/&gt;

During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924–1927).

In 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem "my father moved through dooms of love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

In the 1930s Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings' publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher.

===Final years===
[[File:EECummingsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of E. E. Cummings]]

In 1952, his alma mater, [[Harvard University]], awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as ''i: six nonlectures''.

Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, [[Joy Farm]], in [[Silver Lake, New Hampshire]].

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
[[File:EECummings pd4.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketched self-portrait circa 1920]]
Cummings was married briefly twice, first to Elaine Orr, then to Anne Minnerly Barton. His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a common-law marriage to Marion Morehouse.

Cummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.

Cummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.

In 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a [[common-law marriage]] until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
According to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,&lt;ref name=Blumenkranz&gt;Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 "The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism."] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/modern/cummings_ee.html|title=Heath Anthology of American Literature E.E. cummings – Author Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his radical and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] public image, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and later, an ardent supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910–1960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2DB77ccf9sC&amp;pg=PA449 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Poetry===
Despite Cummings' familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (likely affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of French poet [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation&lt;ref&gt;Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}&lt;/ref&gt;), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.

&lt;!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**---&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;

As well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is "frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.

While some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to "paint a picture" with some of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,&lt;br&gt;
HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,&lt;br&gt;
FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
LOVE, YOU DEAR,&lt;br&gt;
ESTLIN.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.

Some of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right
 |quote  =&lt;poem&gt;

Cummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, "they sowed their isn't"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in "in Just"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features words such as "mud-luscious", "puddle-wonderful", and "eddieandbill." This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has many references comparing the "balloonman" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P. Blackmur]] has commented that this use of language is "frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Cummings' poems are satirical and address social issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |title="why must itself up every of a park" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813233241/http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |title="anyone lived in a pretty how town" |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726121247/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.

===Controversy===
Cummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;poem&gt;
:one day a nigger
:caught in his hand
:a little star no bigger
:than not to understand

:i'll never let you go
:until you've made me white"
:so she did and now
:stars shine at night.&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"&gt;Cummings, ''Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems''. New York: Oxford UP, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

and

&lt;poem&gt;
:a kike is the most dangerous
:machine as yet invented
:by even  yankee ingenu
:ity(out of a jew a few
:dead dollars and some twisted laws)
:it comes both prigged and canted&lt;ref name="Cummings, 1950"/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Friends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. "America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' &amp; Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'" he said.&lt;ref Name="Reef"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.&lt;ref Name="Reef"&gt;''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=April 2018}}

===Plays===
During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''HIM'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are "Him", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and "Me", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].

Cummings said of the unorthodox play:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff—relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'—like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. &lt;small&gt;DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.&lt;/small&gt;"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three "infrahumans", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "man", in the sense of "mankind".

''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a "synopsis" as well as descriptions of four "episodes", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.

===Name and capitalization===
Cummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.&lt;ref name="friedman92"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114–21 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings "had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer | location = Carbondale | publisher=Southern Illinois University Press | year = 1964 | isbn = 0-8093-0978-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cummings' widow, however, this is incorrect.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; She wrote to Friedman: "You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid &amp; childish statement about Cummings &amp; his signature." On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1995 | title = Not "e. e. cummings" Revisited | journal=Spring | volume = 5 | pages = 41–43 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lowercase, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.&lt;ref name="friedman92" /&gt; Additionally, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalizion of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes "E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name."&lt;ref name="chicago84"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Captalization of Personal Names|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented "The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed "Twenty Poems" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings' poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]]. It was performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.

Numerous composers have set Cummings' poems to music:
* In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed "Cummings ist der dichter" from poems by E.E. Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/|title=cummings ist der dichter, Pierre Boulez}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aribert Reimann]] set Cummings to music in "Impression IV" (1961) for soprano and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2743128|title=Impression IV : nach einem Gedicht von E.E.

* [[Morton Feldman]] (1926-1987) in 1951 composed "4 Songs to e.e. cummings" for soprano, piano and cello, using material from Cummings' "50 poems" of 1940: "!Blac", "Air", "(Sitting In A Tree-)" and "(Moan)".
* The Icelandic singer [[Björk]] used lines from Cummings's poem "I Will Wade Out" for the lyrics of "Sun in My Mouth" on her 2001 album ''[[Vespertine]].'' On her next album, ''[[Medúlla]]'' (2004), Björk used his poem "It May Not Always Be So" as the lyrics for the song "Sonnets/Unrealities XI."
* The American composer [[Eric Whitacre]] wrote a [[Eric Whitacre#SATB choral|cycle of works]] for choir titled ''The City and the Sea'', which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music.
* Others who have composed settings for his poems include [[Dominic Argento]], [[William Bergsma]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[John Cage]], [[Romeo Cascarino]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Serge de Gastyne]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], [[John Woods Duke|John Duke]], [[Margaret Garwood]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Michael Hedges]], [[Richard Hundley]], [[Barbara Kolb]], [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[Robert Manno]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[John Musto]], [[Paul Nordoff]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Peter Schickele]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Aki Takase]], [[Hugo Weisgall]], [[Dan Welcher]], and [[James Yannatos]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/c/cummings/ "E.E.

The council of '''Eight Men''' was an early representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous [[Twelve Men]] and was followed by the [[Nine Men]].

==Council==
In 1643 [[Abraham Pietersen Van Deusen]] who had served on the [[council of twelve men]] was appointed to a new council of eight men. The council contacted the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] and blamed governor [[Willem Kieft]] for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the [[Kieft's War|war]] with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. They requested that a new [[Director-General of New Netherland]] be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664. Kieft returned to Holland, but the vessel, the [[Princess Amelia (1634 ship)|''Princess Amelia'']] was lost at sea and his body was never recovered. John Franklin Jameson (1859–1937) writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonalty were called together; they were sore distressed. They chose eight, in the stead of the previous twelve, persons to aid in consulting for the best; but the occupation every one had to take care of his own, prevented anything beneficial being adopted at that time. nevertheless it was resolved that as many Englishmen as were to be got in the country should be enlisted, who were indeed now proposing to depart; the third part of these were to be paid by the commonalty; this promise was made by the commonalty but was not followed by the pay.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Council Members==
The council members were:&lt;ref&gt;New York State; O'Callaghan, EB; Broadhead, John Romeyn: ''Documents relative to the colonial history of the state of New York, Vol. I'', p. 191, 1856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=oC0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=council+twelve+kieft+brodhead&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPA191,M1 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/projects/New-Amsterdam-Notable-Citizens&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1643 a minor altercation with Indians evolved into a serious uprising followed by an ugly slaughter of Weckquaskeek Indians on Manhattan Island. Kieft feared a major Indian assault. Allerton was asked by Kieft to join a "group of 8 men" to help New Amsterdam. Because he was English and respected in New Haven, Kieft sent Allerton and another Englishman to New Haven in 1643 to ask for men and materials to help defend New Amsterdam. In addition, the "group of 8" was asked to propose measures to improve civility and law-and-order in New Amsterdam. New Haven refused to send men to support the Dutch but Kieft entered into an agreement with the Indians in 1645 that settled the dispute. Because of Kieft's dictatorial manner, several of the eight men petitioned the WIC directors to recall Kieft as Director-General. In time Kieft was replaced by Peter Stuyvesant, and the men initiating the recall petition were accused of insurrection and faced punishment. Allerton was the second signatory of the petition but was not the group's primary spokesman. In 1646, Allerton established a permanent residence in New Haven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flag (Standard) of the President of Belarus''' ({{Lang-be|Штандар Прэзідэнта Рэспублікі Беларусь}}) is the official symbol of the [[President of Belarus]]. It is used at buildings and on vehicles to denote the presence of the President.

The presidential standard, which has been in use since 1997, was adopted by a decree called "Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus".

== Design ==
The standard's design is an exact copy of the national flag, with the addition of the [[National emblem of Belarus|Belarusian national emblem]] in gold and red. The standard's ratio of 5:6 differs from that of the national flag, making the standard almost square. The Presidential Flag is framed with golden fringes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://old.bankzakonov.com/obsch/razdel192/time6/lavz5977.htm Decree dated March 27, 1997, creating the presidential standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The original version of the Presidential Standard is kept in the office of the President at the [[Independence Palace, Minsk|Independence Palace]]. The duplicates of Presidential Flag can be placed in the halls or rooms of the Independence Palace or Presidential residences if any official event is intended to be conducted in the presence of the President;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.belta.by/president/view/belarus-president-meets-with-supreme-court-chairman-111494-2018/ Belarus President meets with Supreme Court chairman]&lt;/ref&gt; on other premises when the President of Belarus is visiting; in the hall of the building, where official or other types of events are being held with the participation of the President of Belarus; and on the vehicles of the President.

Presidential flag is also used during inauguration ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.gov.by/en/news_en/view/belarus-presidents-inauguration-ceremony-on-6-november-12501/ Belarus President’s inauguration ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Forgotten Ten''' ({{lang-ga|An Deichniúr Dearmadta}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/the_forgotten_ten__an_deichni%C3%BAr_dearmadta_part_1|title=The Forgotten Ten An Deichniúr Dearmadta Part 1|work=World News|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the term applied to ten members of the [[Irish Republican Army]] who were executed in [[Mountjoy Prison]], [[Dublin]] by British forces following [[court martial|courts martial]] from 1920–21 during the [[Irish War of Independence]].

Based upon military law at the time, they were buried within the prison precincts, their graves unmarked in the [[Consecration|unconsecrated ground]].  The names of the Forgotten Ten are [[Kevin Barry]], [[Patrick Moran (Irish republican)|Patrick Moran]], [[Frank Flood]], [[Thomas Whelan]], [[Thomas Traynor]], [[Patrick Doyle (Irish republican)|Patrick Doyle]], [[Edmond Foley]], Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, and Patrick Maher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm A Brief History Of The National Graves Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}, nga.ie; accessed 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign for reburial==
Following the [[Irish War of Independence]], Mountjoy Prison was transferred to the control of the [[Irish Free State]], which became the State of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1937. In the 1920s, the families of the dead men requested their remains be returned to them for proper burial. This effort was joined in the later 1920s by the [[National Graves Association]].  Through the efforts of the Association, the graves of the men were identified in 1934, and in 1996 a [[Celtic cross]] was erected in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] to commemorate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm Source 1. above] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State funeral==
[[Image:The Forgotten Ten.jpg|thumb|The grave of nine of the Forgotten Ten in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin]]
The campaign to rebury the men dragged on for 80 years from their deaths. Following an intense period of negotiations, the Irish government relented. Plans to exhume the bodies of the 10 men were announced on 1 November 2000, the 80th anniversary of the execution of Kevin Barry. On 14 October 2001, the Forgotten Ten were afforded full state honours, with a private service at Mountjoy Prison for the families of the dead, a [[requiem mass]] at [[St Mary's Pro-Cathedral]] and burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', some criticised the event as glorifying militant [[Irish republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland Dublin State Funeral for IRA Men], Guardian.co.uk; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincided with the [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Ardfheis|party conference]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland|title=Dublin state funeral for IRA men|author=Rosie Cowan|work=the Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progress of the cortège through the centre of Dublin was witnessed by crowds estimated as being in the tens of thousands who broke into spontaneous applause as the coffins passed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1359518/Ahern-defends-1921-IRA-men's-state-funeral.html Ahern defends 1921 IRA men's state funeral ] 14 Oct 2001 Telegraph.co.uk : Accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On [[O'Connell Street]], a lone piper played a lament as the cortege paused outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]], the focal point of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; In his homily during the requiem mass, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Cahal Daly]], a long-time critic of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|the IRA campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]], insisted that there was a clear distinction between the conflict of 1916–22 and the paramilitary-led violence of the previous 30 years:

{{quote|
The true inheritors today of the ideals of the men and women of 1916 to 1922 are those who are explicitly and visibly committed to leaving the physical force tradition behind... Surely this state funeral can be an occasion for examination of conscience about the ideals of the men who died, and about our responsibility for translating those ideals into today's realities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDD113FF936A25753C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Irish Rebury 10 Republicans Hanged by British in 1920s], New York Times; accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his graveside oration the [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] echoed these sentiments and also paid tribute to the Ten:{{quote|These 10 young men were executed during the War of Independence. The country was under tremendous pressure at the time. There was a united effort. Meanwhile, elected by the people, Dáil Éireann was developing, in spite of a war going on. Democracy was being put to work. Independent civic institutions, including the Dáil courts, were beginning to function. Before their deaths, the ten had seen the light of freedom. They understood that Ireland would be free and independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.eircom.net/~dankiely/pressreleases.html PRESS RELEASE: 17 October 2001], eircom.net; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15427">The '''Frank Gardiner–Ben Hall Gang''' was an informal group of [[bushranger]]s who roamed the central west of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in the 1860s.

== Gang activities ==

John Peisley was born at Bathurst in 1835. While a teenager, he became a notorious horse thief in the area. He was convicted and sentenced to serve time on Cockatoo Island near [[Sydney]], where he met [[Frank Gardiner]].  In December 1860, Peisley gained his [[ticket of leave]], on the condition that he remain in the [[Hunter Region|Hunter River Valley]] area.  He absconded to the Abercrombie Ranges, where his parents once lived, and became a lone [[highwayman|highway robber]], "sticking up" travellers in the area south and west of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].

Gardiner was granted a ticket of leave in December 1859 on the condition of staying in the [[Carcoar, New South Wales|Carcoar]] district, and he soon joined up with Peisley. [[John Gilbert (bushranger)|Johnny Gilbert]] joined them soon afterwards, and the gang started stealing cattle and horses. Gardiner's [[ticket of leave]] was revoked when a warrant for his arrest for cattle stealing was issued.
 
Gardiner had a partnership with William Fogg in a butcher shop at Spring Creek. Gardiner supplied Fogg with stolen cattle, and Fogg would slaughter the cattle and sell the meat.

===1861===
*May: Gardiner, Peisley and Gilbert robbed mail in [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]].
*16 July: Sgt. John Middleton and Constable William Hosie went to Fogg's house in search of Gardiner. He was briefly captured after a gunfight, but he was rescued by Peisley and John Gilbert, who ambushed the police on their return to town.
*25 December: Peisley shot William Benyon, who died seven days later.

===1862===
*29 January: Peisley was captured and committed for trial by the Carcoar bench for murdering an innkeeper at [[Bigga, New South Wales|Bigga]].  Within two months he was convicted and hanged at Bathurst.
*January: "The Three Jacks" &amp;ndash; Davis, McGuinness, and Connors &amp;ndash; committed their first robberies with Gardiner.
*10 April: Davis was wounded four times by police near [[Young, New South Wales|Lambing Flat]]. His companions, the other two Jacks, escaped.
*13 April: McGuiness was found dead near where Davis was captured; he had been shot.
*14 April: Gardiner, Hall, Youngman, and Gilbert robbed [[Wagon|dray]] near [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]].
In 1862, John Gilbert was first named as an accomplice of Gardiner when they and two others held up a storekeeper.  Just over a month later, John Gilbert was involved in another robbery, this time with Gardiner and Ben Hall. From then on John Gilbert was identified as being involved in several hold-ups between Lambing Flat and Lachlan.
*25 April: Peisley was hanged in Bathurst.
[[Image:Escort Rock near Eugowra NSW.jpg|thumb|left|the location of the robbery at Eugowra Rocks]]
*15 June: Frank Gardiner enlisted the assistance of John Gilbert, Ben Hall, John O'Meally, Dan Charters, Henry Manns, Alexander Fordyce, and Johnny Bow to rob the Forbes gold escort, at a place called [[Eugowra, New South Wales|Eugowra Rocks]], of banknotes and 2700 ounces of gold worth more than £14,000.
*27 July: Hall and several others were arrested. Charters turned [[Queen's evidence]] but failed to name Hall or O'Meally.
*23 August: Hall was released. Gardiner left the district and moved to Queensland.

===1863===
*1 January: Fred Lowry shot a man whilst robbing the Brisbane Valley races (near the head of Fish River Creek) with John Foley. Lowry robbed settlers at Wambanamba. Lowry shot John Mcbride, who died from his leg wound.
* 13 February: Fred Lowry had been captured and placed in Bathurst Jail. On Feb 13 he had a mattock secreted into the jail and smashed a hole in the jail wall. Five prisoners escaped. Three escapees were caught that day. Fred Lowry and William Woodhart escaped capture. Lowry and Woodhart joined up with Gardiner.
*12 May: William Woodhart caught at Fowlow by Senior Constable Reilly and brought into Braidwood.
*13 July: Johnny Gilbert and John O'Meally, led by Ben Hall, held up the Commercial Bank at Carcoar.  A brave teller in the bank fired a shot into the ceiling of the bank, thwarting the robbery. The manager was shot outside the bank as he was returning to the bank, and the gang fled without seizing anything.  This was Australia's first bank robbery, and it took place in broad daylight.
*13 July: Lowry, with Cummins and John Foley, robbed the [[Mudgee, New South Wales|Mudgee]] mailcoach.
*August: John O'Meally shot dead John Barnes, a shopkeeper near [[Wallendbeen, New South Wales|Wallendbeen]].
*30 August: Fred Lowry died from wounds after a shootout with police at [[Crookwell, New South Wales|Crookwell]] the night before. Cummins was arrested.
*7 September: Francis Foley was sentenced to ten years "on the roads", with the first year in irons. Francis' brother, John Foley, was sentenced on the same day to fifteen years hard labour, with the first three in irons.
*23 September 1863, Patrick Daley sentenced to fifteen years on the roads
*27 September: First raid on Canowindra.
*1 October: John Gilbert, Ben Hall, John O’Meally, and two Mount Macquarie lads, John Vane and Micky Burke, held up a jeweller’s shop and the Sportsman’s Arms Hotel in Bathurst in broad daylight.  They exchanged shots with police as they made their escape down George Street.  Three days later they returned to rob more stores, houses, and hotels on the outskirts of the town.
*12 October: Hall and his gang bailed up Robinson's Hotel in [[Canowindra, New South Wales|Canowindra]] and held all the people of the town captive for three days. The hostages were allegedly not mistreated, and were provided with entertainment. The local policeman was subjected to humiliation by being locked in his own cell.  When the hostages were set free, the gang insisted on paying the hotelier and giving the townspeople "expenses".
*24 October: Twenty-year-old Michael Burke’s bushranging career ended at Rockley. Holding up Gold Commissioner Keightley, he was wounded in the stomach and, believing he was about to die, shot himself in the head.  While he was still alive and in pain, one of his friends killed him (the coroner named Hall as the person who fired the shot).
*3 November: Third raid on Canowindra.
*18 November: John Vane surrendered to police. Vane was sentenced to fifteen years; he was released in 1870.
*19 November: John O'Meally was shot dead during a raid on Goimbla station.

*25 September: The gang robbed a mail coach near [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]].

*26 December: Hall, Gilbert, and Dunn bail up the town of [[Binda, New South Wales|Binda]]. Hall burned down Morriss’s store as an act of revenge after Morriss escaped and alerted police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tablelandsway.com.au/experience-trails/bushrangers-of-upper-lachlan/ |title=Bushrangers of Upper Lachlan |access-date=23 August 2018 |work=The Tablelands Way |publisher=[[Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism]], [[Australian Government]] |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100430022752/http://www.tablelandsway.com.au:80/experience-trails/bushrangers-of-upper-lachlan/ |archive-date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1865===
*26 January: Hall, Gilbert, and Dunn were at [[Collector, New South Wales|Collector]], near [[Lake George (New South Wales)|Lake George]].

*10 April: Robbed Watts’s Inn, Austin’s inn, and Gallimore’s store at Black Rock.
*21 April: The gang robbed Yamma Station.
*May: Hall, Gilbert, and Dunn were proclaimed outlaws. The ''[[Felons Apprehension Act 1865|Felons Apprehension Act]]'' was passed, which allowed known [[bushrangers]] to be shot and killed rather than taken to trial. This put the members of the gang outside the law and liable to be killed by anyone.
*5 May: Hall had separated from the other two and later was surrounded by police and shot dead in the bush near Forbes .
*12 May: Gilbert and Dunn, on hearing the news of Hall's death, headed for Dunn's grandfather's property at Murrumbarrah.

[[Image:JohnGilbertGraveInfo.JPG|thumb|right]]

*13 May: The [[Binalong, New South Wales|Binalong]] Police Station Senior Constable Charles Hales thought they might visit John Kelly, Dunn's grandfather. On the morning of the 13th of May, John Kelly informed Senior Constable Hales that Gilbert and Dunn were at his hut. Hales gathered Constables John Bright, Michael King, and Henry Hall and headed to Kelly's place. Two parties were formed: Bright and Hall went to the back of the hut and were stationed in the creek, while Hales and King were stationed at the front of the hut.

:As Hales and King approached the hut, the dogs started barking. Bushrangers ran out the back of the hut firing their guns, and kept up the fire as they got through a bush fence that led to the creek. They positioned themselves behind a large tree. Gilbert fired his revolving rifle at Hales and Bright, but it misfired. Meanwhile, King and Hall took up positions. Dunn and Gilbert started firing their revolvers at Hall and King and ran down to the creek. Hales and Bright immediately fired at the bushrangers; Gilbert was shot and died instantly.

:Hales ordered his men to follow and to chase Dunn. The three constables chased Dunn for about a mile and a half; they were exhausted and had to give up the pursuit. Dunn stole a horse from nearby Bogolong station and wasn't heard from again for seven months.

*18 December: Dunn was recognized by Police at McPhails Station near [[Walgett, New South Wales|Walgett]]. A week later on the 26th of December, after a gunfight with police, he was wounded and captured near [[Coonamble, New South Wales|Coonamble]].&lt;ref name=career/&gt; He was tried on 19 January 1866; the jury took ten minutes to find him guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to hang.  He was hanged in [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] on 19 March 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18702710 |title=Execution of Dunn |date=22 March 1866 |newspaper=[[The Maitland Mercury &amp; Hunter River General Advertiser]] |access-date=24 January 2013 |via=[[Trove]] |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Grossman Stern''' and '''Michael Stern''' (both born 1946) are American writers who specialize in books about travel, food, and popular culture. They are best known for their ''[[Roadfood]]'' books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find [[road food]] restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the [[haute cuisine]] of other nations. 

Since the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book ''Square Meals'' (Knopf 1985) put "[[comfort food]]s" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. ''Square Meals'' did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time.     

Jane Grossman grew up in [[New York City]], where she attended the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]] and received a BFA in graphic design at [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at [[Yale University]] and their first date, at [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana|Pepe's Pizza]] in New Haven, had a food focus.&lt;ref name=Ephron&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from [[Columbia University]] in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.

After a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at [[Hunter College]] and another at [[Wesleyan University]] they began work on the book that eventually became the first ''Roadfood''. The book was conceived as a book on "truck-stop dining," funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes.&lt;ref name=Ephron/&gt; The resulting first edition of ''Roadfood'' was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.

In addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' bestselling]] ''Elvis World'' (1987) and ''The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste'' (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine for 18 years, have written for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and are now contributing editors at ''[[Saveur]]''. 

They are regular guests on [[American Public Media]]'s public radio program, ''[[The Splendid Table]]''. They have won numerous awards, including [[James Beard award]]s, and were inducted into [[James Beard Foundation Award#Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America|Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesbeard.org/index.php?q=james_beard_awards_whos_who Who’s Who of Food &amp; Beverage in America], the James Beard Foundation website, accessed September 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Gordinier| first = Jeff| title = Serious Eats and Roadfood Are Sold to Fexy Media| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2017-11-13| date = 2015-06-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/dining/serious-eats-roadfood-websites-sold-to-fexy-media.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.&lt;ref name="eater-2015jun02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eater.com/2015/6/2/8704397/serious-eats-roadfood-seattle-fexy-media |title=Serious Eats Is Acquired by Seattle-Based Fexy Media: Roadfood has also been sold to Fexy Media. |website=Eater |date=June 2, 2015 |first=Daniela |last=Galarza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jane Stern published ''Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT'', a memoir in which she described suffering from severe [[clinical depression]] when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an [[emergency medical technician]] in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a [[television movie]], ''[[Ambulance Girl]]'', for which actress [[Kathy Bates]] was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, ''Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food'', in 2006. 

The couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team.&lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

In 2011 the former couple published ''The Lexicon of Real American Food'', and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a [[tarot card reader]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16216">'''King Arthur's family''' grew throughout the centuries with [[King Arthur]]'s legend. Several of the legendary members of this mythical king's family became leading characters of mythical tales in their own right.

==In medieval Welsh literature==
[[File:Uther Pendragon by W. H. Margetson.png|thumb|upright|''Uther Pendragon'' by [[William Henry Margetson|W. H. Margetson]] (1914)]]

In Welsh Arthurian literature from before the time of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), Arthur was granted numerous relations and family members. Several early Welsh sources are usually taken as indicative of [[Uther Pendragon]] being known as Arthur's father before Geoffrey wrote, with Arthur also being granted a brother ([[Madoc ap Uthyr|Madog]]) and a nephew ([[Eliwlod]]) in these texts.&lt;ref&gt;T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.145–51; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at pp.53-4&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur also appears to have been assigned a sister in this material – [[Gawain|Gwalchmei]] is named as his sister-son (nephew) in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', his mother being one Gwyar.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.372–3&lt;/ref&gt; ''Culhwch and Olwen'', the ''Vita Iltuti'' and the ''[[Brut Dingestow]]'' combine to suggest that Arthur had a mother too, named [[Igraine|Eigyr]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this immediate family, Arthur was said to have had a great variety of more distant relatives, including maternal aunts, uncles, cousins and a grandfather named [[Amlawdd Wledig|Anlawd (or Amlawdd) Wledig]] ("Prince Anlawd"). The latter is the common link between many of these figures and Arthur: thus the relationship of first cousins that is implied or stated between Arthur, [[Culhwch]], [[Illtud]], and Goreu mab Custenhin depends upon all of their mothers being daughters of this Anlawd, who appears to be ultimately a genealogical construct designed to allow such inter-relationships between characters to be postulated by medieval Welsh authors.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur's maternal uncles in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', including Llygatrud Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyt Ennwir and Gweir Baladir Hir, similarly appear to derive from this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;These maternal uncles are named at lines 251-2, 288-90: R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The genealogies from the 13th-century Mostyn MS. 117 assert that Arthur is the son of [[Uther Pendragon|Uthyr]], the son of Custennin, the son of Cynfawr, the son of Tudwal, the son of Morfawr, the son of Eudaf, the son of Cadwr the son of Cynan, the son of [[Caradog ap Bran|Caradoc]], the son of [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]], the son of [[Llŷr]].

Regarding Arthur's own family, his wife is consistently stated to be [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]], usually the daughter of King [[Leodegrance|Ogrfan Gawr]] (variation: 'Gogrfan Gawr', "[G]Ogrfan the Giant") and sister to [[Gwenhwyach]], although ''Culhwch'' and ''Bonedd yr Arwyr'' do indicate that Arthur also had some sort of relationship with Eleirch daughter of Iaen, which produced a son named Kyduan (Cydfan).&lt;ref&gt;See T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.151–5; R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.76–7, 107-08 -- the latter note that the sons of Iaen appear to have been kinsmen of Arthur on ''their'' father's side, not Arthur's father's side, i.e. they were Arthur's in-laws via their sister&lt;/ref&gt; Kyduan was not the only child of Arthur according to Welsh Arthurian tradition – he is also ascribed sons called Amr (Anir),&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]] and also the romance ''[[Geraint and Enid]]'', which mentions an "Amhar son of Arthur"&lt;/ref&gt; Gwydre,&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116-7&lt;/ref&gt; Llacheu&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.416–8&lt;/ref&gt; and Duran.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rowland, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion'' (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250–1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other medieval literature==
[[File:Guinever by W. H. Margetson.png|left|thumb|upright|''Guinevere'' by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]

Relatively few members of Arthur's family in the Welsh materials are carried over to the works of Geoffrey and the [[Chivalric romance|chivalric romancers]]. His grandfather Anlawd Wledic and his maternal uncles, aunts and cousins do not appear there, and neither do any of his sons or his paternal relatives. Only the core family seem to have made the journey: his wife Gwenhwyfar (who became [[Guinevere]]), his father [[Uther]], his mother ([[Igerna]]) and his sister-son Gwalchmei ([[Gawain]]). Gwalchmei's mother – Arthur's sister – failed to make the journey, Gwyar's place being taken by Anna, the wife of [[King Lot|Loth]], in Geoffrey's account, whilst Medraut ([[Mordred]]) is made into a second sister-son for Arthur (a status he does not have in the Welsh material).&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Roberts, "Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' and ''Brut Y Brenhinedd''" in R. Bromwich, A. O. H. Jarman and B. F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.98–116 at pp.112–3&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Morgan le Fay by W. H. Margetson.jpg|thumb|upright|''Morgan le Fay'' by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]

In addition, new family members enter the Arthurian tradition from this point onwards. Uther is given a new family, including two brothers and a father,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|Book 8.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; while Arthur gains a sister, [[Morgan le Fay]] (first named as Arthur's sister by [[Chrétien de Troyes]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Arthurian Romances'' trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and a new son, Loholt, in Chrétien's ''Eric and Enide'', the ''[[Perlesvaus]]'' and the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthurian Romances'' trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991); ''The High Book of the Grail: A translation of the thirteenth century romance of Perlesvaus'' trans. N. Bryant (Brewer, 1996); ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'' trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another significant new family-member is Arthur's half-sister [[Morgause]], the daughter of Gorlois and Igerna and mother of Gawain and Mordred in the French romances (replacing Geoffrey of Monmouth's Anna in this role). In the Vulgate ''Mort Artu'' we find [[Mordred]]'s relationship with Arthur once more reinterpreted, as he is made the issue of an unwitting incestuous liaison between Arthur and this Morgause, with Arthur dreaming that Mordred would grow up to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'' trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; This tale is preserved in all the romances based on the ''Mort Artu'', and by the time of Malory's ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' Arthur has started to plot, [[Herod the Great|Herod]]-like, to kill all children born on the same day as Mordred in order to save himself from this fate.&lt;ref&gt;See A. Varin, "Mordred, King Arthur's Son" in ''Folklore'' 90 (1979), pp.167–77 on Mordred's birth, its origins and Arthur's reaction to his dream.&lt;/ref&gt; A third half-sister, [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine of Garlot|Elaine]], is also added at this time. Through his sisters, Arthur is given further nephews ([[Gareth]], [[Gaheris]], [[Agravain]], [[Ywain]], and [[Galeschin]]) who become Knights of the [[Round Table]]. {{clear left}}

==Descendants==
Although Arthur is given sons in both early and late Arthurian tales, he is rarely granted significant further generations of descendants; this is at least partly because of the premature deaths of his sons in these legends. Amr is the first to be mentioned in Arthurian literature, appearing in the 9th-century ''[[History of the Britons|Historia Brittonum]]'':

:"There is another wonder in the region which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; and the name of the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it sometimes six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length – and I myself have put this to the test."&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Why Arthur chose to kill his son is never made clear. The only other reference to Amr comes in the post-Galfridian Welsh romance ''[[Geraint and Enid|Geraint]]'', where "Amhar son of Arthur" is one of Arthur’s four chamberlains along with [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]]'s son Amhren.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), p.231&lt;/ref&gt; Gwydre is similarly unlucky, being slaughtered by the giant boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', along with two of Arthur's maternal uncles – no other references to either Gwydre or Arthur's uncles survive.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116–7 and note on Gwydre; T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), pp.132, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

More is known of Arthur's son Llacheu. He is one of the "Three Well-Endowed Men of the Island of Britain", according to the [[Welsh Triads|Triad]] 4, and he fights alongside [[Sir Kay|Cei]] in the early Arthurian poem ''[[Pa gur|Pa gur yv y porthaur?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), no. 4; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father is in ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', Llacheu appears in the 12th-century and later Welsh poetry as a standard of heroic comparison and he also seems to have been similarly a figure of local topographic folklore too.&lt;ref&gt;[[O. J. Padel]], ''Arthur in Medieval Welsh Literature'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), pp.55–6, 99; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, it is generally agreed that all these references indicate that Llacheu was a figure of considerable importance in the early Arthurian cycle.&lt;ref&gt;T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.168-9&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Llacheu too dies, with the speaker in the pre-Galfridian poem ''Ymddiddan Gwayddno Garanhir ac Gwyn fab Nudd'' remembering that he had "been where Llacheu was slain / the son of Arthur, awful in songs / when ravens croaked over blood."&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Coe and S. Young, ''The Celtic Sources for the Arthurian Legend'' (Llanerch, 1995), p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Loholt is treacherously killed by [[Sir Kay]] so that the latter can take credit for the defeat of the giant Logrin in the ''[[Perlesvaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The High Book of the Grail: A translation of the 13th-century romance of Perlesvaus'' trans. N. Bryant (Brewer, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, known only from a possibly 15th-century Welsh text, is said to have died on the field of [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]]:

:Sandde Bryd Angel drive the crow
:off the face of ?Duran [son of Arthur].
:Dearly and belovedly his mother raised him.
::Arthur sang it&lt;ref&gt;J. Rowland, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion'' (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Medraut/Mordred is an exception to this tradition of a childless death for Arthur's sons. Mordred, like Amr, is killed by Arthur – at Camlann – according to Geoffrey of Monmouth and the post-Galfridian tradition but, unlike the others, he is ascribed [[Sons of Mordred|two]] sons, both of whom rose against Arthur's successor and cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]] with the help of the Saxons. However, in Geoffrey's ''Historia'' (when Arthur's killing of Mordred and Mordred's sons first appear), Mordred was not yet actually Arthur's son.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 11#2|Book 11.2-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later literature has expanded Arthur's family further. [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s 16th-century romance ''[[Tom a Lincoln]]'' adds another illegitimate son, the eponymous Tom. Through Tom, Arthur is also given grandsons referred to only as the [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]] and [[Faerie Knight]]. Other works, such as [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'', [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Bridal of Triermain]]'' and modern film and television adaptations of Arthurian legend, have occasionally given Arthur daughters, diverging from the earlier legends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12331">'''Legal name''' is the [[name]] that identifies a person for legal, administrative and other official purposes. A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of [[Civil registry|registration of the birth]] and which then appears on a [[birth certificate]] (see ''[[birth name]]''), but may change subsequently. Most [[Jurisdiction|jurisdictions]] require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a [[name change]] to be recorded at [[marriage]]. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes his/her first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually eighteen or over, though it can be as low as fourteen in several European nations).

A person's legal name typically is the same as his/her [[personal name]], comprising a [[given name]] and a [[family name]]. The order varies according to culture and country. There are also country-by-country differences on changes of legal names by marriage. (See ''[[married name]]''.)

Most countries require by law the registration of a name for newborn children, and some can refuse registration of "undesirable" names. In 1991, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] couple refused to give their newborn a legal name, in protest of existing naming laws. In 1996, they were fined for not registering a name for their child for five years, after they unsuccessfully tried to register the child's name as [[Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Baby named Metallica rocks Sweden|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6525475.stm|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then as "A".

==Jurisdiction by country==
===Canada===
====Quebec====
The ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' states that "Every person exercises his civil rights under the name assigned to him and stated in his act of birth,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spouses retain their legal names upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|393}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be changed, upon registration, only under prescribed conditions, and only where the person is a Canadian citizen who has been domiciled in Québec for at least one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca/en/change-name.html|title= Change of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 1 December 2016|website= etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca|location=Quebec|publisher= Directeur de l'état civil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, names are regulated to a large extent. Apart from possibly [[Married name#Germany|adopting the partner's name]] upon marriage, German citizens may only change their name for a recognised important reason. Among other reasons, a change of names is permitted when the name can give rise to confusion, ridicule, unusual orthographic difficulties, or stigmatization. In certain situations, children's last names may also be changed to their natural, foster or adoptive parent's last name. Transgender people may change their first names. Foreign names in writing systems that are not based on Latin are transliterated according to rules which may conflict with the system of transcribing or transliterating names that is used in the country of origin. Former titles of nobility became integrated into the last names in 1919 but continue to be adapted according to gender and other circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Seeger|first=Bernhard|title=Der Ehe- und Lebenspartnerschaftsname in der notariellen Praxis|year=2002|journal=Mitteilungen des Bayerischen Notarvereins|url=http://www.notare.bayern.de/read.php?datei=UERGUy9NaXR0QmF5Tm90L21pdHRCYXlOb3Q0XzAyLnBkZg==|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320233430/http://www.notare.bayern.de/read.php?datei=UERGUy9NaXR0QmF5Tm90L21pdHRCYXlOb3Q0XzAyLnBkZg==|archivedate=2012-03-20|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, businesses that trade under names other than those of the owner or a corporate entity must display the name of owner and an address at which documents may be served, or the name and registered number of the corporate body and its registered address. The requirements apply to sole traders and partnerships, but there are special provisions for large partnerships where listing all partners would be onerous. 

The information must be shown on any trading premises where the public have access to trade and in documents such as order forms, receipts and, as of January 2007, corporate websites (to be extended later in 2007 to sole trader websites).

====England and Wales====
In strict English law, if there is such a thing as a "''legal''" surname, it is easily changed. In the words of ''A dictionary of American and English law'', "Any one may take on himself whatever surname or as many surnames as he pleases, without statutory licence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rapalje|first1= Stewart|last2= Lawrence|first2= Robert L.|date= 1997|title= A Dictionary of American and English Law with Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws|edition= 3rd|volume= 2|location= [[Clark, New Jersey]]|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange|page= 849|isbn= 978-1-886363-33-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not always seem to have applied to names given in [[baptism]]. As noted by [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] in ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'', "a man may have divers names at divers times, but not divers Christian names."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Butler|editor1-first=Charles|last= Coke|first= Edward|date= 1832|title= The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England|url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=NOgyAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;f=false|edition=19th|volume=1|location= |publisher= |at= Lib.1 Cap.1 Sect. 1, at 3.a|isbn= |author-link= Edward Coke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But in modern practice all names are freely changeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview|title= Change your name by deed poll |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date= 12 April 2017|website= gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes of name are usually effected through [[deed of change of name|deed poll]], optionally enrolled either at the [[High Court of Justice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK | type = si| year = 1994| number = 604| si = Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the [[College of Arms]],&lt;ref name="CONCOA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/services/name-change|title= Changes of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= college-of-arms.gov.uk|publisher= [[College of Arms]]|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a notice recorded in ''[[The London Gazette]]''. Changes may also be made by means of a Royal License obtained through the College of Arms, with similar notice.&lt;ref name="CONCOA"/&gt; These enrolment, licence and notice procedures are useful for having the new name appear in official documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview|title= Change your name by deed poll |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date= 12 April 2017|website= gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
Scots Law allows anyone who wishes to do so to change their forename(s) or surname and such changes may be recorded in the official register held by the [[National Records of Scotland]].  Technically the Registrar General makes a correction to the entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/about-registration-in-scotland|title=About registration in Scotland|last=|first=|date=21 July 2018|website=National Records of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A correction can be recorded where a birth has been registered in Scotland, or where a person is the subject in Scotland of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, the Parental Order Register or the Gender Recognition Register.&lt;ref name="NRS"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/rcn1-leaflet.pdf |format=pdf |title=Leaflet RCN1: Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland | publisher=National Records of Scotland |website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk |accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above formalities are not necessary where a spouse/partner assumes the other spouse/partner's surname upon marriage or civil partnership, or reverts back to their original name upon separation, divorce or dissolution of the civil partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Recording Changes of Forename(s) and Surname(s) in Scotland|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland|website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one change of name is allowed in the register where a person has not yet reached the age of 16, and afterwards only one change of forename and three changes of surname may be granted during a person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname.&lt;ref name="NRS" /&gt; Name changes may also be recorded where:

* a decree or certificate has been granted by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]],
* a certified copy of a [[Will (law)|will]], [[Settlement (trust)|settlement]] or [[Trust instrument|deed of trust]] is produced, containing a condition that the person concerned takes a name different from his or her registered name, or
* an alternative forename or surname is used where the registered name is not in an English-language form.&lt;ref name="NRS" /&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
Anyone born or adopted in Northern Ireland is able to change their name with the [[General Register Office (Northern Ireland)|General Register Office of Northern Ireland]] in the following circumstances:&lt;ref name="GRONI"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name|title= Recording a change of name|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2015-10-26|website= nidirect.gov.uk|publisher= [[General Register Office (Northern Ireland)|General Register Office of Northern Ireland]]|access-date= 17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a child's birth registration can be re-registered where its parents have subsequently married, or where a father that had not previously been identified is subsequently entered (whether by declaration, agreement or court order);
* a child's name can be changed once, before the age of 18, upon application by the parents (or adoptive parents, or guardian where the parents are deceased, as the case may be);
* a person aged 18 or over may apply to register one change of forename and three changes of surname during that person's lifetime, provided that at least five years have passed between changes of surname.

A deed poll can also be used in Northern Ireland for this purpose.&lt;ref name="GRONI"/&gt;

===United States===
Most states in the United States follow the [[common law]] which permits [[name change#United States|name changing]] for non-fraudulent purposes. This is actually the most common method, since most women who marry do not petition a court under the statutorily prescribed method, but simply use a new name (typically the husband's, a custom which started under the theory of [[coverture]] where a woman lost her identity and most rights when she married).&lt;ref&gt;''In re Natale'', 527 S.W.2d 402 (Mo. App. 1975); ''In re Kruzel'', 226 N.W.2d 458 (Wis. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most [[List of courts of the United States|state courts]] have held that a legally assumed name (i.e., for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name and usable as their true name, though assumed names are often not considered the person's technically true name.&lt;ref&gt;''Stuart v. Board of Supervisors'', 295 A.2d 223 (Md. Ct. App. 1972); ''In re Hauptly'', 312 N.E.2d 857 (Ind. 1974); ''United States v. Cox'', 593 F.2d 46 (6th Cir. 1979).  ''See also'' 10 U.S.C. § 1551 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''legal name''' of a business is the name under which the business conducts its operations.

'''Line Friends''' (stylized as '''LINE FRIENDS''') are featured characters based on the stickers from messaging app [[Line (software)|Line]]. It was released in 2011 by [[Line Corporation]], a [[Japan|Japanese]] subsidiary of the [[South Korea|South Korean]] internet search giant [[Naver Corporation]]. These characters are used in various products, animation, game, cafe, hotel and theme park. The brand is currently managed by its subsidiary Line Friends Corporation since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/line-friends-has-plans-global-domination|title=Line Friends Has Plans for Global Domination {{!}} License!

Two anime series, LINE OFFLINE and LINE TOWN, were produced in 2013, picturing the Line Friends as employees for the fictional Line Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jpninfo.com/31855|title=Love LINE Friends?

=== Line Offline ===
Line Offline is an animated series created by [[Shogakukan Productions]], based on [[salaryman]] characters working at "Line Corporation". All 114 episodes last about three minutes. The series was aired from January 8, 2013, to October 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/line-offline/|title=Messaging App Line’s Kawaii Characters Get Their Own Cartoon Series In Japan – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes of Line Offline are not connected to each other. The idea behind the series is to represent the ordinary life of company employees (in this case Line's employees, that's why the series is called "Line Offline"), in which every small problem could lead to weird and funny situations that require some effort in order to restore the [[status quo]].

Most characters from Line Offline are part of Line's universe (the characters who are shown in the animated series are also Line Friends, and they can be seen by users in Line Messaging App and used as emoticons).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">'''The Little Tough Guys''' (later billed as 'The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys') were a group of actors who made a series of films and serials released by [[Universal Studios]] from 1938 through 1943.  Many of them were originally part of [[Dead End Kids|The Dead End Kids]], and several of them later became members of [[East Side Kids|The East Side Kids]] and [[The Bowery Boys]].

==History==
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
The urban drama ''Dead End'' became both a successful play and a hit movie, featuring six young actors playing streetwise guttersnipes: [[Billy Halop]], [[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Bobby Jordan]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]. The troupe became known as [[The Dead End Kids]] and starred in a series of features for [[Warner Brothers]].

==Little Tough Guys==
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] borrowed the Dead End Kids (except Gorcey and Jordan) for a juvenile-delinquency drama called ''[[Little Tough Guy]]''. Universal adopted this as a brand name, and turned the film into a series of 'Little Tough Guys' features. The studio filled out the cast with David Gorcey (Leo's younger brother) and [[Hal E. Chester|Hally Chester]]. 

The next three films did not include any of the original Dead End Kids. ''Little Tough Guys in Society'' (1939) was more of a lightweight comedy, while the next two, ''Newsboys' Home'' and ''Code of the Streets'' (1939), were more dramatic. [[Jackie Cooper]] starred in ''Newsboys' Home'', but was not a member of the team. Only David Gorcey and Hally Chester remained from the first film, ''Little Tough Guy''. This was the beginning of the members of the team changing on almost a film-to-film basis. Eleven actors drifted in and out of the series, including [[Frankie Thomas]], Charles Duncan (who was originally hired to play Leo Gorcey's role in the play ''Dead End''), and [[Billy Benedict]]. 

When Warners released Bobby Jordan from his contract, Universal quickly signed him to join the rest of gang. Now, with five of the original six Dead End Kids on the payroll, Universal revised the billing to read "The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys". In total, the Little Tough Guys made 12 feature films, and three 12-chapter serials. Leading player Halop joined the armed forces and was replaced by Jordan for the final film in the series, ''Keep 'Em Slugging'', released in 1943.

[[Shemp Howard]] of the [[Three Stooges]] appeared in ''Give Us Wings'', ''Hit The Road'' and ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]]''. Huntz Hall cited Howard as a major influence when his later "Bowery Boys" series shifted to all-out slapstick comedy.

There was still a market for these tough-teen films, and most of the Little Tough Guys principals wound up at [[Monogram Pictures]] as [[The East Side Kids]] and [[The Bowery Boys]].

A '''mononymous person''' is an individual who is known and addressed by a single name, or mononym.{{efn|From the [[Greek language|Greek]] μόνος, ''mónos'' ("single"), and ὄνομα, ''ónoma'' ("name"). [[Noun]]: "mononym"; [[adverb]]: "mononymously"; [[verb]]: "mononymize"; [[abstract noun]]: "mononymity".&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/0503|title=mononym|date=2003-05-06|publisher=A Word a Day|accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"[[Mononym]]" is defined in ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1989, volume IX, p. 1023) as "A term consisting of one word only […] Hence ''mononymic'' […] a[djective], consisting of a mononym or mononyms; ''mononymy'' […], a mononymic system; ''mononymize'' v[erb], to convert into a mononym; whence ''mononymization''."  The term is attested in the English language as early as 1872.}} In some cases, that name has been selected by the individual, who may have originally been given a [[:Wiktionary:polynym|polynym]] ("multiple name"). In other cases, it has been determined by the custom of the country{{efn|For example, [[Javanese name]]s traditionally are mononymic.}} or by some interested segment. In the case of historical figures, it may be the only one of the individual's names that has survived and is still known today.

== Antiquity ==
[[File:King Narmer.jpg|thumb|Narmer]]

The structure of persons' names has varied across time and geography. In some societies, individuals have been mononymous, receiving only a single name. [[Alulim]], first king of [[Sumer]], is one of the earliest names known; [[Narmer]], an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]], is another. In addition, Biblical names were typically mononymous, as were names in the surrounding cultures of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] names also follow the pattern, with [[epithet]]s (similar to second names) only used subsequently by historians to avoid confusion, as in the case of [[Zeno the Stoic]] and [[Zeno of Elea]]; likewise, [[patronymic]]s or other biographic details (such as [[Polis|city]] of origin, or another city the individual was associated with, borough, occupation) were used to specify whom one was talking about, but these details were not considered part of the name.

A departure from this custom occurred, for example, among the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], who by the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] period [[Tria nomina|used multiple names]]: a male citizen's name comprised three parts (this was mostly typical of the upper class, while others would usually have only two names): ''[[praenomen]]'' (given name), ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' (clan name) and ''[[cognomen]]'' (family line within the clan)&amp;nbsp;— the ''nomen'' and ''cognomen'' were almost always hereditary.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''Dictionary of the Bible'', p. 2060.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mononyms in other ancient cultures include the [[Celts|Celtic]] queen [[Boudica]] and the [[Numidia]]n king [[Jugurtha]]. However, the historical records of some of these figures are scanty or rely completely on the documentation of those outside the person's culture, so it is possible such figures may have had other names within their own cultures that have since been lost to history.

==Medieval uses==

===Europe===
During the [[early Middle Ages]], mononymity slowly declined, with northern and eastern Europe keeping the tradition longer than the south; an example is [[Edeko]], the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic]] chieftain whose son ruled Italy as [[Flavius Odoacer]]. By the end of the period, surnames had become commonplace: [[Edmund Ironside]], for example, ruled England (although Ironside was an epithet added later in life), [[Brian Boru]] was [[High King of Ireland]], [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] had united Scotland, and even in [[Scandinavia]] surnames were taking hold. The [[Dutch Renaissance]] scholar and theologian [[Erasmus]] is a late example of mononymity; though sometimes referred to as "Desiderius Erasmus" or "Erasmus of Rotterdam", he was christened only as "Erasmus", after the [[martyr]] [[Erasmus of Formiae]].

===The Americas===
[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe 1616.jpg|thumb|Pocahontas]]

Between Columbus' arrival in the New World and the late 19th century, most{{cn|date=January 2017}} [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were mononymous. Examples include [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]] (Mexico, 1398–1469), [[Anacaona]] (Haiti, 1464–1504), [[Agüeybaná I|Agüeybaná]] (Puerto Rico, died 1510), [[Diriangen]] (Nicaragua, fl. 1520), [[Urracá]] (Panama, died 1531), [[Guamá]] (Cuba, died 1532), [[Atahualpa]] (Peru, 1497–1533), [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (Honduras, died 1537), [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]] (Chile, 1534–1557), [[Tamanaco]] (Venezuela, died 1573), [[Pocahontas]] (United States, 1595–1617), [[Auoindaon]] (Canada, fl. 1623), [[Cangapol]] (Argentina, fl. 1735), and [[Tecumseh]] (United States, 1768–1813). 

Uniquely, the Dutch-Seneca diplomat [[Cornplanter]] received both a [[Seneca language|Seneca-language]] mononym (Kaintwakon, roughly "corn-planter") from his mother and a given name and surname (John Abeel) from his father, and he used both throughout his life.  His later descendants, such as [[Jesse Cornplanter]], used "Cornplanter" as the family name instead of "Abeel". 

In the 19th century, most chiefs involved in the [[Apache Wars]] had mononym birth names, and some replaced those with mononymous nicknames: [[Geronimo]] (born Goyaałé), [[Victorio]] (born Beduiat), [[Cochise]], and so on.

==Post-medieval uses==
Since the medieval period, mononyms in the West have almost exclusively been used to identify people who already had surnames. These [[nickname]]s were either adopted by the persons themselves or conferred by contemporaries.

===France===
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|Molière]]

Some French authors have shown a preference for mononyms. In the 17th century, the dramatist and actor Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622–73) took the mononym [[stage name]] [[Molière]].

In the 18th century, François-Marie Arouet adopted the mononym [[Voltaire]], for both literary and personal use, in 1718 after his imprisonment in Paris' [[Bastille]], to mark a break with his past. The new name combined several features. It was an [[anagram]] for a [[Latin]]ized version of his family [[surname]], "Arouet, l[e] j[eune]"; it reversed the syllables of the name of a family ''[[château]]'', Airvault; and it has implications of speed and daring through similarity to French expressions such as "voltige", "volte-face" and "volatile". "Arouet" would not have served the purpose, given that name's associations with "[[Breaking wheel#Metaphorical uses|roué]]" and with an expression that meant "for thrashing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]], ''Sidetracks'', pp. 345–66; and "Voltaire's Grin", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', November 30, 1955, pp. 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century French author [[Marie-Henri Beyle]] used many [[pen name]]s, most famously the mononym Stendhal, adapted from the name of the little [[Prussia]]n town of [[Stendal]], birthplace of the German art historian [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], whom Stendhal admired.&lt;ref&gt;F.W.J. Hemmings, "Stendhal", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 25, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 20th century, a fourth French writer, [[Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette]] (author of ''[[Gigi]]'', 1945), used her actual surname as her mononym pen name, Colette.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Marks, "Colette", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 7, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Some French actors and singers have used their given name or surname as a stage mononym.

===Other Europe===
[[File:Franz Gareis - Novalis.jpg|thumb|Novalis]]

In the 17th and 18th centuries, most Italian [[castrato]] singers used mononyms as stage names (e.g. [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]], [[Farinelli]]). The German writer, mining engineer and philosopher, Georg Friedrich Philipp Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772–1801), became famous as [[Novalis]]. 

The 19th-century Dutch writer Eduard Douwes Dekker (1820–87), better known by his mononymous pen name [[Multatuli]] (from the [[Latin]] ''multa tuli'', "I have suffered [or ''borne''] many things"), became famous for the satirical novel, ''Max Havelaar'' (1860), in which he denounced the abuses of [[colonialism]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). In 2002 Multatuli was proclaimed by the Society for Dutch Literature to have been the most important Dutch writer of all time. 

The Dutch writer Jan Hendrik Frederik Grönloh (1882–1961) wrote under the pseudonym [[Nescio]] (Latin for "I don't know").

The 20th-century British author [[Hector Hugh Munro]] became known by his [[pen name]], Saki. In 20th-century Poland, the [[theater of the absurd|theater-of-the-absurd]] [[playwright]], novelist, [[Painting|painter]], photographer and [[History of philosophy in Poland#Twentieth century|philosopher]] [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]] after 1925 often used the mononymous pseudonym Witkacy, a [[conflation#Language|conflation]] of his surname (''Witkiewicz'') and [[middle name]] (''Ignacy'').&lt;ref&gt;"[[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkiewicz, Stanisław Ignacy]]", ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', pp. 747–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of visual artists, such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rembrandt]], are commonly known by mononyms. The modern Russian artist [[Erté]] formed his mononymous [[pseudonym]] from the initials of his actual name, as did the Belgian comics writers [[Hergé]] and [[Jijé]].

Italian painter [[Bernardo Bellotto]], who is now ranked as an important and original painter in his own right, traded on the mononymous pseudonym of his uncle and teacher, Antonio Canal ([[Canaletto]]), in those countries—Poland and Germany—where his famous uncle was not active, calling himself likewise "Canaletto". Bellotto remains commonly known as "Canaletto" in those countries to this day.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Bernardo Bellotto|Bellotto, Bernardo]]", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 3, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mononymity was represented in [[photography]], from that art's infancy, by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] (Gaspard-Félix Tournachon).

===North America===
The American writer of non-fiction and fiction, [[Rodney William Whitaker]] (1931–2005), is best known for some novels that he wrote under the mononym [[pen name]], Trevanian. The Armenian-Canadian [[portrait photographer]] [[Yousuf Karsh]] was commonly known as "Karsh of [[Ottawa]]".

==Royalty==
[[File:Emperor Akihito cropped Akihito 090710-1600b.jpg|thumb|[[Akihito]], [[Emperor of Japan]]]]

[[Monarch]]s and other [[Royal family|royalty]], for example [[Napoleon]], have traditionally availed themselves of the [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] of using a mononym, modified when necessary by an [[regnal number|ordinal]] or [[epithet]] (e.g., Queen [[Elizabeth II]] or [[Charles the Great]]). This is not always the case: King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] of Sweden has two names. While many European royals have formally sported [[Personal names#Feudal names|long chains]] of names, in practice they have tended to use only one or two and not to use [[surname]]s.{{efn|The names of a few European kings ''have'' included surname&amp;nbsp;— for example, those of most of Poland's [[Monarchs of Poland|elected kings]], such as [[Stefan Batory|Stefan ''Batory'']].&lt;ref&gt;"Stephen Báthory", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 3, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In Japan, the emperor and his family have no surname, only a given name, such as [[Hirohito]], which in practice in Japanese is rarely used: out of respect and as a measure of politeness, Japanese prefer to say "the Emperor" or "the Crown Prince".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wetzler, ''Hirohito and War: Imperial Tradition and Military Decision-Making in Prewar Japan'', preface, University of Hawaii Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8248-1166-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following an Emperor's death or retirement, he is renamed according to the era of his reign. In India, the first six [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors were known by just one name, adopted by each emperor upon his accession.

[[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]]s have traditionally adopted a single, [[regnal name]] upon their [[List of papal elections|election]] (except for [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] and [[Pope John Paul II|II]]). The mononymous tradition reverted to form with the election and succession of Pope [[Benedict XVI]] in 2005 and [[Pope Francis]] in 2013.

==Modern times==

===Mononym-normal===
The Western practice of combining a given name (Christian name or [[given name|forename]]) with a family name ([[surname]]) is not universal.

Surnames were introduced in [[Turkey]] only after [[World War I]], by that country's first president, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], as part of his westernizing and modernizing program.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Siwmir, "''Nieziemska ziemia''" ("An Unearthly Land"), ''[[Gwiazda Polarna]]'' [The Pole Star]: ''America's oldest independent Polish-language newspaper'', Stevens Point, Wisconsin, vol. 100, no 18, August 29, 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  His own surname, Atatürk, which was bestowed by the Turkish parliament, means "Father Turk". Common people can be addressed semi-formally by their given name plus the title [[Bey]] or [[Khanum|Hanım]] (without surname), whereas politicians are often known by surname only ([[Bülent Ecevit|Ecevit]], [[Süleyman Demirel|Demirel]]). Many Turkish sportspeople, especially football players, wear jerseys with only their first name.

Mononyms are also common in Indonesia for [[Javanese name|Javanese individual]]s, both prominent government figures such as former presidents [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]] and commoners such as [[Triyatno]].

Most Icelanders do not have surnames, only [[patronymics]] (sometimes [[matronymic]]s), and they address each other by given name, even in formal situations.

===Asia===
In modern times, in countries that have long been part of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] (Japan, [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]] and China itself), mononyms are rare. An exception pertains to the [[Emperor of Japan]] (a common opinion being that there is no state{{huh|date=September 2018}} to give the [[Japanese name|family name]] ({{lang|ja|苗字}}) to the Emperor). 

Mononyms are common as [[stage name]]s in the [[entertainment industry]], usually when the performer's legal name is not publicly known; e.g., [[Ayaka]], [[Becky (television personality)|Becky]], [[Gackt]], [[Hide (musician)|hide]], [[Hyde (musician)|Hyde]], [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]], [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]], [[Miyavi]], [[Tsunku]], and [[Yui (singer)|Yui]]. Also, Japanese baseball star [[Ichiro Suzuki]] is widely known in both Japan and North America as "Ichiro". In [[Hong Kong]], a few musicians are also known by mononyms, e.g., [[Janice Vidal|Janice]],&lt;ref name="CDbook"&gt;All Janice Vidal albums are credited mononymously as "Janice".{{Cite book

Mononyms continue to be used in parts of India, especially the South. [[Mayawati]], former [[Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh|Chief Minister]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], chooses to use only a single name. Several Indian film personalities, such as [[Asin]], [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]], [[Rekha]], [[Kajol]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Rajnikanth]], and [[Pran (actor)|Pran]],  are also mononymous. [[Govindjee]], Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Plant Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an Indian-American and an authority on photosynthesis, publishes his research under his singular name. In the northeastern India state of Mizoram, most people have a single name, mostly of three syllables (e.g., Lalthansanga, Thangrikhuma, Zorinmawia).  Everyone also has a tribal or clan name inherited from their father, but they do not include it in their official name.

Mononyms are also common in [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Javanese name]]s. In some cases, such as those of former Presidents [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]], the mononym is the full legal name. Other mononyms, such as [[Rossa (singer)|Rossa]], [[Chrisye]] and [[Tohpati]], are stage names taken from a nickname or are part of the full name.

Single names still also occur in [[Tibet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4607454.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tibets most famous woman blogger Woeser detained by police | first=Jane | last=MacArtney | date=August 26, 2008 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mongolia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Most [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] have no [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Public Radio]] report of 18 May 2009 about civilian Afghan victims of U.S. [[Drone aircraft|drone-aircraft]] bombings in the U.S.-[[Taliban]] war.

In [[Thailand]], people usually address each other in informal situations by nicknames ({{lang-th|ชึ่อเล่น|translit=chue-len}}). Given by parents or relatives in early childhood, these nicknames are typically one syllable (or worn down from two syllables to one). They may often be nonsense words or humorous, and usually have no relation to the person's actual name, although in some cases may be diminutive forms of their first name, like "Nok" for "Noknoi" which means respectively bird and little bird, the first used as nickname and the second being the first name. All Thais have such a name, even the [[Thai royal family|royal family]], and they are freely used in everyday life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Mononyms are common in [[Myanmar]]. [[U Thant]], a Myanmar diplomat, was the third [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] (1961–71).  "U" is an honorific in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], roughly equal to "Mr". "''Thant''" was his only name, per local convention. In Myanmar, he was known as ''Pantanaw U Thant'', in reference to his hometown, [[Pantanaw]].

In the [[Near East]]'s [[Arab]] world, the Syrian poet Ali Ahmad Said Esber (born 1930) at age 17 adopted the mononym pseudonym, [[Adunis]], sometimes also spelled "Adonis".  A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in literature, he has been described as the greatest living poet of the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jan/27/adonis-syrian-poet-life-in-writing|title=Adonis: a life in writing|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=27 January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012|quote=each autumn is credibly tipped for the Nobel in literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The West===
In the West, mononymity, as well as its use by royals in conjunction with titles, has been primarily a privilege of [[celebrity|famous]] persons such as prominent writers, [[artist]]s, [[entertainer]]s, musicians and [[athlete]]s.{{efn|"A mononym is a name consisting of a single word. They are generally favored by celebrities of sufficient stature to be identified in this way, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Pelé]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/mononym] "Mononym", on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|A [[Paris Hilton]] [[lookalike]], [[Chantelle Houghton]], nicknamed "[[Paris Travelodge]]", became famous "for not being famous" after winning an extraordinary ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Lucy Rock writes: "It is a select band. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]], [[Pelé]], [[Thalía]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]... even, possibly, [[Katie Price|Jordan]].&lt;!--She now uses her real name.--&gt; People who wear their fame with such confidence that they have dispensed with the... concerns of having more than one name. They are the '''mononym brigade'''. Now there is one more.... Chantelle is... the apotheosis of that celebrity narrative that first gave us people who were famous for being good at something. Then came the people who were famous for simply... being famous. Now there is Chantelle, who is famous for not being famous at all."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Rock, "From Nobody Much to Someone Special", ''[[The Observer]]'', January 29, 2006 [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/29/broadcasting.bigbrother]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some persons, such as the artists [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent]] and [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]], the sculptor [[Chryssa]], and the singer-songwriter [[Basia]], have had polynymous names that were unwieldy, or unfamiliar and difficult to remember or to pronounce in the community in which they were currently active, but have not wanted to entirely change their names to something more familiar to the broad public at the cost of abandoning their sense of [[self-identification]], and so have used only a single part of their full names.

The case of the Icelandic musician [[Björk]] is similar, but her use of a single name also has roots in her native culture. Like most Icelanders, she [[Icelandic name|has no family name]]; the second part of her full name is a patronymic.  In her case, ''Björk Guðmundsdóttir'' literally translates to "''Björk, Guðmund's daughter''". Icelanders generally address one another solely by given names even in formal settings.

Some mononym stage names are the performer's [[given name]] (e.g., [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], [[Zendaya]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[Selena]], [[Cher]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyoncé]]) while others may be the performer's [[middle name]] (e.g., [[Rihanna]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), or [[surname]] (e.g. [[Liberace]], [[Mantovani]], [[Morrissey]]). Some mononym stage names are invented (e.g.  [[Eminem]], [[P!nk]], [[Lorde]]), adopted words (e.g. [[Capucine]], French for "[[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]]") or nicknames (e.g., [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Bono]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]).

In [[Lusophone]] countries such as [[Portugal]], [[Cape Verde]] and especially [[Brazil]], football players often adopt a mononym (e.g. [[Pelé]], [[Nani]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Eusébio]], [[Marta (footballer)|Marta]]&lt;!-- four examples (2 x nicknames + 2 x given names) is plenty - please discuss on the talk page before changing the examples used - thanks --&gt;). In Spain, mononyms for football players are also very common; they include the player's first name ([[Xavi]], [[Sergi Barjuán|Sergi]], [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]]), derivations of the player's surname ([[Ferran Corominas|Coro]], [[Guti (footballer)|Guti]]), derivations of the player's first name ([[Juanfran (footballer, born 1985)|Juanfran]], [[Kiko (Spanish footballer)|Kiko]]), diminutives ([[Juanito (footballer, born 1976)|Juanito]], [[Mista (footballer)|Mista]]), and nicknames ([[Míchel (footballer)|Michel]], [[Arteaga (footballer)|Arteaga]], [[Arzu (footballer)|Arzu]]). Because there are a few very common surnames in Spain (García, Pérez, López, Hernández), the use of mononyms makes it easier to distinguish between the many Garcías and Pérezes on each team. Mononyms are occasionally used by players from other countries, for example the [[Venezuela]]n [[Miku (footballer)|Miku]], the [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] [[Gervinho]] and the [[Serbia]]n-born [[United States|American]] [[Preki]]. Mononyms can be seen in other sports in these countries, with examples including Brazilian basketball players [[Hortência Marcari|Hortência]] and [[Nenê]].

Also in Brazil, former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] is known as "Lula", a nickname he officially added to his full name. Such mononyms, which take their origin in [[given name]]s, [[surname]]s or [[nickname]]s, are used because [[Portuguese names]] tend to be rather long.

The [[comedian]] and [[illusionist]] [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], the silent half of the duo [[Penn &amp; Teller]], has legally changed his original polynym, Raymond Joseph Teller, to the mononym "Teller" and possesses a [[United States passport]] issued in that single name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/home/2007-11-15-teller-at-home_N.htm|title=At home: Teller's magical Vegas retreat speaks volumes|work=[[USA Today]]|author=della Cava, Marco R.|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/04/12/penn-and-teller-gerard-bakardy-rose-shadows-trick/|title=Penn &amp; Teller: Rogue Magician Is EXPOSING Our Secrets!!!|publisher=[[TMZ.com]]|date=2012-04-12|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional wrestler [[The Ultimate Warrior|Warrior]] (born James Hellwig) legally changed his name to the mononym "Warrior" in an effort to boost his standing in a trademark dispute with his employer, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]. His children now use the Warrior name (as opposed to Hellwig) as their surname. [[Chyna]] did likewise when the [[World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|now-WWE]] attempted to restrict her use of the name in pornographic titles; reports conflict as to whether she changed it back to her birth name, Joan Laurer, before she died.

Some have selected their mononym themselves, when they have been able to do so, because of its distinctiveness.  Others have come to be known by a mononym that has been applied to them by some segment of the public. [[Oprah Winfrey]], famed American talk show host, is usually referred to by only her first name, Oprah. The public has referred to President [[George W. Bush]] by the mononym "Dubya" ([[eye dialect]] of "W"), to distinguish from his father, President [[George H.W. Bush|George (H.W.) Bush]].

Both mechanisms contributed in the case of [[Hillary Clinton]], who has been called, and has publicly called herself, "Hillary". [[Peter Funt]], of ''[[Candid Camera]]'', wrote in a February 21, 2007 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[op-ed]] piece, "The Mononym Platform": "Someone has apparently decided that Mrs. Clinton will be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when [[Dwight Eisenhower|Ike's]] P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker. ... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/opinion/21funt.html The Mononym Platform] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in [[Salon.com]], the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as "Hillary" (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband, President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/18/hillary_interview|title=Hillary's hard-won experience
|author=Walter Shapiro|publisher=Salon.com|date=Jun 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mononyms also exist in modern popular culture. For instance, some characters on the [[NBC]] television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' are referred to only by their last names as a mononym, most prominently: [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]], played by [[Michael Richards]], and [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], played by [[Wayne Knight]]. Newman's name is clearly a true mononym, in that his first name (or possibly last name) is never used or even revealed. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, is revealed to the other characters and the audience, and so his name could be seen as less of a mononym. However, this does not occur until the show's sixth season, and after the revelation he is still referred to as Kramer.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Switch (Seinfeld)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} Additionally, on the [[ABC Studios|ABC]] television sitcom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Home Improvement'']], the character Wilson, played by [[Earl Hindman]], a next-door neighbor of the central characters, is only referred to as Wilson. His full name, Wilson Wilson, is not revealed until the fourth season.

The '''musicians of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]''' all perished when the ship sank in 1912. They played music, intending to calm the passengers, for as long as they possibly could, and all went down with the ship. All were recognized for their heroism.

==Timeline==
The ship's eight musicians - members of a three-piece ensemble and a five-piece ensemble - were booked through [[C.W. &amp; F.N. Black]], in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Band That Played On: The Extraordinary Story of the 8 Musicians Who Went Down with the Titanic|
author= Turner, Steve |date=2011|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=9781595552198|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9651636-the-band-that-played-on}}&lt;/ref&gt; They boarded at [[Southampton]] and traveled as second-class passengers.  They were not on the [[White Star Line]]'s payroll but were contracted to White Star by the Liverpool firm of C.W. &amp; F.N. Black, who placed musicians on almost all British liners. Until the night of the sinking, the players performed as two separate groups: a [[quintet]] led by violinist and official bandleader [[Wallace Hartley]], that played at teatime, after-dinner concerts, and Sunday services, among other occasions; and the violin, cello, and piano trio of [[Georges Alexandré Krins|Georges Krins]], [[Roger Marie Bricoux|Roger Bricoux]], and [[Theodore Ronald Brailey|Theodore Brailey]], that played at the À La Carte Restaurant and the Café Parisien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_band.shtml/ |title=Titanic's Band or Orchestra|website=Titanic-Titanic.com| accessdate=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Titanic'' hit an iceberg and began to sink, Hartley and his fellow band members started playing music to help keep the passengers calm as the crew loaded the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s. Many of the survivors said that Hartley and the band continued to play until the very end. One second-class passenger said: {{quotation|Many brave things were done that night, but none were more brave than those done by men playing minute after minute as the ship settled quietly lower and lower in the sea. The music they played served alike as their own immortal requiem and their right to be recalled on the scrolls of undying fame.&lt;ref name="Valiant Musicians"/&gt;}}

He first studied at Academie de Musique de Spa. He then moved to the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in [[Liège]], Belgium, where he studied from 30 October 1902 until 1908, when he won first prize for [[violin]], with the highest distinction.&lt;ref name="The Brave Bandsmen

The '''name-letter effect''' is the tendency of people to prefer the [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] in their [[personal name|name]] over other letters in the [[alphabet]]. Whether [[Human subject research|subjects]] are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.

Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian [[psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]], the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for [[initial]]s, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both [[given name|given]] and [[surname|family names]] still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.

Most people [[self-esteem|like themselves]]; the name is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who [[self-hatred|do not like themselves]] tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to [[birthday]]s: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as [[mere-exposure effect|frequent exposure]] and early mastery, have been ruled out. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor [[brand]]s matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to [[disaster relief]] following [[hurricane]]s with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.

== Background ==
Systematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with [[brand preference|brand-preference]] studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s for use in package labels.{{sfn|Mecherikoff|Horton|1959||p=114}} In an extension of the studies, [[Human subject research|subjects]] were asked to rank the [[English alphabet]] by the pleasantness of the appearance of [[letter case|capital letter]]s. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the [[coefficient of concordance|coefficients of concordance]] were low),{{sfn|Horton|Mecherikoff|1960|p=253}} a strong [[positive correlation]] was found between a letter's average rank and how [[frequency of letters|frequently]] it occurred as an initial letter of family names.{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|pp=124–125}}

[[Robert Zajonc]], a [[social psychologist]], published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of [[word]]s (e.g. "on" or "off"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|pp=6–7}} Zajonc also tested preferences for [[nonsense word]]s and found that people liked them the more they heard them.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=24}} He interpreted these results as evidence that [[mere exposure effect|mere repeated exposure]] to a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}

Around 1977, Belgian [[experimental psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]] was driving on a highway looking at [[license plate]]s when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a "mere belongingness" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

== First study ==
In his lab at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], Nuttin [[Design of experiments|designed experiments]] to test the [[hypothesis]] that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}} It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

To find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a [[yoked control design]] in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–355}}

For example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–356}}

In the first trial, 38 [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] local [[primary school|elementary school]] girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=357}} No [[significant difference]] was found using family name rather than first name or both names.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent [[data analysis]] revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}}

=== Discussion ===
Nuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, [[psychoacoustics|acoustical]], [[applied aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[semantics|semantic]], and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} He framed the effect in the context of [[narcissism]], [[Gestalt theory]] and [[awareness]], as reflected in the title of his 1985 article "Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect", in which "beyond Gestalt" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and "beyond awareness" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=358–359}} Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}

== Second study ==
In 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}}{{sfn|Sas|1986}} Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying [[affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=384}}

=== Method ===
Cross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (the only one with a non-[[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=385–386}}

=== Discussion ===
Across languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=390}} The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=391}} There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=392}}

Nuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for [[Magyarország]]). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=396–397}}

The data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=397}}

As in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=397–398}} This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=398}}{{efn-ua|This asymmetry is similar to what Czapiński found when analyzing school-trip companion preferences: much consensus as to who were the three least preferred students, but little in who were the three most preferred.{{sfn|Czapiński|1980|p=203}}}}

== Reception ==
In the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the [[European Association of Social Psychology|European Association of Experimental Social Psychology]] in 1984,{{sfn|Nuttin|1984}} followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect "so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an [[artifact (error)|artifact]]".{{sfn|Loosen|1990|p=11}}{{efn-ua|Loosen's critique stemmed from misinterpreting Nuttin's experimental design. Loosen thought that subjects in the yoked experiments were randomly selected to form a pair. However, this had not been the case. Nuttin had selected pairs based on minimal overlap of syllables in the subjects' names.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}}} Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was [[spurious relationship|spurious]], but they doubted its psychological relevance.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university ([[Ohio State University]], where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Johnson|1986}}{{efn-ua|Because the effect is most profound for initials, Johnson had christened the effect the ''initial-letter effect''. Nuttin did not agree with this [[reductionism]], saying there is no need to create the illusion of two phenomena where there is only one.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=396}}}}

This all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=11}} After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called "seminal" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}} Their meta-analysis found no trace of [[publication bias]].{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|pp=66–67}}

== Characteristics ==
In her 2014 [[meta-analysis]] of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} She noted robustness in:

* Scope: The name-letter effect is stronger for initials than for non-initials, but generally still holds even when excluding initials from analysis.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua| Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis found an effect only for initials, not for letters in other positions.{{sfn|Koole|Smeets|van Knippenberg|Dijksterhuis|1999|p=111}}}}
* Gender: All but two studies found the effect equally strong for women and men.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The exceptions are a study by Albers, Rotteveel, and Dijksterhuis, and one by Stieger, Preyss, and Voracek.{{sfn|Albers|Rotteveel|Dijksterhuis|2009|p=63}}{{sfn|Stieger|Preyss|Voracek|2012|p=51}}}}{{efn-ua|Gender-role orientation, the extent to which an individual adopts and displays traits, attitudes, and behaviors normatively identified as male-typical or female-typical, may also play a part in the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014|p=358}} It can be measured by the gender initial-preference task, which requires participants to rate letters for their gender typicality. Men have been shown to rate their initial letters as more male-typical, whereas women rate their initials as more female-typical.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014}}}}
* Age: The effect has been found in people ranging from school children to university students, middle-aged and old-aged adults.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The only known exception is a study by Kernis, Lakey, and Heppner.{{sfn|Kernis|Lakey|Heppner|2008|p=477}}}}
* Culture: Although there are many differences between [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western cultures]], including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the [[Thai name|family name]] is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=204}} Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for [[Japanese name|initials in Japan]], where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}
* Language: 15 languages have been tested ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, [[Thai language|Thai]]), covering four language families  ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Japonic]]) and five alphabets ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]], Roman, [[Cyrillic]], [[Devanagari]], [[Kana]]). In all cases a name-letter effect was found.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=184}}
* Time: In a study on preferences for initials, Stieger and LeBel found that people who had [[Maiden and married names|changed their name after marrying]] continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.{{sfn|Stieger|LeBel|2012|p=10}}

== Explanations ==
Various explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.

=== Disproved causes ===

==== Mere exposure ====
People may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and [[phoneme]]s and how attractive they were judged to be.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|Forer|1940|p=589}}{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|p=123}} Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it.{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{efn-ua|Nuttin made the assumption that for any given letter, total exposure has been roughly the same for each subject. That is, an adult's name is read or written infrequently compared to all other words.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} Other researchers agreed; Greenwald and Banaji spoke of "reaching an asymptote".{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=399}} In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=398–400}}

==== Subjective frequency ====
Subjective frequency is how frequently subjects {{em|think}} a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the {{em|actual}} frequency was identical.{{sfn|Matlin|1971|p=295}} Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}} The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}}

==== Evaluative conditioning ====
[[Evaluative conditioning]] suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of [[classical conditioning]] in which we come to like or dislike something through an association.{{sfn|Martin|Levey|1987|p=69}} Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the [[cocktail party effect]], it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}{{sfn|Mack|Rock|1998|p=18}} Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese [[kanji]]) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}

==== Subjective ownership ====
Subjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.{{sfn|Hoorens|1990|p=29}}

==== Mastery pleasure ====
The letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name,{{sfn|Treiman|Broderick|1998|p=112}} may come to have lasting positive associations.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their [[first language|mother tongue]] alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=365}} Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}{{efn-ua|The effect was not due to the two alphabets sharing letters. It was found for common letters with identical pronunciation (AEKMT), common letters with different pronunciation (BCFPYU), and Roman capitals not appearing in Cyrillic (DFGIJNRVWZ).{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}}} The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=368}} In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=190}}{{efn-ua|Other studies have since also found the effect to increase over age, for instance, Corenblum and Armstrong in their study of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Native Canadian]] children.{{sfn|Corenblum|Armstrong|2012|p=130}}}} They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later.{{efn-ua|Only Thai [[consonant]]s were presented as stimuli. Thai [[vowel]]s can not be used in isolation as their sound depends on their context.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=192}}}} They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=196–201}}

=== Probable cause ===
The effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}}

==== Mere ownership ====
Nuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in [[behavioral economics|economic psychology]]. The [[endowment effect]] has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.{{sfn|Kahneman|Knetsch|Thaler|1991|p=193}}{{sfn|Beggan|1992|p=229}} Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general [[mere ownership effect|mere-ownership effect]].{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.

* Most people should like their name. Those that do not should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name relatively highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|pp=177–200}}
* Bilinguals using two different alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should be found in the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}} This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=183–184}}
* Similar effects should be found for other attributes connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}} In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong [[birthday-number effect]] for the day of the month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}

==== Implicit self-esteem ====
Another group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of [[social psychology]], specifically the [[self-esteem]] theory. Beginning with [[Anthony Greenwald|Greenwald]] and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from [[implicit self-esteem]], a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}} Most people like themselves.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}} As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin.{{sfn|Syz|1926|pp=119–126}} It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|p=108}}

* To be an automatic process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, [[Ap Dijksterhuis|Dijksterhuis]] and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each letter of the alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change between the first and second rating.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=672–673}} Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.{{sfn|Hoorens|Takano|Franck|Roberts|2015|p=910}}
* To be an automatic process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, be influenced by deliberate thought. Multiple studies have shown that thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=673}}{{sfn|Wilson|Dunn|Kraft|Lisle|1989|p=330}} Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of an automatic process.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=674–676}}
* Unconscious [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]] has been found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency.{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}} Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.{{sfn|Komori|Murata|2008|p=109}}
* If the effect is an automatic process, then the subliminal use of name letters should influence other preferences. Wentura, Kulfanek, and Greve investigated this by the use of a [[priming (psychology)|priming]] technique. They showed subjects the first and last initials of their own name or of a yoked subject's name, too briefly to be noticed. This was immediately followed by words such as "honest" and "lonely". Subjects had to quickly identify the word they had seen as positive or negative. It was found that subjects categorized positive words more quickly if they were first primed with their own initials. There was no effect for negative words. The effects of initial-letter priming were especially strong for subjects with high levels of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Wentura|Kulfanek|Greve|2001|p=657}}{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|pp=101–102}}
* If there is a halo effect spreading to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.{{sfn|LeBel|Campbell|2009|p=1293}} DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Fiedorowicz|Carvallo|2011|p=127}}

== Application ==
In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=64}} There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}} Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}}

The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=233}} There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the [[Likert scale|rating scales]] (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}

There is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm (the so-called "I-algorithm"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=101}}).{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, [[content validity|validity]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=244}} The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=248}} The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[physical health]], [[social acceptance]], [[unrealistic optimism]], feedback sensitivity, [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], and [[defensiveness]].{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=86}}

== Wider implications ==
Researchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.

=== In the lab ===
In controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1099}}&amp;nbsp;The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like&amp;nbsp;Honda&amp;nbsp;more than non-matching brands).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1108}}&amp;nbsp;They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things.{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1109}}&amp;nbsp;Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1089}}&amp;nbsp;The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1095}}

Wiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the&amp;nbsp;[[personal pronoun]]s&amp;nbsp;"I" and "my" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. [[iPhone]], [[Myspace]]) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g.&amp;nbsp;[[Xbox]]). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.{{sfn|Wiebenga|Fennis|2012|p=733}}

A study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of&amp;nbsp;[[undergraduate]]&amp;nbsp;students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.{{sfn|Polman|Pollmann|Poehlman|2013}}

=== Outside the lab ===
==== Controversial studies ====
Researchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&amp;nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p=665}} &amp;nbsp;Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}}

Simonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters "Den" compared to with "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more "Den" dentists than "Wal" than implicit egotism.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=22–23}}&amp;nbsp;Using both a different data set ([[Twitter]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Google+]]&amp;nbsp;accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.{{sfn| Kooti|Magno|Weber|2014|p=216}}{{efn-ua|Overlooking a cohort confound was also the problem with controversial research that tied initials to death. Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive [[monogram]]s (e.g. ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g. PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999|p=241}} Morrison and Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artefact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. When they grouped the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005|p=820}} Similarly, Smith found statistical errors had led Abel and Kruger wrongly to conclude that [[Major League Baseball]] players whose names have positive initials live longer than players with negative initials.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=211}}{{sfn|Abel|Kruger|2007|p=179}}}}

Dyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 "Saint cities" in the US, such as&amp;nbsp;[[St. Louis]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used&amp;nbsp;[[Bayesian network|Bayesian hierarchical modelling]]&amp;nbsp;to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=7–10}}&amp;nbsp;A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as&amp;nbsp;[[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=8–9}} Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=15}}

Simonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.{{sfn|Anseel|Duyck|2008|p=1059}}&amp;nbsp;But Simonsohn suspected that, like&amp;nbsp;[[Walt Disney]] working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=1087}}

A few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players [[strikeout|striking out]] (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams |2010|p=881}}{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}} Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] than others with initials A or B.{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}}&amp;nbsp;Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams|2011|p=340}}

In response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the&amp;nbsp;''[[New Scientist]]''&amp;nbsp;has coined&amp;nbsp;[[nominative determinism]].{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994}} Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were [[metalsmith|smiths]]. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

==== Undisputed studies ====
[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Satellite image of a hurricane|upright|[[Hurricane Katrina]]: people with the initial K especially donated to the disaster relief.]]
Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]]). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.{{sfn|Chandler|Griffin|Sorensen|2008|pp=404–410}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|pp=44–45}}&amp;nbsp;Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=46}}

[[File:Navneforandring.jpg|thumb|right|Name change certificate issued by Christian X of Denmark in 1917]]
'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days.

The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

[[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme can be seen on the top left.]]

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

==Legendary origin==

The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
*[[Battle of Bouvines|Bouvines 1214]]
*[[Seventh Crusade|Seventh Crusade 1248]]
*[[Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle|Mons-en-Pévèle 1304]]
*[[Battle of Crécy|Crécy 1346]]
*[[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers 1356]]
*[[Battle of Roosebeke|Roosebeke 1382]]
*[[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt 1415]]

The Oriflamme was lost at least five times during its medieval history; Mons-en-Pévèle,&lt;ref&gt;DeVries, Kelly (2006) : ''Infantry Warfare in the Early Fourteenth Century''. Woodbridge, UK: Boydell Press, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; Crécy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trial by Battle |last=Sumption |first= Jonathon|year=1990|publisher= Faber &amp; Faber|location=London |isbn=0-571-20095-8 |page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poitiers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Green | title=The Battle of Poitiers 1356 | publisher= | location= | year=2004 | isbn=0-7524-2557-9|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Agincourt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Agincourt|last=Barker |first=Juliet |authorlink=Juliet Barker |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=London |isbn=0316726486 |page=288 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also during the campaigns of the [[Seventh Crusade]] under [[King Louis IX]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5ry8BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT47&amp;lpg=PT47&amp;dq=oriflamme+lost+at+crecy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pI5Vxrq898&amp;sig=c1k1MERjD9ECAMD1WfoIvaA_Rb4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBWoVChMI493i9t6MxwIVAuFyCh1J-gGR#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20lost%20at%20crecy&amp;f=false Edward Cowan (2012) '' The Wallace Book'', Birlinn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.baronage.co.uk/bphtm-02/moa-15a.html|title= The Oriflamme|date=2000|publisher=The Baronage Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}

*[[Geoffroi de Charny]] - 14th-century [[knight]] and author of several works on [[chivalry]].  He first bore the Oriflamme during the failed attempt to relieve Calais in 1347&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathon | last = Sumption |title=Trial by Fire |publisher=faber &amp; faber | year=2001 | isbn=0-571-20737-5 | page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and died at [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] defending it.&lt;ref&gt;Green (2004), p.56&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Arnoul d'Audrehem]] - 14th-century former [[Marshal of France]].  He held the office from 1368 to his death in 1370 but never carried the banner in action.
*[[Guillaume de Martel]] - Seigneur de [[Bacqueville]]. He carried the Oriflamme at Agincourt and died there.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), p.323&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Oriflamme in literature ==
The 19th-century poet [[Robert Southey]] refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem ''Joan of Arc''{{cquote|
:::::"Dark-minded man!"
:The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
:Brings with itself an ample recompense.
:I have not reared the oriflamme of death —
:Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
:Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
:Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
:To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
:Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
:To England friendly as to all the world;
:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."

'''Papal coats of arms''' are the personal [[coat of arms]] of [[pope]]s of the [[Catholic Church]]. These have been a tradition since the [[Late Middle Ages]], and has displayed his own, initially that of his family, and thus not unique to himself alone, but in some cases composed by him with symbols referring to his past or his aspirations.&lt;ref name=BXVI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1piMMqjAf1MC&amp;pg=PA496 Christoph F.

Even before the [[early modern period]], a man who did not have a family coat of arms would assume one upon becoming a bishop, as men did when knighted&lt;ref name="books.google.ie"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s4RZnW-B0-wC&amp;pg=PA342 David Brewster, ''The Edinburgh Encyclopædia'' (Routledge 1999] {{ISBN|978-0-41518026-9}}), vol. 1, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; or on achieving some other prominence.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] (1364 – c. 1430), [https://books.google.com/books?id=epXQh7B1w20C&amp;pg=PA216 ''The Book of Deeds of Arms and of Chivalry'' (English translation: Penn State Press 1999] {{ISBN|9780271043050}}, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Some who already had an episcopal coat of arms altered it on being elected to the papal throne.&lt;ref name=BXVI/&gt; The last pope who was elected without already being a bishop was [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1831 and the last who was not even a priest when elected was [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513.&lt;ref name="religionnews.com"&gt;[http://www.religionnews.com/2013/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-popes-and-conclaves/ Religion News Service, "Popes and conclaves: everything you need to know"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==External ornaments==
[[File:Wernigeroder Wappenbuch 022.jpg|thumb|Arms of [[Innocent VIII]] (Giovanni Battista Cybo, 1484-1492) as shown in the contemporary  [[Wernigerode Armorial]]. The coat of arms of the House of Cybo is here shown with the papal tiara and two keys ''argent'' in one of the earliest examples of these external ornaments of a papal coat of arms ([[Pope Nicholas V]] in 1447 was the first to adopt two silver keys as the charges of his adopted coat of arms).&lt;ref name=Collenberg693/&gt;]]

Papal coats of arms are traditionally shown with an image of the [[papal tiara]] and the [[keys of Peter]] as an external ornament of the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]. The tiara is usually set above the escutcheon, while the keys are in saltire, passing behind it (formerly also ''en cimier'', below the tiara and above the shield). In modern times, the dexter and sinister keys are usually shown in gold ([[or (heraldry)|or]]) and silver ([[argent]]), respectively. The first depiction of a tiara, still with a single coronet, in connection with papal arms, is on the tomb of [[Pope Boniface VIII|Boniface VIII]] (d. 1303) in the basilica of S. John Lateran.&lt;ref name="p. 151"&gt;John Woodward, ''A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry'', 1894, [https://archive.org/stream/atreatiseoneccl00woodgoog#page/n246/mode/2up p. 151].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] in 2005 deviated from tradition in replacing the tiara with the [[mitre]] and [[pallium]] (see [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI]]).

The two keys have been given the interpretation of representing the  power to bind and to loose on earth (silver) and in heaven (gold), in reference to {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:18-19|ESV}}:
:"You are [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
The gold key signifies that the power reaches to heaven and the silver key that it extends to all the faithful on earth, the interlacing indicating the linking between the two aspects of the power, and the arrangement with the handles of the keys at the base symbolizes that the power is in the hands of the pope.&lt;ref name="Heaven p. 54"&gt;"The symbolism of the keys is brought out in an ingenious and interpretative fashion by heraldic art. One of the keys is of gold , the other of silver. The golden key, which points upwards on the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] side, signifies the power that extends even to Heaven. The silver key, which must point up to the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] side, symbolizes the power over all the faithful on earth. The two are often linked by a cordon [[Gules (heraldry)|Gules]] as a sign of the union of the two powers. The handles are turned downwards, for they are in the hand of the Pope, Christ's lieutenant on earth. The wards point upwards, for the power of binding and loosing engages Heaven itself." Bruno Bernhard Heim, ''Heraldry in the Catholic Church: Its Origin, Customs and Laws'' (Van Duren 1978 {{ISBN|9780391008731}}), p. 54)&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known representation of the crossed keys beneath the papal tiara in the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|Coats of arms of the Holy See]] dates from the time of [[Pope Martin V]] (1417–1431).  His successor [[Pope Eugene IV]] (1431–1447) included it in the design of a silver coin.&lt;ref name=Ceresa&gt;[http://www.lucisullest.it/dett_news_print.php?id=3823 Claudio Ceresa, "Una sintesi di simboli ispirati alla Scrittura" on ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', 10 August 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130218091006/http://www.lucisullest.it/dett_news_print.php?id=3823 |date=18 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Martin V also included the keys in his personal arms (those of the [[Colonna family]]); however he did not show them as external ornaments, instead placing them [[Chief (heraldry)|in chief]] on the shield (this example was followed by Urban V and VIII and Alexander VII; Nicolas V seems to have used just the crossed keys and the tiara in an escutcheon. The placing of the keys above the shield becomes the fashion in the early 16th century, so shown on the tomb of [[Pope Pius III|Pius III]] (d. 1503). [[Pope Adrian VI|Adrian VI]] (1522/3) placed the keys in saltire behind the shield.&lt;ref name="Woodward153"&gt;John Woodward, ''A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry'', 1894, [https://archive.org/stream/atreatiseoneccl00woodgoog#page/n248/mode/2up p. 153f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Middle Ages==
[[File:A03 ADRIANO IV.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Adrian IV]] (d. 1159, born Nicholas Breakspear, the only Englishman to occupy the papal throne) did not use a personal coat of arms; Nevertheless, he was given attributed arms (showing a broken spear) in this 17th-century portrait.]]
[[Heraldry]] developed out of military insignia from the time of the [[First Crusade]]. 

The first papal coats of arms appeared when heraldry began to be codified in the 12th to 13th centuries. 
At first, the popes simply used the secular coat of arms of their family. 
Thus, [[Pope Innocent IV]] (1243-1254), who was born Sinibaldo Fieschi, presumably used the Fieschi coat of arms, as did [[Adrian V]] (Ottobon de Fieschi), the nephew of Innocent IV.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
According to Michel Pastoureau, [[Pope Innocent IV]] (1243-1254) is likely the first who displayed personal arms, but the first of whom a contemporary coat of arms survives is [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (1294-1303).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Michel Pastoureau | title=Traité d'Héraldique | edition=3&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; édition | publisher=Picard | year=1997 | isbn=2-7084-0520-9 | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern sources show [[attributed arms]]  of the popes of the second half of the 12th century; thus, editions of the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' of the 1960s presented the arms of the popes beginning with [[Pope Innocent III]] (1198-1216),&lt;ref name="AP1969"&gt;"Stemmi dei Sommi Pontefici dal sec. XII ad oggi" in ''Annuario Pontificio 1969'' (Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, Vatican City 1969), pp. 23*-27*&lt;/ref&gt; and John Woodward gave those of the popes from [[Pope Lucius II]] (1144-1145) onward, though he noted that "it seems probably that many of the early Popes made little if any use of their family arms".&lt;ref name=Woodward/&gt;
Thus, Innocent III (Lothaire de Segni, 1160-1216) and Gregory IX (Ugolin de Segni, 1145-1241) may have used the coat of arms of the Counts of [[Segni]].&lt;ref name="heraldique-europeenne.org"&gt;So presented at [http://www.heraldique-europeenne.org/Regions/Italie/Papes_2.htm heraldique-europeenne.org] and [http://www.araldicavaticana.com/innocenzo_3.htm araldicavaticana.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following papal coat of arms should be considered ''traditional'', lacking contemporary attribution. 
For the popes of noble families, the coats of arms of the family is substituted, and for commoners, the traditional coat of arms as shown in early modern heraldic sources.

==Popes of the modern period==
The last person elected as pope who was not already an ordained priest or monk was [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (Giovanni di Lorenzo de' [[Medici]]) in 1513. Thus, throughout the Early Modern period, the elected pope already had a coat of arms: if he did not have a family coat of arms to begin with, he would have adopted one upon being made bishop. Upon his election as pope, he would continue using his pre-existing coat of arms, in some cases with [[Augmentation of honour|heraldic augmentations]]. This tradition was continued into the modern period.

When he became [[Patriarch of Venice]] in 1893, he added the chief of Venice (the [[Lion of St. Mark]]), changing the field from gules (red) to argent (white) to make the heraldic point that this was the "religious emblem of St. Mark's Lion and not the insignia [of the former Republic of Venice]". When he was elected pope in 1903, heraldists expected him to  again drop the chief of Venice, but Sarto did not change his coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Cardinal Jacques. Heraldry in the Vatican.

The dove was perched on a trimount and sitting below the arc of a rainbow, an allusion to the story of [[Noah]].

The chief containing St. Mark's lion reflects not only his own service as [[Patriarch of Venice]] (1969), but also that of John XXIII (and Pius X, who also used this chief in his own arms).  Cardinal Luciani's original arms replaced the fleurs-de-lis above the collee in his immediate predecessor's arms with four-pointed stars; when Luciani was elevated to Pope they were modified to become five-pointed stars which are a heraldic symbol of Our Lady, specifically of the Assumption.

A '''patronymic''', or '''patronym''', is a component of a [[personal name]] based on the [[given name]] of one's father, grandfather (i.e., an '''avonymic'''),&lt;ref&gt;Willy van Langendonck. 2007. ''Theory and Typology of Proper Names''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichler, Ernst et al. (eds.). 1995. ''Namenforschung''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; or an earlier male ancestor. A component of a name based on the name of one's mother or a female ancestor is a [[matronymic]]. Each is a means of conveying [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].

Patronymics are still in use, including mandatory use, in many countries worldwide, although their use has largely been replaced by or transformed into [[patronymic surname]]s. Examples of such transformations include common English surnames such as [[Johnson]] (son of John).

==Origins of terms==

The usual noun and adjective in English is ''patronymic'', but as a noun this exists in [[free variation]] alongside ''patronym''. (The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the corresponding ''metronymic'' and ''metronym'', alongside ''matronymic'' but not, however, ''matronym''.) The first part of the word ''patronym'' comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] πατήρ ''patēr'' "father" (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive case|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; πατρός ''patros'' whence the [[combining form]] πατρο- ''patro''-);&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|path/r|πατήρ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the second part comes from Greek ὄνυμα ''onyma'', a variant form of ὄνομα ''onoma'' "name".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)/noma|ὄνομα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the form ''patronymic'', this stands with the addition of the suffix [[wikt:-ικός|-ικός]] (''-ikos''), which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense ‘pertaining to’ (thus 'pertaining to the father's name'). These forms are attested in [[Hellenistic Greek]] as πατρώνυμος (''patrōnymos'') and πατρωνυμικός (''patrōnymikos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|patrw/numos|πατρώνυμος}}, {{LSJ|patrwnumiko/s|πατρωνυμικός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''patronym'', first attested in English in 1834, was borrowed into English from French ''patronyme'', which had previously borrowed the word directly from Greek. ''Patronymic'', first attested in English in 1612, has a more complex history. Both Greek words had entered Latin, and, from Latin, French. The English form ''patronymic'' was borrowed through the mutual influence of French and Latin on English.&lt;ref&gt;"patronym, n."; "patronymic, n. and adj.", ''OED Online'' (3rd edn). March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In many areas around the world, patronyms predate the use of [[family name]]s. Family names in many [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[English language|English]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]], [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] surnames originate from patronyms, e.g. [[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]] (son of [[William (name)|William]]), [[FitzGerald (surname)|FitzGerald]] (son of [[Gerald]]), [[Powell (surname)|Powell]] (from "ap [[Hywel]]"), [[Fernández]] (son of [[Fernando]]), [[Rodríguez (surname)|Rodríguez]] (son of [[Rodrigo]]), [[Anderson (surname)|Anderson]] or [[Andersen]] (son of [[Anders]], [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] form of [[Andrew (given name)|Andrew]]), [[Carlson (name)|Carlson]] or [[Carlsen (name)|Carlsen]] (son of [[Carl (name)|Carl]]), [[Ilyin]] (of [[Ilya]]), [[Petrov (surname)|Petrov]] (of [[Peter (given name)|Peter]]), [[Grigorovich]] (son of [[Grigory]], [[Russian language|Russian]] form of [[Gregory (given name)|Gregory]]), [[Stefanović]] (son of [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], little Stefan), [[MacAllister]] (from "mac Alistair", meaning son of [[Alistair]], anglicized Scottish form of [[Alexander]]) and [[O'Conor]] (from "Ó Conchobhair", meaning grandson/descendant of [[Conchobhar]]). Other cultures which formerly used patronyms have switched to the more widespread style of passing the father's last name to the children (and wife) as their own.
In [[Iceland]], [[Icelandic name|family names]] are unusual; Icelandic law favours the use of patronyms (and more recently, matronyms) over family names.

==Historical and current use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

===Africa===
Traditionally Muslim and non-Arabic speaking African people, such as [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Fulani]] people usually (with some exceptions) follow the Arab naming pattern.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The word or phrase meaning "son of" is, however, omitted. So Mohamed son of Ibrahim son of Ahmed is "Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed", and Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed's son Ali is "Ali Mohamed Ibrahim".

====Ethiopia and Eritrea====
{{Main|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}
Ethiopians and Eritreans have no concept of family name and surname. If one is to refer to a person with a single name he/she will always use the person's given name. Ethiopian and Eritreans use a naming pattern very similar to the Arab naming pattern, but with one exception: no suffix or prefix. The full name is written as: First name (given name) followed by the father's name, and last by the grandfather's name. For example, Sara Yohannes Petros is Sara (given name) Yohannes (father's name) Petros (grandfather's name). The grandfather's name is usually only used in official documents. The father's name is not considered a middle name. Instead, it is considered a last name. The same is true for females; they do not take their husband's last name. They go independently by their given name, followed by their father's name, and then their grandfather's name, even after marriage.

Some Kenyan communities used patronyms. As of 2010 the practice has largely dropped off with the use of just the father's last name as a surname.
[[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]] use 'arap' meaning 'son of'; 
[[Gikuyu language|Kikuyu]] used 'wa' meaning 'of'. Because of polygamy, matronyms were also used and 'wa' used to identify which wife the child was born of; 
[[Maasai language|Maasai]] use 'ole' meaning 'son of'; 
[[Meru language|Meru]] use 'mto' abbreviated M' thus son of Mkindia would be M'Mkindia, pronounced Mto Mkindia.

====Mozambique====
Patronymic naming is very common in parts of Mozambique.  Although the practice is not universal, patronymic naming has been documented in the Zambezia province.

====Nigeria====
Now not as prominent as before, Many people of southern Nigeria took their father's given name (father's first name) as their surname. It could also be the father's prominent nickname, which takes the place of a first name. An example would be a man named Kolade Fabiyi, who had a son named Dele. The son's name would now be Dele Kolade, not Dele Fabiyi. This is used to distinguish between extended family who would have the same last name, like cousin. This custom has dropped to the modern English one due to increase in British style education.

====Somalia====
Somalis use their paternal grandfather's given name as their legal surname for documentation purpose. They also use the term "ina" or "iña" meaning "the son of" or "the daughter of," which is similar to other African- and the Arab-naming patterns. For example, the name "Ahmed Mohamed Ali Farah" means "Ahmed son of Mohamed son of Ali son of Farah." When stating one's lineage, one will say "Ahmed ina Mohamed" (Ahmed, the son of Mohamed). To identify themselves and the sub=clan they belong to, Somalis memorize their long lineage back a common ancestor. Women never adopt their husbands' patronym but keep theirs for life.

====South Africa====
Among the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] patronymics were used in the pre-colonial era. The prefix "ka" was attached to the father's name, for example [[Shaka kaSenzangakhona]] means Shaka son of Senzangakhona. The practice disappeared from everyday use with the introduction of the modern European style surname system but still remains part of traditional cultural practices, particularly in the case of chieftains and royalty where reciting lineages forms a part of many ceremonial occasions.

===Asia===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

====China====
[[Yi people]]'s sons' given names are based on the last one or two syllables of father's name. [[Hani people]] also have patronymic customs.

====Taiwan====
[[Atayal people]]'s names are followed by the name of their father, both son and daughter are patronymic. 
[[Amis people]]'s son names are also followed by the father's name, while a daughter's name is followed by her mother's name.

====India====

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

Patronymy is common in parts of [[India]]. For example, if a father is named Khurram Suleman (a Muslim masculine name), he might name his son Taha Khurram, who in turn might name his son Ismail Taha. As a result, unlike [[surname]]s, patronymics will not pass down through many generations.

In [[Tamil Nadu]] and some parts of [[Kerala]] and [[South Karnataka]], patronymy is predominant. This is a significant departure from the rest of the country where caste names are mostly employed as surnames. This came into common use during the 1950s and 1960s when the Dravidian movement campaigned against the use one's caste as part of the name.

However, rather than using the father's full name, only the first letter — popularly known as the initial — is prefixed to the given name. For example, if a person's given name is ''Saravanan'' and his father's ''Krishnan'', then the full name is ''K. Saravanan'' and is seldom expanded, even in official records. Only where it is forced by stipulation — such as when applying for an Indian passport which does not usually allow initials — is the initial expanded and the name rendered as "Krishnan Saravanan". Some families follow the tradition of retaining the name of the hometown, the grandfather's name, or both as initials. The celebrated Indian English novelist [[R. K. Narayan]]'s name at birth was Rasipuram Krishnaswami Ayyar Narayanaswami, which was shortened at the behest of his writer friend, [[Graham Greene]]. Rasipuram, the first name, is a [[toponym]] and Krishnaswami Ayyar, the second name, is a patronym.

In Tamilnadu the use of initials and/or surname is up to the prerogative of the person with no strict rules. The late chief minister Karunanidhi preferred to be referred as M. Karunanidhi where the initial M stood for Muthuvel - his father's given name. M.Karunanidhi's son prefers to be referred as M.K.Stalin incorporating both his fathers and grandfather's names. However M.K.Stalin's son prefers to be referred as Udhayanidhi Stalin. Where Udhayanidhi is his given name and Stalin his father's given name as his surname rather than as an initial.

Likewise, cricketer Ashwin son of Ravichandran prefers to be referred to as R.Ashwin or Ravichandran Ashwin. This is because commentators in sports often call players by their last names only and it would be embarrassing to call him by his fathers name, therefore he puts his own given name in the last.

Another upcoming trend is to expand the initials to reflect how it would sound in the native language. For example Karuppiah prefers to be called Pala. Karuppiah instead of P. Karuppiah and his son Palaniappan prefers Karu. Palaniappan. Cinema director Ranjith prefers Pa. Ranjith instead of P. Ranjith as Pa sounds closer to the name in Tamil rather than P which sounds like Pe unlike the first syllable Pa.

Celebrated scientist M. Annadurai would expand his name as Mayilsami Annadurai, however he has to be referred to as Annadurai as referring to him as Mayilsami would be referring to him with his father's given name which could be embarrassing for him.

While the usage of caste names as surnames/last names is discouraged(but not banned) in Tamil Nadu, such usage by out of state people is greeted with indifference. So Lakshmi Menon, Shilpa Shetty, Pranab Mukherjee, Somnath Chaterjee etc. are referred by their preferred names which include their caste names. Likewise old tamil names with caste in them are also fully used while referring to them such as Pasumpoan Muthuramalinga Thevar, U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer etc.

In [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Gujarat]], a very common convention among the Hindu communities is to have the patronymic as the middle name. Examples:

* Cricketer [[Sunil Gavaskar]]'s full name is Sunil Manohar Gavaskar, where Manohar is his father's given name. Sunil Gavaskar's son [[Rohan Gavaskar]] would be Rohan Sunil Gavaskar, and so on.
* Cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]]'s full name is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, where Ramesh is his father's given name.
* First Deputy Prime Minister and first Home Minister [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]]'s full name is Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, where Jhaverbhai is his father's given name.
* India's 15th Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], famously took oath of office as the Prime Minister of India as Narendra Damodardas Modi, where in Damodardas is his father's given name. He prefers to write his full name including his father's name as his middle name.

This system works for both boys and girls, except that after marriage, a woman takes her husband's given name as her middle name – her new middle name is no longer a patronymic.

Indians, particularly [[Tamils]] in [[Singapore]], often continue the patronymic tradition; this entails having a single given name, followed by son / daughter of, followed by their father's name.

[[Malaysian Indians]] may also follow this custom with "son" or "daughter" of being replaced by "anak lelaki" or "anak perempuan", respectively.

Indians of the [[Muslim]] [[Isma'ili]] [[Fiqh|sect]] also have patronymic middle names which use the father's first name and the grandfather's first name plus a family name. Someone called "Ramazan Rahim Ali Manji" might call his son "Karim Ramazan Rahim Manji" and his granddaughter might be called "Zahra Karim Ramazan Manji".

====Southeast Asia====
In [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], ethnic Malays generally follow the Arabic patronymic naming system of ''given name'' + bin/binti + ''father's name''.

In [[Brunei]], the ruling family of the monarch uses ''given name'' + ''ibni'' + ''father's name'' instead of using bin/binti.

In Indonesia, there are a number of ethnic groups with different naming systems. The [[Batak people|Batak]] of [[North Sumatra]] (Sumatra Utara) give every child the family's name. Sometimes the family's name is prefixed by Huta-, Batu-, etc., but most use Si-, such as Sitanggang, Sihombing, Sibutar-butar, Sinaga, or Sitohang. The family's name is given from the father's family. For example, if the father's name is Boggi Sinaga who married to Moetia Siregar then all children will be given family's name of Sinaga.

In Sunda a similar cultural rule is used to that of the Batak. The family's name for [[Sunda language|Sunda]] is -Wijaya, but this isn't true for all [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] families.

=====Arabic=====
{{See also|Arabic name#Nasab}}

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word "[[Wiktionary:ibn|ibn]]" ({{lang|ar|ابن}} or {{lang|ar|بن}}: "bin", "ben" and sometimes "ibni" and "ibnu" to show the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Case|grammatical case]] of the noun) is the equivalent of the "-son" suffix discussed above. (The prefix ben- is used similarly in Hebrew.) In addition, "[[Wiktionary:bint|bint]]" ({{lang|ar|بنت}}) means "daughter of". Thus, for example, "Ali ibn `Amr" means "Ali son of `Amr". In Classical Arabic, the word ''ibn'' is written as ''bn'' between two names, since the case ending of the first name then supplies a vowel. Consequently, ibn is often written as "b.", as bint is often written as "bt.," in name formulas rendered from Arabic into Roman characters. Thus Hisham ibn al-Kalbi is alternatively written as Hisham b. al-Kalbi. However, the pronunciation "bin" is dialectal and has nothing to do with either the spelling or pronunciation in Classical Arabic. The word "Abu" ("Aba" or "Abi" in different grammatical cases) means "father of", so "Abu `Ali" is another name for "`Amr".

In medieval times, an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate child]] of unknown parentage would sometimes be termed "ibn Abihi", "son of his father" (notably [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]].) In the [[Qur'an]],  [[Jesus]] ([[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]] in Arabic) is consistently termed "`Isa ibn Maryam" - a [[matronymic]] (in the Qur'an, Jesus has no father; see [[Islamic view of Jesus]]). An Arabic patronymic can be extended as far back as family tree records will allow: thus, for example, [[Ibn Khaldun]] gives his own full name as "`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Jabir ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn `Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khaldun".

Patronymics are still standard in parts of the Arab world, notably [[Saudi Arabia]] and Iraq. (In the case of Iraq, with the omitted ibn or bint.) However, most of the Arab world has switched to a family name system.{{When|date=May 2015}}  As in English, the new family names are sometimes based on what was formerly a patronymic. Another form widely used in the Arab world is the usage of both the patronymic and a family name, often using both the father's and paternal grandfathers given name in sequence after the own given name, and then the family name. In [[Iraq]] for example, full names are formed by combining the given name of an individual with the given name of their father (sometimes the father is skipped and the paternal grandfather's given name is used instead, sometimes both father and paternal grandfather are used), along with the town, village, or clan name. For instance, Hayder Muhammed al-Tikriti is the son of Muhammed named Hayder, and he is from the town of [[Tikrit]]. In Saudi Arabia naming conventions are similar to Iraq's but family names are used much more often.

=====Aramaic=====
In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the prefix '''''bar-''''' means "son" and is used as a prefix meaning "son of". In the Bible, Peter is called Bar-Jonah in [[Matthew 16:17]] and Nathanael is possibly called Bartholomew because he is the son of Tolmai (or son of Ptolemy, with "P" being reduced). The titles can also be figurative, for example in [[Book of Acts|Acts]] 4:36-37 a man named Joseph is called [[Barnabas]] meaning "son of consolation".

=====Assyrian=====
The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] for centuries have used the patronymic '''''bet''''' or '''''bit''''' literally meaning "house" in [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]; however, in the context of the name it means "from the house of [the father's name]."

=====Jewish=====
{{details|Jewish name}}

[[Jew]]s have historically used [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] patronymic names after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], before which the most common language was [[Aramaic]]. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either '''''ben-''''' or '''''bat-''''' ("son of" and "daughter of", respectively), and then the father's name, mother's name, or both. In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the first name was followed by '''''bar-''''' or '''''bat-''''' ("son of" and "daughter of", respectively).

Permanent family surnames exist today, first by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] in 10th or 11th century [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the late 18th century, when Austria passed the first law requiring Jews adopt surnames. Similar laws were passed in [[Prussia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], France, regions of Germany, and other countries.

While Jews now have permanent surnames for everyday life, the patronymic form is still used in religious life. It is used in [[synagogue]] and in documents in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] such as the [[ketubah]] (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic ''ibn'' instead of ''bat'' or ''ben'' when it was the norm. The Spanish family [[Ibn Ezra (disambiguation)|Ibn Ezra]] is one example.

There is a strong cultural pressure for [[Aliyah|immigrants]] to [[Israel|modern Israel]] to [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraize]] their names.&lt;ref name="Kaganoff"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their History|author=Benzion C. Kaganoff|date= 1996-06-01|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers|ISBN=9781461627203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2IxzRvU_nwcC&amp;pg=PP2 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; 
This practice is especially common among Ashkenazic immigrants, because most of their names were taken during the period from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. For example, [[Golda Meir]] was born "Golda Mabovitch", took the name "Golda Meyerson" after her marriage to American Morris Meyerson, and, upon making [[Aliyah]] and at the urging of [[Moshe Sharett]], [[Hebraization of surnames|Hebraized]] her last name to [[Meir (name)|Meir]].&lt;ref name="Neil Caplan"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 1956 Sinai Campaign Viewed from Asia: Selections from Moshe Sharett's Diaries|author=Neil Caplan|publisher=Indiana University Press|journal=Israel Studies|volume=7|number=1|date=Spring 2002|pages=81–103|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/is/summary/v007/7.1caplan.html|accessdate=June 3, 2014|doi=10.1353/is.2002.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Persian=====
In [[Persian language|Persian]], patronymics پَتوَند are formed by names ending with the suffix "Pur" "پور" for men and "Dokht" "دُخت" for women. For example: Shahpoor (son of king) and Sinapoor (Ebne sina). Depending on country, some suffixes are more common than others. For example, in [[Iran]], the suffix "pur" is common while in [[Afghanistan]], the suffix "Zadah" "زاده" or "Zad" "زاد" is common.

===Europe===
In Western Europe patronyms were formerly widespread but later became confined to Scandinavia and Iceland.

====English====
In England, names ending with the suffix "son" were often originally patronymic. In addition, the archaic [[French language|French]] (more specifically, [[Norman language|Norman]]) prefix ''fitz'' (cognate with the modern French ''[[wikt:fils|fils]]'', meaning "son"), appears in England's aristocratic family lines dating from the [[Norman Conquest]], and also among the [[Anglo-Irish]]. Thus there are names such as Fitzgerald and Fitzhugh. Of particular interest is the name "Fitzroy", meaning "son of [the] king", which was used by illegitimate royal children who were acknowledged as such by their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-258669.html |title=Another Name Question [Archive&amp;#93; - Straight Dope Message Board |publisher=Boards.straightdope.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish, Scottish and Manx====
{{See also|Irish name#Patronyms and other additives}}
{{anchor|Ireland|Scotland|Celtic|Gaelic}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
The use of "Mac" in some form was prevalent in [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], in all of which it denotes "son". "Mc" is also a frequent anglicisation in both Scotland and Ireland. In Ireland, the forms "Mag" and "M'" are encountered. The prefix "Mac" is used to form a patronym, such as "Mac Coinnich" – or the anglicized 'Mackenzie' – son of Coinneach/Kenneth. The female equivalent of ''Mac'' is ''Nic'', condensed from ''nighean mhic'' (in Scottish Gaelic) or ''iníon mhic'' (in Irish), both meaning daughter. For example, the Scottish Gaelic surname, ''Nic Dhòmhnaill'' meaning 'daughter of a son of Dòmhnall' (in English, Donald), as in ''Mairi Nic Dhòmhnaill'', or Mary MacDonald.

At the north end of the [[Irish Sea]], in [[Ulster]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Galloway]] (indeed as far north as [[Argyll]]), "Mac" was frequently truncated in speech to /k/, leading to such anglicisations as "Qualtrough" (Son of Walter) &amp; "Quayle" (son of Paul, cf. [[MacPhail (disambiguation)|MacPhail]]) – usually beginning with "C", "K" or "Q". In Ireland, this truncation resulted in surnames such as "Guinness" (son of Aonghus, cf. MacAonghusa) beginning usually in "C" or "G" for patronymics prefixed with Mac, and in "H" (e.g. "Hurley" (descendant of Jarlath, cf. Ua h-Iarfhlatha/O'Hurley)) for surnames prefixed with "O". Colloquial Scottish Gaelic also has other patronymics of a slightly different form for individuals, still in use (for more information please see: [[Scottish Gaelic personal naming system]]).

====Welsh and Cornish====
{{anchor|Wales|Cornwall}}
{{see also|Welsh surnames|Cornish surnames}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Before the 1536 [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|Act of Union]], the Welsh did not generally employ surnames, but instead used [[epithet]]s (e.g. [[Selyf Sarffgadau]], "Selyf the Battle-Serpent"), patronyms (e.g. [[Rhodri the Great|Rhodri ap Merfyn]], "Rhodri son of Merfyn"), and (much less often) matronyms (e.g. [[Rhodri the Great|Rhodri ap Nest]], "Rhodri son of Nest") to identify people. Welsh, as a [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P-Celtic language]], originally used ''map'' or ''mab'' instead of the [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|Q-Celtic]] ''mac'' employed in Ireland and Scotland. These were later simplified to the [[modern Welsh]] ''ap'' and ''ab''. A common practice is to use ''ab'' before a father's name beginning with a vowel (e.g., [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]]), but they{{clarify|date=August 2015}} are also employed arbitrarily in many sources.

Daughters were indicated by ''ferch'' or ''verch'' ([[Welsh language#mutation|mutated]] from ''merch'', "girl, daughter"). ''Angharad verch Owain'' would be "Angharad, daughter of Owain".

After the Acts of Union, this led to many Welsh surnames being variants of their father or ancestor's personal name: ''ap'' or ''ab Ieuan'' often became "Evans"; ''ap Rhys'', "Price"; ''ap'' or ''ab Owain'', "Bowen"; ''ap Hywel'', "Powell" or "Howell". In addition to these Anglicised baptismal and official names, patronyms continued to be commonly employed in Welsh until the [[Industrial Revolution]], particularly in the north and west of Wales. Patronyms were sometimes employed within the English names as well by using the father's personal name as the sons' [[middle name]].

Similar rules might apply in [[Cornish surnames|Cornwall]] were it not for its earlier inclusion into England; and therefore patronyms (e.g.[m]ap Ros&gt;Rouse, [m]ap Richard&gt;Pritchard, Davies, Evans) are less common than [[Toponymic surname|toponyms]] (e.g. [[Tresillian]], Trevithick, [[Nankivell|Nanskeval/Nankeville]]) and occupational surnames (e.g. [[An Gof]], [An] Gove, ''([[Blacksmith]])''; Helyer (Cornish dialect - possibly a [[slater]] or [[Hunter|huntsman]] (helgher)).&lt;ref name="Kernow names"&gt;[reepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~kernow/names_h.htm Rootsweb Ancestry.com - Kernow names]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dutch====
In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], patronymics were often used in place of [[family name]]s or as middle names. Patronymics were composed of the father's name plus an ending ''-zoon'' for sons, ''-dochter'' for daughters. For instance, [[Abel Tasman|Abel Janszoon Tasman]] is "Abel son of Jan Tasman", and [[Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer]]: "Kenau, daughter of Simon Hasselaer". In written form, these endings were often abbreviated as ''-sz.'' and ''-dr.'' respectively e.g. Jeroen Corneli'''sz'''. "Jeroen son of Cornelis", or [[Dirck Jacobsz.|Dirck Jacobsz]]. The endings ''-s'', ''-se'' and ''-sen'' were also commonly used for sons and often for daughters too. In the northern provinces, ''-s'', as [[genitive case]], was almost universally used for both sons and daughters. The suffix -''x'' as in "Tacx" also denoted the son or daughter of Tac, and is now integrated as a complete name.

Patronymics were common in the Dutch [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] until the [[France|French]] invasion in 1795 and subsequent annexation in 1810. As the Netherlands were now a province of France, a registry of births, deaths and marriages was established in 1811, whereupon [[emperor]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] forced the Dutch to register and adopt a distinct surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republikanisme.nl/naamgeving.html|title=Decreet van Naamsaanneming (Napoleon, 18 augustus 1811)|accessdate=2009-04-29|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912024314/http://www.republikanisme.nl/naamgeving.html|archivedate=2009-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====French====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In France, the terms ''patronyme'' and ''nom patronymique'' had long been used interchangeably to designate the family name, meaning that it is inherited from the father.

The tradition of patronymic lineage is still used among some Canadian descendants of French colonists: in the oral tradition of many [[Acadians]], for example, ''Marc à Pierre à Gérard'' (lit. "Marc of Pierre of Gérard"), means "Marc, son of Pierre, grandson of Gérard".

====Iberian peninsula====
{{see also|Spanish naming customs|Portuguese naming customs}}
In the past, both in Spanish and Portuguese, the endings ''-ez'' and ''-es'' tended to be conflated since pronunciation was quite similar in the two languages. Today, Portuguese has been fully standardized to ''-es''; Spanish is also standardized to ''-ez'', but it is very common to see archaic endings in ''-es''. For instance, [[Pires (disambiguation)|Pires]]/[[Peres]] and [[Pérez]] are the modern forms of "[[Peterson (name)|Peterson]]" in Portuguese and Spanish.

In [[Portugal]], there are some surnames which had a patronymic genesis, while still common they no longer indicate patronymic usage. For instance, ''Álvares'' was the son of ''Álvaro'' and ''Gonçalves'' was the son of ''Gonçalo'' (it was the case of [[Nuno Álvares Pereira]], son of Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira, son of Gonçalo Pereira). Other cases include ''Rodrigues'' (''son of Rodrigo''), ''Nunes'' (''son of Nuno'') and ''Fernandes'' (''son of Fernando'').
In the same way the surname Soares means son of Soeiro (in Latin Suarius). It comes from Latin Suaricius (son of Suarius); the Latin [[genitive]] suffix ''-icius/a'' was used to indicate a patronymic. Later it became Suáriz, Suárez and eventually Soares. Another theory attributes the Iberian -ez style patronymics to Germanic (Visigothic) rather than Latin influence.&lt;ref name=port-names1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=port-names2 /&gt;

[[Spain|Spanish]] patronyms follow a similar pattern to the Portuguese (e.g., [[López]]: of Lope; [[Hernández]]: of Hernán; [[Álvarez (surname)|Álvarez]]: of Álvaro). Common endings include -ez, -az, -is, and -oz. However, not all names with similar endings are necessarily patronymic. For example, Chávez is not the son of ''Chavo'', but comes from [[Galician language|Galician]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Chaves'', meaning "keys", and its "s" stands for the plural form, as in key/keys in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kvs/heraldry/spanish16/ |title=16th Century Spanish Names |author=Elsbeth Anne Roth (Kathy Van Stone) |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science |date=2002 |accessdate=2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandinavian languages====
{{see also|Icelandic name}}

In Norse custom patronyms and matronyms were formed by using the ending -son (later -søn and -sen in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[German language|German]]) to the [[genitive case|genitive]] form of the father's name to indicate "son of", and -dóttir ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and Faroese -dóttir, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and Norwegian -dotter, Danish and Norwegian -datter) for "daughter of". This name was generally used as a last name although a third name, a so-called byname based on location or personal characteristic, was often added to differentiate people and could eventually develop into a kind of [[family name]]. Some [[Early Modern]] examples of the latter practice, where the patronymic was placed after the given name and was followed by the surname, are Norwegian [[Peder Claussøn Friis]], the son of Nicolas Thorolfsen Friis (Claus in Claussøn being short for Nicolas) and Danish [[Thomas Kingo|Thomas Hansen Kingo]], the son of Hans Thomsen Kingo.

Eventually, most Nordic countries replaced or complemented this system with the prevailing "international" standard of inherited family names. In Norway, for example, the [[Storting|parliament]] passed a family name act in 1923, citing the rising population and the need to avoid the confusion of new last names in every generation. The law does allow a person to retain a patronymic as a [[middle name]] in addition to the surname, as was common in Early Modern times; this is not a common practice, but does occur, a modern example being [[Audhild Gregoriusdotter Rotevatn]]. The Danish government outlawed the practice in 1856 and eased the regulations in 1904 to deal with the limited number of patronymics. In Sweden the practice of children keeping their father's and wives keeping their husband's patronymic as a surname occurred in the 1700s but was first prevalent in the late 1800s, still present yet uncommon in the 1900s and finally abolished in 1966. In 1982 the right to use patronyms (and matronyms) was partially restored, and from 1 July 2017 parents in Sweden are free to give their children patronyms/matronyms at birth instead of inherited family names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En ny lag om personnamn|url=http://www.regeringen.se/rattsdokument/lagradsremiss/2016/04/en-ny-lag-om-personnamn/|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matronyms were used exceptionally if the child was born out of wedlock or if the mother was much more high-born or well known than the father, a historical example being [[Sweyn Estridsson]].

[[Icelandic name|In Iceland]], patronymics or matronymics are still used as last names and this is in fact compulsory by law, with a handful of exceptions. The father's name (occasionally with a minor alteration for genitive) plus the word ''son'' for sons, ''dóttir'' for daughters.&lt;ref name="namelaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/135a/1996045.html|title=Lög um mannanöfn |author=Alþingi Íslands|accessdate=2008-04-02|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] (to be read in English as "Jóhanna, daughter of Sigurð[ur]").

====Finnish====

In [[Finland]], the use of patronymics was a result of relatively recent Swedish influence and remained uncommon outside official documents. Only in the 19th century did the use of patronymics gain any sort of popularity among the [[Finnish language|Finnish-speaking]] lower classes.&lt;ref name="paikkala"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paikkala|first1=Sirkka|title=Patronyymit ja matronyymit sukututkimuksissa|url=http://www.genealogia.fi/nimet/nimi16s.htm|website=genealogia.fi|publisher=Suomen Sukututkimusseura|accessdate=2 August 2015|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family names became obligatory in Finland by law in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fi:Nimilaki]]{{Better source|date=June 2017|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, patronymics were composed in Swedish fashion: the father's name and the suffix -n for genitive plus the word ''poika'' for sons, ''tytär'' for daughters. For example, Tuomas Abrahaminpoika (to be read in English as "Tuomas, Abraham's son") and Martta Heikintytär (to be read in English as "Martta, Heikki's daughter").&lt;ref name="paikkala" /&gt;

====Bulgarian====
In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the patronymics are ''-ov''/''-ev'' and ''-ova''/''-eva'' for men and women, respectively. These are identical to the endings of ''family'' names in Bulgarian and some other Slavic family names (such as names in Russian and [[Czech language|Czech]]). In Bulgarian official documents, the patronymic is inserted before the surname - e.g. ''Ivan Marinov Yordanov'' would be the son of ''Marin Yordanov''.

====Caucasus====

=====Armenian=====
{{main|Armenian surnames}}

The use of patronymics was introduced in Armenia by Russians during the times of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Previously to that the use of patronymics was very limited. Patronymics are usually formed by addition of "i" ("of", pronounced as ee) to the father's name, e.g. if father's name is "Armen", the corresponding patronymic would be "Armeni" (of Armen). Russified version of the same patronymic would be "Armenovich" for males and "Armenovna" for females. After Armenia re-gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 a massive decline in the use of Russified patronymics occurred; nowadays few Armenians use patronymics outside of official contexts.

Many Armenian surnames were once patronymics first used by distant ancestors or clan founders. These are characterized by the suffix "-ian" in Western Armenian, often transliterated as "-yan" in Eastern Armenian. These are appended to the given name, i.e. Kardash'''ian''', Asdvadzadour'''ian''', Hagop'''ian''', Khachadour'''ian''', Mardiros'''ian''', Bedros'''ian''', Sarkiss'''ian''', etc. Note that the suffix "-ian" was also appended to trades, as in Adakhtsakordz'''ian''' (issued from the carpenter), Chalian (issued from the candlemaker, using the Turkish word "chal", meaning candle).

Of particular note are the surnames of the children of married priests, or kahanas. Though not as common nowadays, it was customary for a long time for these children (particularly the sons) to change their last names to the name-in-religion of their father. For example, the son of Ter (Reverend) Bartev would change his last name to Ter Bartevian.

=====Azerbaijani=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], patronymics are formed through ''[[:wikt:oğul|-oğlu]]'' (sometimes transliterated as ''ogly'') for males and ''[[:wikt:qız|qızı]]'' (often transliterated as ''gizi'' or ''kizi'') for females. Prior to the late 19th–early 20th century, patronymics were used as an essential part of a person's full name, i.e. ''Sardar Ilyas oğlu'' ("Sardar, son of Ilyas") and ''Mina Nabi qızı'' ("Mina, daughter of Nabi"), since surnames were mostly non-existent before [[Sovietization]] (with the exception of the upper and some middle-class families). After surnames were commonly adopted in [[Azerbaijan]] in the 1920s, patronymics still remained parts of full names, i.e. ''Sardar Ilyas oğlu Aliyev'' ("Sardar Aliyev, son of Ilyas"). Nowadays in Azerbaijan, patronymics sometimes replace surnames in unofficial use. Normally in such case, they are spelled as one word (i.e. ''Eldar Mammadoğlu'', ''Sabina Yusifqızı''). Many Azeri surnames are also derived from Persian-style patronymics ending in ''-zadeh'' (''Kazimzadeh'', ''Mehdizadeh'', etc.). They are found among both Caucasian and Iranian Azeris. However unlike the former, Azeris in Iran do not generally use patronymics in ''oglu'' / ''qizi''. Azeri patronymics are not to be confused with [[Turkish language|Turkish]] surnames in ''-oğlu'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] surnames in -ογλού (''-oglou''), which do not have specific female versions and do not reflect names of fathers.

=====Georgian=====
{{main|Georgian surname}}
In Georgian, patronymics, when used, come with the addition of ''s'' to the end of the father's name, followed by ''dze'' for a man and ''asuli'' for a woman. For example, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s actual name was Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili. ''s'' in Georgian is a possessive, and ''dze'' and ''asuli'' mean male and female descendant. After collapse of the USSR, patronymics in Georgia are disused as part of Russian tradition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Georgian last names derive mostly from patronymics, nicknames and places of origin. Two common elements in Georgian last names, ''dze'' and ''shvili'' mean son of, and child, respectively.

====Greek and Greek Cypriot====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Most [[Greek language|Greek]] surnames are patronymics by origin, albeit in various forms depending on ancestral locality. Diminutive suffixes which denote "''son of''", or more generally "''descendant of''", are produced as follows: starting with the given name Δημήτριος, ''Dēmétrios'', for example, the patronymic surnames Dēmētr''ópoulos'' ([[Peloponnese]]), Dēmētr''ákos'' ([[Laconia]]), Dēmētr''éas'' ([[Messenia]]n [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]]), Dēmētr''átos'' ([[Cephalonia]]), Dēmētr''ákēs'' ([[Crete]]), Dēmētr''iádēs''/Dēmētr''-ídēs'' ([[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Asia Minor]]), Dēmētr''éllēs'' ([[Lesbos]]), Dēmétr''oglou'' ([[Asia Minor]]) (identical to Turkish patronym ''-oğlu''), or simply ''Dēmētríou'' (esp. common in [[Cyprus]], the first name in the [[Genitive]]) are formed. The same principle can apply to surnames deriving from professions, for example from παπάς, ''papás'', priest, one derives the surnames ''Papadópoulos, Papadákos, Papadéas, Papadátos, Papadákēs, Papadéllēs, Papazoglou'' etc., all of which signify a "priest's son". The same principle(s) may apply in combination, e.g. ''Papanikoláou, Papanikolópoulos'', "the son of the priest Nikolaos". A daughter's family name is the same as the son's, but ''always'' declined in the [[Genitive]], e.g. ''Dēmētropoúlou, Papanikoláou'' etc.

In addition to these surnames, ''actual'' patronymics are used in official documents as "middle names" preceding the surname. For example, the children of a ''Giánnēs Papadópoulos'' are, say, ''María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou'' and ''Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos'' (''Ioánnou'' is the [[genitive case]] form of ''Ioánnēs'', which is the formal form of the father's name, ''Giánnēs''). Traditionally, a married woman would adopt her husband's family name. Now, however, women in Greece can keep their own surname if they so choose.

====Hungarian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], patronyms were traditionally formed with the ending ''-fi'' (sometimes spelled as ''-fy'' or ''-ffy''). This system is no longer in common use, though traces of it can still be found in some frequent present-day surnames such as ''Pálfi'' (son of Paul), ''Győrfi'', ''Bánfi'' or in the name of the famous poet [[Sándor Petőfi]] (who chose this Hungarian form instead of his Slavic birth name ''Petrovics''). In the Old Hungarian period (10th−16th century, see [[History of Hungarian]]), when surnames were not in common use, the full genitive was represented as in ''Péter fia András'' (''Peter's son Andrew''); these forms are in frequent use in charters and legal documents dated back to that time.

====Romanian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the endings ''-escu'' and ''-eanu'' were used, as in ''Petrescu'', 'son of Petre (Peter)'; many modern Romanian family names were formed from such patronymics. Less commonly, matronymics formed with the [[Genitive case|genitive]] form (using the prefix ''a-'') were used, as in ''Amariei'', '(son/daughter) of Maria'.

====Russian====
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
In [[East Slavic languages]], the endings ''-ovich'', ''-evich'' and ''-ich'' are used to form patronymics for men. It would be cognate to the Latin genitive -ici, used for marking family line, and also as equivalent to: 'little' -Vladic= 'the little Vlad'-. For women, the ending is ''-yevna'', ''-ovna'' or ''-ichna''. For example, in [[Russian language|Russian]], a man named Ivan with a father named Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or "Ivan, son of Nikolay" (''Nikolayevich'' being a patronymic). Likewise, a woman named Lyudmila with a father named Nikolay would be known as Lyudmila Nikolayevna or "Lyudmila, daughter of Nikolay" (''Nikolayevna'' being a patronymic). For masculine names ending in a vowel, such as Ilya or Foma, when they are used as a base for patronymic, the corresponding endings are ''-ich'' (for men) and ''-inichna'' (for women). Examples in titles  of classical Russian literature include'' [[The Belkin Tales|The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin]]'', ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and "[[The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich]]".

In Russia, the patronymic is an official part of the name, used in all official documents, and when addressing somebody both formally and among friends.&lt;ref name=rus1&gt;{{cite book |last=Cubberley |first=Paul |date=17 October 2002 |title=Russian: A Linguistic Introduction |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=355 |isbn=9780521796415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rus2&gt;{{cite book |last=Stakhnevich |first=Julia |date=2007 |title=The Everything Learning Russian Book |publisher=Everything Books |page=74 |isbn=9781598693874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are addressed by their given name followed by patronymic (e.g., "Mikhail Nikolayevich") in many situations including on formal occasions, by colleagues at work, by acquaintances, or when addressed by someone younger in age.&lt;ref name=rus1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rus3&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Smorodinskaya |editor1-first=Tatiana |editor2-last=Evans-Romaine |editor2-first=Karen |editor3-last=Goscilo |editor3-first=Helena |date=2007 |title=Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Russian |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=412 |isbn=9781136787867}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is becoming more common for younger individuals (under 50) to drop the patronymic at work.&lt;ref name=rus3/&gt; In informal situations, if a person is called by a [[diminutive]] (such as Misha for Mikhail or Nastya for Anastasia), the patronymic is not used.&lt;ref name=rus2/&gt;

In [[colloquial]], informal speech, it is also possible to contract the ending of a patronymic: thus Nikolayevich becomes Nikolaich, and Stepan Ivanovich becomes Stepan Ivanych or simply Ivanych as the [[given name]] may be omitted altogether. In this case the contraction, if possible, is obligatory: Ivan Sergeyevich Sidorov may be called "Sergeich" or, more rarely, "Sergeyevich". In contrast to male names, if a woman is called by her patronymic name without a given name, the patronymic is usually not contracted: "Ivanovna" but "Mar' Ivanna"; "Sergeyevna"/"Sergevna" is one exception, where both forms are fine. Typically, a patronymic name alone is a familiar form of addressing an older female.

====Serbian====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
[[Vuk Karadžić]] reported in the 19th century that Serbs sometimes used their old family names, and sometimes patronymics. Vuk Karadžić himself used patronymic Stefanović (son of Steven), and sometimes Karadzić, old family name. However, nowadays, the patronymic names in Serbia are mostly used on legal documents, and have the form of the father's name that says the child is 'of so and so'... example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlovic, where Dragoljub is the father's name and 'Dragoljuba' literally means 'of Dragoljub'.

In Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, the patronymic names do not change form between [[Grammatical gender|masculine]] and [[Grammatical gender|feminine]].  Example: Marija Dragoljuba Pavlović (Dragoljub is the father's name; Dragoljuba is the form that says she is his daughter, or literally 'of Dragoljub').

====Turkish&lt;!--Turkish not Turkic: see talk page--&gt;====
{{main|Turkish name}}
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the [[suffix]]es used to indicate paternal ancestry are ''[[:wikt:oğul|-oğlu]]'' and ''[[:wikt:zadeh|-zade]]'', which indicate the ancestry as coming from a certain man. Like many other patronymics in other languages, with the formalization of naming conventions by laws in the [[late modern history|late modern]] [[Contemporary history|contemporary age]] many turned into surnames. After the '[[Surname Law|Surname revolution]]' in 1934, many people chose professions or habitat as surnames with or without the suffix ''-oğlu'', such as ''Elbeyioğlu'', ''Bakkaloğlu'' or ''Giritlioğlu'' and with ''-zade'' such as ''[[Begzada|Beyzade]]'', ''Mehmedzade'', ''Yusufzade''.

====Ukrainian====
In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], the female patronymic always ends with ''-івна'' ''(-ivna)'' or ''-ївна'' ''(-yivna)''.&lt;ref name=LPUkraine/&gt; The male patronymic always ends with -''ович'' ''(-ovych)'' or ''-йович'' ''(-yovych)''.&lt;ref name=LPUkraine&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MUmCGXMhQuYC&amp;pg=PA52 Ukrainian:Lonely Planet Phrasebook] by [[Marko Pavlyshyn]], [[Lonely Planet]], 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-74104-605-2}} (page 52)&lt;/ref&gt; Exception: ''Illia (Ілля)'' -&gt; ''Illich (Ілліч)'' (e.g. [[Élie Metchnikoff|Illia Illich Mechnikov]]), ''Sava (Сава)'' -&gt; ''Savych (Савич)'', ''Iakiv (Яків)'' -&gt; ''Iakovych (Якович)''&lt;ref&gt;Потелло Н.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">'''Production babies''' are children born to anyone involved in the making of a film during its [[filmmaking|production]]. The phrase generally refers to a section of the [[closing credits]] of films, listing the babies' [[given name]]s. The custom of publishing lists of production babies began with [[animated film]]s, and is still chiefly found in that genre, reflecting the influence of family experiences on storytelling in such films.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

The first list of production babies was included by [[Pixar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Jonathan|title=Cars|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tasmania/stories/s1664829.htm|work=Review|publisher=[[ABC Tasmania]]|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the credits of their first full-length movie ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0114709|Toy Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Unkrich]], a film director with Pixar, explains that the production team and [[film crew]] indelibly associate the birth of each of their children with the film they were working on at the time. The listing in the end credits becomes a way for them to share these essential memories more widely. "It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies."&lt;ref name=sfgate2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|title=Pixar delivers, babies get credit|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-06-13/entertainment/21907955_1_toy-story-john-lasseter-pixar|publisher=[[SFGate]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twists added in film credits include a list of "Chameleon Babies" at the end of the 2010 animated film ''[[Tangled]]'', born to the real-life model for the pet in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Ed|title=A Virtual Roundtable with "Tangled" Co-Directors Byron Howard &amp; Nathan Greno|url=http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|publisher=ToonZone.net|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=April 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822013323/http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|archivedate=August 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 animated film ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' lists the names under "Pooh Babies," with the credit knitted on a piece of fabric by the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]].

[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film director [[Byron Howard]] cites the listing of production babies as a pointer to the depth of personal relationships established during collaboration on an animated movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hucks|first=Dustin|title=Interviews: The Cast of'' 'Tangled' ''Gets Unraveled|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/interviews-the-cast-of-tangled-gets-unraveled.php|publisher=FilmSchoolRejects.com|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star next to a baby's name honors a baby who passed away before production was complete.

In 2009, [[Ari Folman]] dedicated his [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award]] to the eight production babies born during the making of ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'', an animated anti-war documentary, and expressed hope that their lives would have no contact with the realities of conflict depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's 'Waltz with Bashir,' on 1982 Lebanon War, wins Golden Globe for best foreign film|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-s-waltz-with-bashir-on-1982-lebanon-war-wins-golden-globe-for-best-foreign-film-1.267916|accessdate=January 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have noted that "production babies" credits indicate the creativity of film people in giving some unusual names to their children.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

An early, isolated instance in video games occurred with an [[Easter egg (media)#Software|easter egg]] message embedded in the ROM for the 1988 game ''Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball'' for Mattel [[Intellivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Production Baby|url=http://daddytypes.com/2013/01/15/the_first_production_baby.php |date=January 15, 2013 |publisher=DaddyTypes |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern custom spread to [[video game]] credits in the 2005 game ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'', and the 2009 game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', which also listed the other parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/credits|work=Credits|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the list was changed to "Development Babies" in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. A number of other games have since done the same.

'''Qutalmish''' ({{lang-1ca|قُتَلمِش}}, {{lang-fa|قتلمش}}) (alternative spellings: '''Qutulmush''', '''Kutalmish''', {{lang|tr|'''Kutalmış'''}}) was a Turkic prince who was a member of Seljukid house in the 11th century. His son [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Kutalmışoglu Suleiman]], founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in what is now Turkey.

==Sultanate of Rûm==
Kutalmish was the son of [[Arslan Yabgu]] and a cousin of [[Tughril]] and played a vital role in the conquests of the [[Seljuq Turks]]. In 1046, he was sent with an army by Tughril to force back the Byzantine army at Ganja and was victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker, ''The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna'', (Greenwood Publishing, 2000), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He supported a rebellion against Tughril and contested the succession to the throne with [[Alp Arslan]]. (''see'' [[Battle of Damghan (1063)]]) According to the historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], Kutalmish knew the sciences of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Institutionalisation of Science in the Medreses of pre-Ottoman and Ottoman Turkey'', Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, '''Turkish Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science''', Ed. Gürol Irzik and Güven Güzeldere, (Springer, 2005), 267.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Suleiman]], was recognized as Sultan of [[Sultanate of Rûm|Rûm]] by [[Malik Shah I]] in 1084.&lt;ref&gt;Köprülü, Mehmed Fuad.

A '''religious name''' is a type of [[given name]] bestowed for a religious purpose, and which is generally used in religious contexts.  Different types of religious names may be in use among  [[clergy]] of a religion, as well in some cases among the [[laity]].

==Christianity==

===Catholic Church===

====Baptism name====
In [[baptism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] are given a [[Christian name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |title=Christian Names |year=1911 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |publication-place=[[New York City|New York]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be "foreign to Christian sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7K.HTM#$295 Code of Canon Law, canon 2156]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often the name of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=207 Catholic Activity: Baptismal Names]&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.

====Confirmation name====
In some countries, it is common to adopt a [[Confirmation#Confirmation name|confirmation name]], in addition to the baptismal name.

====Monastic and papal name====
In some [[religious institute]]s, a new member takes a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their ''[[:it:al secolo]]'' name. A [[Papal election|newly elected]] [[Pope]] also takes on a new name, called his [[regnal name]] or [[papal name]].

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Baptism name====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by [[baptism]] or [[chrismation]]. A person's religious name is always the name of a [[saint]], who then becomes that person's [[patron saint]]. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their "[[name day]]" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.

====Monastic name====
Orthodox [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s are often given a new monastic name at the time of their [[tonsure]] (i.e., when they take their [[monastic vows]]). A monastic name is usually the name of a [[prophet]] or a [[monastic]] saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.

==Judaism==
[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] take a [[Hebrew name]] upon conversion.  Born Jews generally have a [[patronymic]] Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their [[legal name]], especially when the latter is of [[gentile]] or non-Hebrew origin.

==Buddhism==
Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects also practice this, with newly ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given [[Dharma name]]s during their [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge ceremony]].

==Others==

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
Members of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] and some other [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organisations are given a "spiritual name" by their [[guru]] upon initiation. This name ends in "Das" or "Dasa" for men and "Dasi" for women (meaning "servant"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], a [[craft name]] is often used.

===Parody religions===
It is usual for a [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Discordian Episkopos]] to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related [[Church of the SubGenius]].

According to the post-1900 publications of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the writings of [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], etc., as well as those authors influenced by the theosophical teachings such as [[Alice A. Bailey]], and [[Benjamin Creme]], and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] of [[Guy Ballard]], [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]],  [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings / teachers,&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lord Sunat Kumara'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is an "Advanced Being" at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ninth level of initiation]] who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of [[Earth]] and of the [[Human race|humanity]], and is thought to be the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]] (also known as 'The City of Enoch').

Shamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the [[etheric plane]] somewhere above the [[Gobi Desert]] in the borderlands of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;(See: '[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]' By [[Yogananda Paramahansa]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A Tibetan Journey]] By Alexandra David-Neale. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great White Brotherhood]] is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.

According to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in [[Peru]], where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[[Authors Notes: 'The Refuge of the Apocalypse.]] By Elizabeth Van Buren. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] (called in the Ascended Master Teachings [[Ascended Master]]s) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sunat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in Hinduism==
Sanat Kumara appears as a [[rishi]] in the [[Hindu]] [[religious text]] the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of [[Kataragama]], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Sanskrit, "Sanat Kumara" is "Eternal Youth" (from [[Sant (religion)|Sanat]] "eternal", Ku "with difficulty" and Mara "mortal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danijel.org/index.php?id=clanak&amp;articleID=161&amp;pageID=22 O znalcima vraga] — Danijel Turina&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, [[Shamballa]], the [[sahasrara]] of the world.  The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called ''Sanatana''; at the Cosmic plane, it is ''Subrahmanya''; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is ''Sanaka''; at the Planetary plane, it is ''Sanandana''; and on this planet, it is ''Sanath'' Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.

Scriptures, especially the [[Mahabharata]], say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when [[Lord Krishna]] came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named [[Pradyumna]]. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother [[Rukmini]] as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of [[Mahabharata]].

==Shamballa in Buddhism – home of the King of the World==

''Shambhala'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Tib]]. ''bde 'byung'') in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] (the religion of [[Tibet]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "place of peace/tranquility/happiness". [[Gautama Buddha]] is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] on request of King [[Suchandra]] of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa.  The [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] from which [[Madame Blavatsky]] claimed to have gotten the information in [[The Secret Doctrine]] are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words ''Kalachakra tantra'' (''rGyud-sde'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reigle, David and Nancy ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' San Diego 1999. {{ISBN|0-913510-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shambhala is ruled over by a line of [[Kings of Shambhala]] known as [[Kulika]] or [[Kalki]] Kings (Tib. ''Rigden''), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the ''Kalachakra tantra''. In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as ''The King of the World''.  Shamballa was thought by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s to be somewhere north of [[Lake Manasarovar]] and its adjacent [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]], a [[sacred mountain]] in Tibet where it is thought that all the [[Ley line|dragon current]]s intersect.

==The Defender Lord at Kurama Temple==
The ancient Buddhist temple, [[Kurama-dera]] in [[Japan]], is host to a unique bodhisattva, the "Defender Lord", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Sanat Kumara in Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Sanat Kumara  was mentioned briefly  by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara – Volume I: 89, 457–458; Volume II: pages 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition has presented as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II pp 243 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague  [[Charles W. Leadbeater]] wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] of [[Mahatma]]s who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=sanat+kumara+theosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ts3XnQyt-F&amp;sig=IEXRZ-Z1gLLBh6-bQnczyiul1BM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-I-i6bvKAhXGlh4KHbeKBhk4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sanat%20kumara%20theosophy&amp;f=false First Principles of Theosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Descent of Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Living Flame from Venus==
C.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the [[etheric plane]] of the planet [[Venus]] to [[Earth]] 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] of [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from [[Venus]] are called the "Lords of the Flame".  C.W. Leadbeater and [[Annie Besant]] said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 "Lords of the Flame" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the later version of the story promulgated by [[Guy Ballard]], notable "Lords of the Flame" include [[Gautama Buddha]], and the [[World Teacher]] (the being referred to alternately as [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] or [[Christ]] by [[Benjamin Creme]]). [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]'s [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought [[144,000]] souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.

Sanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as [[Murugan|Skanda]]/[[Kartikkeya]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]]-'''Sanam Kumar''' in [[Buddhism]], the [[Ancient of Days]] in [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, and identify him as [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is [[Al Khdir]] (green man) known to [[Sufi]] Muslims (according to [[Dakshinamurti]]).

It is maintained in most of these versions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that [[Venus]], the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced [[planet]] of our [[solar system]]. The beings living on the [[etheric plane]] of [[Venus]] are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London: 1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See chart on Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the governing council of [[Venus]] – the ''Seven Holy Kumars'' – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press, pages 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]] to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.

==City plan of Shamballa==
The main temple of Shamballa is topped with a [[Gold (color)|golden]] dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays.  These temples are located on a number of wide [[boulevard]]s resembling the [[Champs-Elysees]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet, (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 465–470 Shamballa&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, [[George Washington]] was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose [[city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] to create the [[city plan]] of [[Washington DC]] which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.

==Appellations (titles) of Sanat Kumara==
The most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is "Lord of the World". [[C.W. Leadbeater]] also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every [[Wesak]] (the Full Moon of May) led by [[Gautama Buddha]], and also participated in by the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] (the being Theosophists identify as [[Christ]]), in which [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] is focused from the "Solar Logos" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance.  The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern [[Tibet]] (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book ''The Masters and the Path'' has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the [[etheric body]] or in the [[physical body]] by those who have [[third eye|etheric sight]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) – Fold-out picture facing the title page of the book shows a picture of Lord Sananda Buddha performing the Wesak ritual&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: "The Ancient of Days" (because he has been on [[Earth]] millions of years) and "The Youth of Sixteen Summers" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old).  Another of his titles is "The One Initiator" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the ''Masters and the Path'' that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]].  [[Alice A. Bailey]] indicates the same in her writings.

In the all organizations subscribing to the "''Ascended Master Teachings''", Sanat Kumara is presented  as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]]. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the "Regent Lord of the World" in deference to [[Gautama Buddha]] having taken the office of "Lord of the World".

Describes Sanat Kumara and his role in founding the Brotherhood on Earth and passing the office of "Lord of the World" to Lord Sananda.&lt;/ref&gt; With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what [[Joshua David Stone]] calls the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Galactic Confederation of Planets|Galactic Confederation of Planets]].

Sanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as ''Lord of the World'' is a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magic wand]] called the ''Rod of Power'' made of the metal [[orichalcum]], with cone-shaped [[diamond]]s on each end.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Venus==
[[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] and all other "[[Ascended Master Teachings]]" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a ''Divine Complement'' (''Twin Flame'') (i.e., a ''celestial wife'') – '''Lady Master Venus'''[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg Image of Lady Master Venus shown above is originally from the Church Universal and Triumphant):]&lt;/ref&gt; – the New Age "[[goddess|Goddess of Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Summarizes the beliefs about Sanat Kumara by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt; The Ascended ''Lady Master Venus'' is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.  Sanat Kumara is believed to have [[Marriage|married]] Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.

==Lady Master Meta==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the '''Lady Master Meta''' [http://www.ethericretreats.com/images/meta.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/meta.htm Source of (not very clear) Image of the Lady Master Meta—Etheric Retreats website:]&lt;/ref&gt; who they brought with them from Venus.  She is said to have incarnated as an [[Avatar]] in Atlantis (where she served as the [[high priestess]] at the ''Temple of Healing'') and in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian Persia]], where she married a [[wikt:mortality|mortal]] and had three children.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the ''Goddess of Healing'' and is the patron deity of [[physician|doctor]]s and [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt; Since she is [[Immortality|immortal]], possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.

==Master Cha Ara==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the '''Master Cha Ara''' [http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/BofLight/CHA-ARA.JPG ] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/brotherhoodoflight.htm Source of Image of Master Cha Ara – World Global Express Brotherhood of Light:]&lt;/ref&gt;
was originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in [[Sassanian empire|Sassanian Persia]].  He became a master [[alchemy|alchemist]] who formulated an [[elixir of immortality]] made from [[Rose|rose petals]], tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients.  This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood.  He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people.  He is the protector of all [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].  He works with [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] to bring about the New Age in the West [[Americas]].  Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 52 Master Cha Ara; pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Nada==

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], '''Lady Master Nada'''&lt;ref&gt;Artist concept:[http://www.summitlh.com/minneapolis/chohans/chohans_files/_notes/nada-lrg-n.jpg] - source of image Summit Lighthouse Teaching Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; is the "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" (see [[Seven Rays]]), and is the [[Ascended master|Ascended Lady Master]] governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her [[Seven Rays|Ray]] are [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and also [[Ruby (color)|ruby]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also considered a Member of the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]]; she handles the appeals of those on the [[Seven Rays|third ray]].  She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the '''Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha''', on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray.,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and [[The Summit Lighthouse]] Pages 144 and 240&lt;/ref&gt; thus advancing from the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fifth to the sixth level of initiation]].  She primarily serves at ''Arabian  Retreat'' in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], northeast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the [[Indigo]] Cape, as well as with [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], his [[Mother Mary]] and El Samyam, the  Chief of the Arabian Council.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. The Compt de Saint-Germain Press 1935. Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves at ''The [[Rose (color)|Rose]] Temple'', located on the [[etheric plane]] above [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. Designed after the pattern of a [[rose]], with each "petal" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the "Temple of Love" on [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] where Nada once served as a High Priestess.  In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The [[I AM Activity]] and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; She was described as having raised her body and [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascended]] approximately 2,776 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The I AM Discourses''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her "retreat") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]], hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.

==Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==

According to  the [["I AM" Activity]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998. Refers also to the other six Kumars that assist Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the [[Ascended Master]]s (The great beings the original Theosophists called the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]"), such as the [[Master Jesus]], [[Count of St Germain|Saint Germain]], '''Megha Alcorn''' aka '''Megan Sebastian''' on [[Earth]],   [[Kuthumi]], '''Hatton''', [[Gopal Das]] and others are working for the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].  Many theosophists believe the "Masters" utilize the cosmic power of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' to encourage the continual advance of [[civilization]] on [[Earth]] toward higher [[Initiation (Theosophy)|levels of consciousness]]. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the ''[[Great White Brotherhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara is also often referred to as the manifestation of the 'Solar Logos'==

The Theosophist '''A.E. Powell''' stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the ''Lord of the World'') is in continuous telepathic rapport with '''ANNA''' / [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the ''Spirit of the Earth'' (i.e., the ''Planetary Logos'' – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as Prithivi in Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous [[Telepathy|telepathic]] rapport with the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]] (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the [[Sun]]). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the [[Seven Rays]] from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us.  An intermediate trinity of [[Pratyeka]]-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.

==The council chamber of the Lord of the World==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called ''The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World''.  It is here that he regularly meets with [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the '''Maha Chohan''', [[Djwal Khul]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], the [[Master Jesus]] and the other [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing ''The Plan of the Masters'' to bring the [[human race]] to [[Level of consciousness|higher levels of consciousness]].  According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from [[Planetary system|other solar systems]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. 
These include '''The Watcher''' (also called the ''Silent Watcher'' or the ''Great Silent Watcher''), whose function it is to continually watch the [[Akashic records]] and download daily all the [[information]] on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 300&lt;/ref&gt; (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the [[Cosmos]] &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press (Note: the idea that Watcher was part of race of beings posted throughout the Cosmos to fulfill this functions was first promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater and continued by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet) The Great Silent Watchers Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; ); the '''Lords of Karma''' – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three ''Lords of Karma'' but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the '''Karmic Board''' and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: '''The Great Divine Director''' (1st ray), '''The Goddess of Liberty''' (2nd ray), '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (3rd ray), '''Cyclopea''' (4th ray), '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''' (5th ray), '''Lady Master Portia''' (6th ray), and '''[[Kwan Yin]]''' (7th ray).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm Identity of the seven members of the Karmic Board according to the Ascended Master Teachings—The Goddess of Liberty, Kwan Yin, Pallas Athena, The Great Divine Director, Cyclopea, Nada, and Portia:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118080316/http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm |date=18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 153–155 The Karmic Board&lt;/ref&gt;  The Karmic Board decides when [[soul]]s that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their ''soul ray''); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the '''Custodian of the Hall of Records''' (called the '''Keeper of the Scrolls''' in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the ''Hall of Records'', an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the ''Recording Angels'' and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced [[supercomputers]] on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth.  The raw [[data]] is first downloaded daily by ''The Watcher'' from the [[Akashic records]] and fed by him to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records'' and thence forwarded to the ''recording angels'' and their volunteer helpers.  These [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the ''soul ray'' (see [[seven rays]]) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the ''Karmic Board'' if that soul makes an appeal before it.

==Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet==

'''Omri-Tas''', the ''Ruler of the Violet Planet'', is a [[Milky Way Galaxy|Galactic]] level Ascended Master ('''[[Spiritual Hierarchy]], Cosmic Beings''') who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, [http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/elohim_of_aquariuslrg_.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/cosmicos_setimo.htm Source of Image of Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet and his Twin Flame – "Sintonia / Saint Germain". Portuguese language Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is Sanat Kumara's [[Ascended Master Teachings#Violet Flame|violet flame]] supplier.  The violet flame is composed of a special type of [[Occult Chemistry (book)|etheric matter particles]], which may plausibly be called ''violetrons'',  that are capable of cleansing bad [[karma]].   ''Omri-Tas'' rules a planet on the [[etheric plane]] called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred [[light year]]s from Earth.  The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame.  Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|'''Great Central Sun''']] of the Cosmos via the '''Galactic Logos''' to planets in [[Spiritual Hierarchy|Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy)]].  Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the ''Temple of the Violet Flame'' in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 249–253 Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin Creme's views==
[[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the modern esoteric view that [[Nordic aliens]] (like those mentioned by [[George Adamski]] – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot [[flying saucer]]s from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the [[etheric plane]] (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the planet's [[heat]] doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer?  Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where [[crop circles]] appear.  Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an [[Spaceport|astrodrome]] as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus.  Since Shamballa is envisioned as a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped [[mother ship]]s up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from [[Mars]], the [[Moons of Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Sirius]], the [[Pleiades]], and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa.  Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the [[Martians]] (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars),&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 337&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as the "master engineers of the [[solar system]]",&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.

==Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet==
The Master [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by [[Joshua David Stone]] in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]] into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the [[Master Jesus]], under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name '''Sananda''' (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with '''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]]''', flying with '''[[Pallas Athena]]''' in their own flying saucer within the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by ''Commander Ashtar'' to denote his flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood''. Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html The Ashtar Command by Joshua David Stone:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227160744/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity [[Astarte]]/[[Ishtar]]/[[Isis]] and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the [[Satan|Satanic forces]], then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The [[Son of God]]'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Al Daoud.'' [By 'The Pen'. 1930].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]] – she set up her website in 2001.  According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near [[Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet]] who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa.  These are the Masters '''Ballerian''', who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called ''God's Garage''; '''Kumad''', an expert [[linguist]] who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; '''Ashlem''',  a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the [[Akashic records]]; and '''Sutko''', the "space detective", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases.  Elements of the ''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'' sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on '[[shore leave]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) ''The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002'' {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the cosmic beings described above in the mid-level command hierarchy of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatonn and the Photon Belt==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], who began teaching in 1990, '''Hatonn''', an [[android (robot)|android]] [[Pleiadean]] Master who flies aboard the flying saucer ''Phoenix'' (one of the flying saucers of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'', piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master '''Soltec'''), monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]].

He feeds information about events on Earth via [[Subspace radio|subspace relay]] to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records".  However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between Sanat Kumara and the [[Pleiadeans]] in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in [[2012 phenomenon|2012]] through the approaching so-called "[[photon belt]]", said to emanate from the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==

According to many Christians, notably the anti-[[New Age]] author [[Constance Cumbey]], New Age Leaders, including Masters of the [[Illuminati]], are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, ''Externalisation of the Hierarchy'', p.&amp;nbsp;676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, ''The Secret of the Illuminati'', p.&amp;nbsp;1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the "life and the forming intelligence", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (''The New Age Dictionary'', p.&amp;nbsp;172) Further, Sanat Kumara is "the eternal youth from the Planet [[Venus]]". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for [[Satan]] or [[Lucifer]]. (Cumbey, ''Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'') [7].

==Theosophical reply to Christian criticism==
Other [[New Age]] leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.

In the glossary of in the back of the book ''Alchemy'', which [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] claims was dictated to her by [[Kuthumi]], Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuthumi" (dictated to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]) ''Alchemy'' 1982 Summit Lighthouse See glossary at end of book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Sanat Kumara'', although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important "Master" that Blavatsky claimed to have met.  He was first presented, under the name ''Lord of the World'', as the head of the "Masters" by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in his 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in popular culture==

'''[[Panelology]]'''
*Sanat Kumara’s helper ''The Watcher'' was apparently made into a [[Marvel Comics]] character called [[Uatu]] by [[Stan Lee]] in 1963. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher comic books]] have tales about a special race of beings talented at [[information processing]] called ''The Watchers'' spread throughout the [[Cosmos]], and it is believed in Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings that The Watcher belongs to.{{citationeeded|date=January 2016}}
'''Video games'''
*Sanat Kumara is the name of Helena Blavatsky's Noble Phantasm in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. It takes the form of a flying saucer.

'''Share a Coke''' is a multi-national [[marketing campaign]] in for [[Coca-Cola]]. It [[debranding|debrands]] the traditional Coke logo, replacing "Coca-Cola" from one side of a bottle with the phrase "Share a Coke with" followed by a person's name.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; {{primary-inline|date=November 2018}} The campaign, which uses a list containing 250 of the country's most popular names (generic nicknames and titles are also used in some cases), aims to have people go out and find a bottle with their name on it, then share it with their friends.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Share a Coke FAQs|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/faq/products/share-a-coke.html|publisher=[[Coca-Cola]] Great Britain|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lucy|title=Debranding: why Coca-Cola's decision to drop its name worked|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/aug/06/coke-debranding-name-dropping|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2018}} The campaign began in Australia in 2011.{{Citation needed|reason=Not mentioned in body of article; see talk page |date=November 2018}}

==Campaign effectiveness and outcomes==

The Share a Coke campaign was subsequently rolled out in over 80 countries. &lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M. and Ferrell, O.C., ''Foundations of Marketing''  7th ed, Boston, Cengage Learning, p. 416; Wood, N.T. and Muñoz, C.

The campaign received multiple awards at the Creative Effectiveness Lion Awards at Cannes.&lt;ref&gt;''B &amp; T Weekly,'' "Cannes: Share a Coke 'most successful in decades'", ''B &amp; T Weekly'' [Australia], 18 June, 2014, http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/Cannes-Share-a-Coke-most-successful-in-decades&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spary, S., "From Share a Coke to Mad Men: the campaigns that defined Coke under Wendy Clark," ''Campaign Live,'' 17 November, 2015, http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1372962/share-coke-mad-men-campaigns-defined-coke-wendy-clark&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, where the campaign is credited with increasing sales by more than 2%&lt;ref&gt;Esterl, M., "Marketing Campaign That Put First Names on Bottles Reversed Downward Slide," ''Wall Street Journal,'' 25 September, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and according to a piece by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' writer [[Kalle Oskari Mattila]], said to have reversed more than 10 years of decline in Coke consumption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/the-age-of-the-wordless-logo/499166/|title=Why Are So Many of Today’s Logos Wordless?|last=Mattila|first=Kalle Oskari|date=2016-09-08|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the company and its agency has sought ways to extend the campaign while maintaining its relevance. In 2015, the company extended the campaign by increasing the number of names to 1,000. Nicknames such as "bro", "better half" and "sidekick"  were also added to the inventory of names.&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, B., 'Share a Coke' is back with more of your names on bottles,' ''CNN Money'' 14 April, 2014,  http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/14/news/companies/name-share-a-coke-bottle&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company replaced people's names with lyrics from 70 popular songs including ''Lean on Me'' and ''We are the Champions''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlin, W., "Coke Swaps in Song Lyrics for Names in New 'Share a Coke' Campaign," ''AOL Business,'' 31 March, 2016,  https://www.aol.com/article/2016/03/31/coke-swaps-in-song-lyrics-for-names-in-new-share-a-coke-campai/21336287&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the campaign returned to the US with a new variant; holiday destinations. Bottles of coke are labelled with favourite summer holiday spots such as Hawaii, Ibiza, Barbados etc.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, N., "Share a Coke Campaign Returns with Holiday Destinations instead of Names", ''The Drum,'' 19 April, 2017,  http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/04/19/share-coke-campaign-returns-with-holiday-destinations-instead-names&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Coca-Cola collaborated with [[McCann_(company)|Fitzco//Mccann]] and [[Score a Score]] to create over 1000 unique songs based on names found on bottles of Coke. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7865894/coke-share-name-songs-campaign|title=Coke Creates 1,000-Plus Songs for Its 'Share a Coke' Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Financial analysts and advertising experts have used the success of the 'Share-a-Coke' campaign to remind marketers and advertisers of the need to personalise the communications message.&lt;ref&gt; Grimes, T., "What the Share a Coke Campaign Can Teach Other Brands," ''The Guardian (UK),'' 24 July, 2013,  https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/jul/24/share-coke-teach-brands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarver, E., "What Makes the 'Share a Coke' Campaign So Successful?"

[[File:Roma, repubblica, moneta di p. satrienus, 77 ac..JPG|thumb|350px|The she-wolf on a coin of the late Roman republic (c.77 BC)]]
In the [[Founding of Rome|Roman foundation myth]], it was a '''she-wolf''' that nursed and sheltered the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] after they were abandoned in the wild by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]] of [[Alba Longa]]. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the [[Lupercal]], until they were discovered by a shepherd, [[Faustulus]]. [[Romulus]] would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of [[Rome]] since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Wiseman ''Remus'' preface pg xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy.  One legend claims that the [[Hirpini]] people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony,  they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: ''hirpus'').&lt;ref&gt; Strabo Book V Ch.12 (''Loeb'' pg.467) &lt;/ref&gt;  The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the wolf is a sacred animal.  There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the [[Lupercalia]].

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Apollo]]'s mother [[Leto]] is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Aristotle]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|title=History of Animals|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.345.xml?rskey=9mJ3UR&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=S0vjOz|doi=10.4159/DLCL.aristotle-history_animals.1965}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources==
The 3 "canonical" versions of the myth--those of [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]--all draw heavily on [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I 79&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins.  The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius.  Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding.  Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of [[Palatine Hill]].  The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water.  In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal.  Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.

Dionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further.  The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud.  The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.

After a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Greek colonists]] who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I ch.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness.  The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what.  The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land.  The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.&lt;ref&gt; Livy I pp.17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch.  After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away.  It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The three relay accounts wherein the term "lupa" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute.  Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment.  In one, the twins are fathered by [[Hercules]] after he wins a dice game.  Their mother is the unwitting "prize".  In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby [[Gabii]].&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Scan of Figurehead from Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums band 1 (1776).png|thumb|right|Figurehead from the title page of ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums''  Vol. 1 (1776) by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]].  Winckelmann was a pioneer in the study of Graeco-Roman art and [[ancient Roman art]] in particular.  He is center, with the she-wolf suckling the twins and [[Homer]] closest to him.  The [[Sphinx]] and an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan vase]] are in the background.]]

===Earliest representation===
The "Bolsena Mirror" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures.  Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features.&lt;ref&gt; Mazzoni pp173-178&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes its age.  However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340.  The famous [[Capitoline Wolf]] may be of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] or [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Old Latin]] origin.&lt;ref&gt; Tennant p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and [[radiocarbon dating]] has cast doubt on an ancient origin.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina,"[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html ''Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]'' "Rome: the phony She-Wolf wasn't born until the Middle-ages" La Republica. 17 November 2006, accessed 1 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[stele]] from [[Bologna]], dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant.  By 269 BC, the silver [[drachm|didrachm]] is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic "turning of the she-wolf's head" backward and downward at the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], the patron deity of the city, or the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]].  That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces.  She and the twins were featured on the elaborate [[Ara Pacis]], built in honor of [[Augustus]] and dedicated to [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]], the goddess of peace.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.336-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated.  They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own "Roman-ness".&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.339&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.343-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Franks Casket]], an ornately carved, [[Anglo-Saxon]] chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a [[Rune|Runic]] account of the lupercal.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.356 fn.148&lt;/ref&gt; Other Anglo-Saxon [[Undley bracteate|artifacts]] and coins from the same period also feature them.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.357&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Byzantine]]s continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in [[central Asia]] at sites located in modern [[Tadjikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] along with an 8th-century [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.&lt;ref&gt;Compareti p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siena She-Wolf===
The [[Siena|Sienese]] have a traditional tale that the city was founded by [[Senius and Aschius]], another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf.  They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus.  The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance.  However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.

==Lupercalia==
The [[Lupercalia]] was a very ancient festival even during Roman times.  Roman historians speculated as to its origins.  It may be associated with the god [[Lupercus]], the god of [[Pastoralism|shepherds]] and protector of flocks.  Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.

A '''spouse''' is a [[life partner]] in a [[marriage]], [[civil union]], or [[common-law marriage]]. The term is [[gender neutral]], whereas a male spouse is a [[husband]] and a female spouse is a [[wife]]. Although a spouse is a form of [[significant other]], the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.

==Legal status==
{{Further information|Coverture|Marital power}}
The legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly among the jurisdictions of the world. These regulations are usually described in [[family law]] statutes. However, in many parts of the world, where [[civil marriage]] is not that prevalent, there is instead customary marriage, which is usually regulated informally by the community. In many parts of the world, spousal rights and obligations are related to the payment of [[bride price]], [[dowry]] or [[dower]]. Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to male marital partners that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to female marital partners. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) “The Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. August 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings {{cite web |url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824032832/http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and France &lt;ref&gt;Although married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965,[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf] and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. [https://terapiadeparejaweb.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s. In various [[marriage laws]] around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of [[Iran]] states at Article 1105: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311161504/http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on jurisdiction, the refusal or inability of a spouse to perform the marital obligations may constitute a [[ground for divorce]], [[legal separation]] or [[annulment]]. The latter two options are more prevalent in countries where the dominant religion is [[Roman Catholicism]], some of which introduced divorce only recently (i.e. [[Italy]] in 1970, [[Portugal]] in 1975, [[Brazil]] in 1977,  [[Spain]] in 1981, [[Argentina]] in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-12/news/mn-3473_1_divorce-law|title=Divorce Is Now Legal in Argentina but, So Far, Few Couples Have Taken the Break|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paraguay]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies'', by Mala Htun, pp 102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''note''': divorce between 1976-1991 was allowed for non-Catholics&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]] in 1996, [[Chile]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chile introduces right to divorce | date = November 18, 2004 | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malta]] in 2011). In recent years, many Western countries have adopted [[no fault divorce]]. In some parts of the world, the formal dissolution of a marriage is complicated by the payments and goods which have been exchanged between families (this is common where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]]). This often makes it difficult to leave a marriage, especially for the woman: in some parts of Africa, once the bride price has been paid, the wife is seen as belonging to the husband and his family; and if she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf |title=Protecting the Girl Child: Using the Law to End Child, Early and Forced Marriage and Related Human Rights Violations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-29 |website=equalitynow.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}

Oyster, Jane E. Sloan|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412976855|pages=496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of legislation, personal relations between spouses may also be influenced by local [[culture]] and [[religion]], which may promote male authority over the wife: for instance the word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with ''owner'' and ''master''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimum age==
There is often a minimum legal [[marriageable age]]. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/MarryingTooYoung.pdf |title=Marrying Too Young - End Child Marriage |author=United Nations Population Fund UNFPA |date=2012 |website=www.unfpa.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In 2010, 158 countries reported that 18 years was the minimum legal age for marriage for women without parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority. However, in 146 countries, state or customary law allows girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of parents or other authorities; in 52 countries, girls under age 15 can marry with parental consent. In contrast, 18 is the legal age for marriage without consent among males in 180 countries. Additionally, in 105 countries, boys can marry with the consent of a parent or a pertinent authority, and in 23 countries, boys under age 15 can marry with parental consent."

==Procreation==
[[File:Kustodiev Merchants Wife.jpg|thumb|180px|''The Merchant's Wife'' (1918) by [[Boris Kustodiev]]. A wife is a spouse.]]
Although in Western countries spouses sometimes [[Childfree|choose not to have children]], such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world.  In some cultures and religions, the quality of a spouse imposes an obligation to have children. In [[northern Ghana]], for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choosing a spouse==
There are many ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include [[love marriage]], [[arranged marriage]], and [[forced marriage]]. The latter is in some jurisdictions a [[void marriage]] or a [[voidable marriage]]. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/part/10/enacted|title=Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">The '''Texas Aces''' is a name colloquially given to five [[Miss Texas USA]] titleholders who went on to win the [[Miss USA]] beauty pageant in succession from 1985-1989.

Prior to the 1980s, no other state had won more than two [[Miss USA]] pageants in succession (the only two states to win twice in succession were [[Miss Virginia USA|Virginia]] in 1969-1970 and [[Miss Illinois USA|Illinois]] from 1973-1974).  The five Texan Miss USA winners were all coached by "GuyRex", Richard Guy and Rex Holt, who held the Texas franchise from 1975.  The term was first used in 1988 after Gibbs became their fourth consecutive titleholder, with Guy referring to the four queens as "four aces in a deck of cards", with their fifth titleholder, Kim Tomes (1977) as the "wildcard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss USA Contest Rewards Winners, Gurus|publisher=Associated Press|date=1988-03-02|first=Holden|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Gretchen Polhemus became the fifth and final "ace".  The term is still in use.

As well as directing the Texas pageant, GuyRex also acquired the [[Miss California USA]] franchise in 1986.  In 1988, Diana Magaña of California placed first runner-up to Gibbs, the fourth ace.  The two had both undergone extensive preparation by GuyRex, and even lived together prior to the pageant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Miss California |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=1987-08-31|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing Up Beauty / In the months before the Miss USA Pageant, advisers work on Miss California |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=1987-10-01|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five Aces were:
*1985 - [[Laura Harring|Laura Martinez-Herring]] ('''Miss USA''', Semi-finalist at Miss Universe 1985)
*1986 - [[Christy Fichtner]] ('''Miss USA''', 1st runner-up at Miss Universe 1986)
*1987 - [[Michelle Royer]] ('''Miss USA''', 2nd runner-up at Miss Universe 1987)
*1988 - [[Courtney Gibbs]] ('''Miss USA''', Semi-finalist at Miss Universe 1988)
*1989 - [[Gretchen Polhemus]] ('''Miss USA''', 2nd runner-up at Miss Universe 1989)

[[File:Women are Persons-two.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louise McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], Famous Five statue, [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]]]]
'''The Famous Five''', or '''The Valiant Five''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kome|first=Penney|title=Women of Influence: Canadian Women and Politics|year=1985|publisher=Doubleday Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-385-23140-4|pages=31–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=CBF8UvjlN8KiyAGu3IHwDg&amp;id=hBQqAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22valiant+five%22+emily+murphy&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22valiant+five%22|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-fr|Célèbres cinq}}) were five Alberta women who asked the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to answer the question, "Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]], include female persons?" in the case ''[[Edwards v Canada (AG)|Edwards v Canada]].''&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite book | first=Brian| last=Brennan| title=Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference| year=2001| publisher= Fifth House| page= 14| isbn= 1-894004-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five women, [[Emily Murphy]], [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]], [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]], [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], created a petition to ask this question. They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Board of the Governors.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;  In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt; She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Missing 54''' are the soldiers and officers of [[Indian armed forces]] who have been given status of missing in action or killed in action in [[1971 Indo-Pak war]] by government. But they are believed to be alive and imprisoned in various Pakistani jails. Though Pakistan have denied existence of any Indian POW's of 1971 Indo-Pak war; there is strong evidence to suggest that they were captured alive and some or all of them still languish in Pakistani jails. The list of names of these soldiers/officers and their respective service units are as follows.

Missing 55 - Flt Lt Pradeep Vinayak Apte

''(This list was tabled in the Lok Sabha in 1979 by Samarendra Kundu, Minister of State of External Affairs, in reply to unstarred question 6803 raised by Amarsingh Pathawa.)
''
''Note - Initial list consisted of 40 names which later on expanded to 54.''

"If the cause be just and mind be strong,
No force is great, No distance long,
If selfless souls with such a strength,
Face hazards all, they win at length."
THIS is a diary noting in Dr R.S. Suri's diary, father of Major Ashok Suri, captured in the 1971 war. The Army had declared Major Suri as "Killed in action". DR Suri who ran a Yoga Ashram in New Delhi did not believe it. He was sent a helmet with a bullet hole in it and someone else's name written on it. 
 
During the war, the fifth battalion of the Assam Regiment was deployed as part of 191 Infantry Brigade on the west of Munnawar Tawi River in Chambb sector. 10 Infantry Division on the Indian side faced 23 Division on the Pakistani side. 5 Sikh were at Chhamb and were in the middle of the brigade group with 5 Assam and 4/1 Gorkha Rifles on either side. Throughout 4 December Pakistani artillery and PAF were very active in the areas of 5 Sikh and 5 Assam. On Dec 4th Pakistani infantry supported by armour captured Mandiala North after bitter hand-to-hand fighting. On 5 December, 2 tanks of Deccan Horse and a platoon of 5 Sikh recaptured the MandialaBridge. The battle raged on through the day and night of 5 December. These three battalions were subjected to intense shelling and repeated PAF attacks. During this battle, Maj Ashok Suri went missing.
 
Then on December 26, 1974, R.S. Suri received a hand-written note dated December 7, 1974 from his son. The letter contained a slip in which his son had written, "I am okay here." The covering note read, "Sahib, valaikumsalam, I cannot meet you in person. Your son is alive and he is in Pakistan. I could only bring his slip, which I am sending you. Now going back to Pak." Signed M. Abdul Hamid.
In August, 1975, he received another missive postmark dated 'June 14/15/16, 1975, Karachi.' The letter said, "Dear Daddy, Ashok touches thy feet to get your benediction. I am quite ok here. Please try to contact the Indian Army or Government of India about us. We are 20 officers here. Don't worry about me. Pay my regards to everybody at home, specially to mummy, grandfather – Indian government can contact Pakistan government for our freedom." The then Defence Secretary had the handwriting confirmed as Ashok's and changed the official statement from "killed in action" to "missing in action"!
When one gets one's son's letter from a prison in Pakistan, what does one do? Well, R.S. Suri spent the rest of his life making weekly trips to the Ministry of External Affairs where everyone got to know him well. He worked with the government, careful not to involve the media because MEA officials advised him that the missing servicemen were in danger of being killed if they did so. He along with other Delhi-based families formed the Missing Defence Personnel Relative's organization. He used to write to family members based in other parts of the country updating them on what all had transpired. He wrote regularly to the Prime Minister and received regular replies. The overriding concern was that the issue should be taken up whenever the two sides met as a matter of urgency.
In a letter on Jul 15th, 1980, Dr Suri writes from the Delhi Based Next of Kin to the Honourable Minister of External Affairs of Pakistan, Mr Agha Shahi. Talking of the Missing men and welcoming Pakistan's gesture to search for these men, "…….. You will appreciate that the family members have undergone enough agony and misery and some have become mental as well as physical wrecks. The suspense for them is unbearable. ….settle this issue on humanitarian grounds." 
 
In 1983, after what seemed like a breakthrough, the Pakistan government invited family members to Pakistan to identify, if found, its missing defence personnel. This happened after November, 1982 when India and Pakistan signed a protocol on exchange of prisoners when Zia Ul Haque visited India.
On May 30, 1983 – Narasimha Rao said that he would take up at the highest level the visit of the parents of missing defence personnel to Pakistan, since India had allowed the visit of some Pakistani family members to India in 1972. Dr.Suri on behalf of the missing defence families, was assured that Rao would try to facilitate this visit.
 
A delegation of six next-of-kin were allowed to go. It was made very clear that this was a classified visit that the press should not get wind of. There was a feeling of some deal having been done. The families were told to " Get the men back. They may not be in good health but you can nurse them back to health."
The families left on September 12, 1983, Monday for Lahore. This was the first time the Indians had got consular access after 1971. The families got to know that some officials of the MEA will also be going with them toMultan jail. Indira Gandhi in India was meanwhile making aggressive statements in favour of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan &amp; the MQM movement which was irritating Pak. On Sept 14th they flew to Multan. There was a sense of enthusiasm. That day India was supposed to grant Pak officials reciprocal access to 25 Pakistani prisoners at Patiala jail which did not happen. The news came in Pakistani papers that "India goes back on its words".

On Sept 15, 1983, the families visited Multan jail. Dr.Suri was getting hysterical, laughing and crying at the same time. The Pakistani newspaper report of India going back on its word in showing 25 prisoners in Patialajail was at the back of his mind at that time. However, they still clung to the promise and hope that the Indian Govt. had given them.
 
. The jail official who was present commented when Mrs.Tambay was signing her name remarked "Sorry Mrs.Tambay, Tambay is not here." They did not find any of the people they were looking for there. 200 odd prisoners were being offered repatriation by Pakistan, subject to verification during the consular access. The families including Dr Suri wondered when Pakistan had already offered to repatriate these people where was the need for the visit?
 
The family members sat through the consular access process for about 6 people, after which they were asked to go out as their part was done. The jail officials told them that only Zia ul Huq could help us with this category of prisoners.
 
Even after the visit, disheartening though it had been, did not dampen Dr Suri's commitment. He believed the government was doing all it could to get the men back. He never gave up hope. Finally, though his body gave up and he died in 1999 saying, "Perhaps I will finally find peace in the grave."

As per the Geneva Conventions, "Parties to the conflict shall communicate to each other the names of any prisoners of war who are detained till the end of proceedings or until punishment has been completed. By agreement between the parties to the conflict, commissions shall be established for the purpose of searching for dispersed prisoners of war and assuring their repatriation with the least possible delay."

On the Eastern front where there were 93,007 POWs (of which 72795 were soldiers), an agreement was signed by the Foreign Ministers of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan on 30 April 1974 at New Delhi. Thereafter the Pakistani POWs captured on the Eastern front were also repatriated.

SOME OF THE MAIN EVIDENCES

Flight Lt. V.V. Tambay ( the following is often cited as evidence- however if you note, the paper report ison 5th dec. Tambay went missing on 6th dec. SO the newspaper report is wrong.)
Maj Ghosh's photograph published in Time Magazine 
Maj AK Ghosh's photograph was published in Time Magazine dated 27-12-1971
The photograph is proof that Maj AK Ghosh was in Pakistani custody when the war ended on 17 December 1971. He did not return with the POWs in 1972 at the time of the Simla agreement. He may have died in the interim period in a Pakistani jail. Surely there must be some record of that. The Indian and Pakistan governments can work together to find out what happened to such men. Why were some names not included in the POW list is again a moot point. 
A brief note from Maj Ashok Suri followed by another letter in 1975
On 26 December 1974, R S Suri received a hand written note dated 07-12-1974 the words " I am okay here: scribbled on a tiny scrap of paper from Ashok Suri. His father also received letters from a Karachi jail on August 13th 1975 dated June 14/15/16th 1975 stating that there were 20 other officers with him there. The handwriting was authenticated by the Indian government and Indian Ministry of External Affairs officials on many occasions expressed to Dr RS Suri that they believed Ashok Suri was there. 
Why would someone come and send the note to Maj Suri's distraught father if there was no basis for it. What purpose would it serve? 
Mohanlal Bhaskar repatriated on 09.12.1974- writes "Main Bharat ka jasoos tha" or " I spied for India" 
Mohanlal Bhaskar, who was in a jail between 1968 and 1974 and repatriated on 09.12.1974 wrote a book in Hindi ( I was a spy for India) and gave a signed affidavit stating that he met a Col Asif Shafi of Second Punjab regt of Pakistan and a Maj Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra in Fort of Attock imprisoned for conspiring against Bhutto in the infamous "Attock conspiracy" . The Pakistani Major Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra spoke of his befriending a Gill of the Indian Air Force and a Captain Singh of the Indian Army as well as mentioning that there were around 40 Pows of the 1965 and 1971 wars in that jail who had no chances of release. 
In the Attock Conspiracy, several officers of Pakistan's army and air force were arrested on March 30, 1973, on charges of conspiring to overthrow the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The detainees included Major Farooq Adam, Major Nadir Pervez (who later became a federal minister in the Nawaz Sharif government), Brigadier Wajid Ali Shah, Colonel Hamdani, and Major Ayaz Sipra, and a total of 59 officers were declared conspirators. The case is well known as the Attock conspiracy. Fifteen army and four air-force officers were found guilty of conspiracy and were handed jail terms ranging from three months to life.

In this conspiracy, 15 officers were sentenced to terms in prison- among them Maj Ayaaz Ahmed Sipra and Col Asif Shafi. Others such as Farooq Adam ( a Gallian, i.e. from Lawrence school, Ghoraghali) were also sentenced in the Attock conspiracy .

Ayaaz Ahmed and Shafi later apparently moved to the US where Shafi was again traced by Manish Jain ( son in law of Sqn Ldr Jain, another Indian Officer missing and believed to be in Pakistani jails since the 1971 war) and Shafi confirmed to Jain unofficially that he had met Wg Cdr Gill in Attock in 2000 in a telephonic conversation.

A Pakistani General, General Riaz, Governor NWFP who subsequently died in an accident informed Mr Ashwini Kumar, then IG of the Border Security Force as a personal favour to him at the Munich Olympics in 1972 that Major Waraich was being held in Dargai jail, NWFP. 
The earlier sightings in 1972, 1975 seem true even if later sightings may have been mistakes. This is because at that time noone knew of the case of Missing defence personnel. Mohan Lal Bhaskar had no knowledge that some Indian Officers were kept back in Pakistan when he returned and wrote his book. In those days there was no internet or even widespread television. That is why the movement to trace the Indian POWs has remained so strong.

The {{nihongo|'''Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry'''|三十六歌仙|Sanjūrokkasen}} are a group of Japanese poets of the [[Asuka period|Asuka]], [[Nara period|Nara]], and [[Heian period]]s selected by [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] as exemplars of [[waka (poetry)|Japanese poetic ability]]. The eldest surviving collection of the 36 poets' works is ''[[Nishi Honganji Sanjū-rokunin Kashu]]'' ("Nishi Honganji 36 poets collection") of 1113. Similar groups of Japanese poets include the [[Kamakura period]] ''Nyōbō Sanjūrokkasen'' (女房三十六歌仙), composed by court ladies exclusively, and the {{nihongo|''Chūko Sanjūrokkasen''|中古三十六歌仙}}, or Thirty-Six Heian-era Immortals of Poetry, selected by [[Fujiwara no Norikane]] 藤原範兼 (1107–1165). This list superseded an older group called the [[Six Immortals of Poetry]].

Sets of portraits (essentially imaginary) of the group were popular in [[Japanese painting]] and later [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]], and often hung in temples.

[[File:Villainc.svg|thumbnail|An archetypical sinister [[cartoon]] villain (resembling [[Snidely Whiplash]])]]
[[File:Bad guy riff.png|thumb|Theme from ''[[Mysterioso Pizzicato]]'', a [[cliché]] silent movie cue for villainy {{audio|Mysterioso Pizzicato.mid|Play}}]]

A '''villain''' (also known as, "'''baddie'''", "'''bad guy'''", "'''evil guy'''", "'''heavy'''" or "'''black hat'''") is an "[[evil]]" character in a story, whether a [[history|historical]] narrative or, especially, a work of [[fiction]]. 

The villain is a [[antagonist]] (though can be the [[protagonist]]){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} who tends to have a negative effect on other characters. A female villain is occasionally called a '''villainess'''. Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines villain as "a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel; or a character in a play, novel, or the like, who constitutes an important evil agency in the plot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/villain |website=[[Dictionary.com]] |publisher=[[Wayback Machine]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402110610/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/villain |archivedate=2014-04-02 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Image:Villains before going to Work receiving their Lord's Orders Miniature in the Proprietaire des Choses Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Library of the Arsenal in Paris.png|thumb|French villeins in the 15th century before going to work, receiving their Lord's Orders.]]

Villain comes from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] and [[Old French]] ''vilain'', which itself descends from the [[Late Latin]] word '' villanus'', meaning "farmhand",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert K. Barnhart |author2=Sol Steinmetz |title=Chambers Dictionary of Etymology |date=1999 |publisher=Chambers |location=New York |isbn=0550142304 |page=1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of someone who is bound to the soil of a ''villa'', which is to say, worked on the equivalent of a [[plantation]] in [[Late Antiquity]], in Italy or [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David B. Guralnik |title=[[Webster's New World Dictionary]] |date=1984 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0671418149 |edition=2nd college}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2018}} The same etymology produced [[villein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=villain |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/villain |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It referred to a person of less than knightly status and so came to mean a person who was not [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] and [[Politeness|polite]]. As a result of many unchivalrous and evil acts, such as [[betrayal|treachery]] or rape, being considered villainous in the modern sense of the word, it became used as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[C. S. Lewis]] |title=Studies in Words |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107688650 |pages=120-121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xONwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic word "[[churl]]", originally meaning "a non-servile peasant" and denoting the lowest rank of freemen in Saxon society, had gone through a similar degradation, as did the word "[[wikt:boor#Noun|boor]]" which originally meant "farmer".

==Folk and fairy tales==
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of Russian fairy tales, concluded that a [[fairy tale]] had only eight ''[[dramatis personae]]'', of which one was the villain,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Vladimir Propp |authorlink1=Vladimir Propp |title=Morphology of the Folk Tale |date=1968 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0292783760 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions that fell into a villain's sphere were:
* a story-initiating villainy, where the villain caused harm to the hero or his family 
* a conflict between the hero and the villain, either a fight or other competition
* pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain

None of these acts necessarily occurs in a fairy tale, but when any of them do, the character that performs the act is the villain. The villain, therefore, could appear twice: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|84}}

When a character performed only these acts, the character was a pure villain. Various villains also perform other functions in a fairy tale; a witch who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of "guidance" and thus acting as a helper.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

The functions could also be spread out among several characters. If a dragon acted as the villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon's sisters) might take on the role of the villain and pursue the hero.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

Two other characters could appear in roles that are villainous in the more general sense. One is the [[false hero]]: this character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Among these characters are [[Cinderella]]'s stepsisters, chopping off parts of their feet to fit on the shoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Tatar |authorlink1=Maria Tatar |title=The Annotated Brothers Grimm |date=2004 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|W.W. Norton]] |isbn=0393058484 |page=136 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another character, the dispatcher, sends a hero on his quest. This might be an innocent request, to fulfill a legitimate need, but the dispatcher might also, villainously, lie to send a character on a quest in hopes of being rid of him.&lt;ref name="Propp"/&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Villainous foil==
[[File:Wicked Witch of the West W.W. Denslow.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is an example of a literary villain.]]

In fiction, villains commonly function in the dual role of adversary and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to the story's heroes. In their role as an adversary, the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome. In their role as a foil, the villain exemplifies characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero, creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Others point out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish-fulfillment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Das |first1=Sisir Kumar |title=A History of Indian Literature: 1911-1956 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] |isbn=9788172017989 |page=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&amp;pg=PA416 |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes some people identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes. Because of this, a convincing villain must be given a [[characterization]] that provides a [[Base motive|motive]] for doing wrong, as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero. As put by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Roger Ebert |authorlink1=Roger Ebert |title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Movie Review (1982) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan-1982 |website=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=October 11, 2018 |language=en |date=January 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Portraying and employing villains in fiction==
[[Tod Slaughter]] always portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner, with mustache-twirling, eye-rolling, leering, [[evil laughter|cackling]], and [[hand-rubbing]] (however, this often failed to translate well from stage to screen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bryan Senn |title=Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939 |date=1996 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786401758 |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffery Richards |title=The Unknown 1930s: An Alternative History of the British Cinema, 1929-39 |date=2001 |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] |isbn=9781860646287 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brad Warner]] states that "only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Brad Warner]] |title=Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye |date=2007 |publisher=New World Library |isbn=9781577315599 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Bova]] recommends to authors that their works not contain villains. He states, in his ''Tips for writers'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the real world there are no villains. No one actually sets out to do evil... Fiction mirrors life. Or, more accurately, fiction serves as a lens to focus on what they know in life and bring its realities into sharper, clearer understanding for us. There are no villains cackling and rubbing their hands in glee as they contemplate their evil deeds. There are only people with problems, struggling to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Ben Bova]] |title=Tips for writers |url=http://benbova.com/tips2.html |website=Ben Bova |accessdate=2008-12-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821135403/http://benbova.com/tips2.html |archivedate=2009-08-21 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[David Lubar]] adds: &lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a brilliant observation that has served me well in all my writing. (The bad guy isn't doing bad stuff so he can rub his hands together and snarl.) He may be driven by greed, neuroses, or the conviction that his cause is just, but he's driven by something, not unlike the things that drive a hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Darcy Pattinson |title=Villains Don't Always Wear Black |url=http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |website=Fiction Notes |accessdate=2018-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122183445/http://www.darcypattison.com/characters/villains-dont-always-wear-black/ |archivedate=2009-01-22 |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=October 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sympathetic villain===
In an attempt to add realism to their stories, many writers will try to create "sympathetic" villains, the [[antithesis]] to an [[antihero]] called an '''anti-villain'''. These villains come in just as many shapes and sizes as anti-heroes do. Some may wish to make the world a better place but go to antagonistic lengths to do so (such as [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', who commits various crimes in an attempt to complete his goal of creating a cheap, renewable source of energy, and Dr. Horrible in ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]'', who wants to rule the world so that he can solve all of its problems), or may employ a code of honor in fighting his enemies, even if it is to achieve antagonistic goals (examples include Murdock, a secondary villain in the game ''[[Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi]]'', who is honorable, but fights the player's army due to loyalty to his country). Other sympathetic villains may be pushed to antagonistic lifestyles by society's mistreatment of him due to prejudice against something he is a part of (such as [[racism]], as is the case in ''[[American History X]]''), but goes to absurd lengths to achieve the equality he desires, like [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the ''[[X-Men]]'' comics and films. Others may include those manipulated by malevolent and opprobrious forces (such as [[Jack Torrance]] being manipulated by the Overlook Hotel in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''). Plot based video games tend to have two villains where one is sympathetic. This creates a foreseeable plot twist wherein either they die or they switch sides.

[[File:Wandering jew.jpg|thumb|''The Wandering Jew '' by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

The '''Wandering Jew''' is a mythical [[Immortality|immortal]] man whose [[legend]] began to spread in Europe in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;as described in the first chapter of ''Curious Myths of the Middle Ages'' where [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] attributed the earliest extant mention of the myth of the Wandering Jew to [[Matthew Paris]]. The chapter began with a reference to [[Gustave Doré]]'s series of twelve illustrations to the legend, and ended with a sentence remarking that, while the original legend was so 'noble in its severe simplicity' that few could develop it with success in poetry or otherwise, Doré had produced in this series 'at once a poem, a romance, and a chef-d'œuvre of art'. First published in two parts in 1866 and 1868, the work was republished in 1877 and in many other editions.[https://archive.org/stream/curiousmythsofmi00bariuoft/curiousmythsofmi00bariuoft_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original legend concerns a [[Jew]] who taunted [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] on the way to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and was then cursed to walk the earth until the [[Second Coming]]. The exact nature of the wanderer's indiscretion varies in different versions of the tale, as do aspects of his character; sometimes he is said to be a [[Shoemaking|shoemaker]] or other tradesman, while sometimes he is the doorman at [[Pontius Pilate]]'s estate.

==Name==
The earliest extant manuscript with the legend is the ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'' by [[Roger of Wendover]], where it appears in the part for the year 1228, under the title ''Of the Jew Joseph who is still alive awaiting the last coming of Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eQNIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA513] (Latin, ''De Joseph, qui ultimum Christi adventum adhuc vivus exspectat'') p.175 [https://books.google.com/books?id=G-4sAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA157] and {{harvnb|Jacobs|1911|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least from the 17th century the name ''Ahasver'' has been given to the Wandering Jew, apparently adapted from [[Ahasuerus]], the Persian king in the [[Book of Esther]], who was not a Jew, and whose very name among medieval Jews was an ''[[exemplum]]'' of a fool.&lt;ref&gt;David Daube, "Ahasver" ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'' New Series '''45'''.3 (January 1955), pp 243-244.&lt;/ref&gt; This name may have been chosen because the [[Book of Esther]] describes the Jews as a persecuted people, scattered across every province of Ahasuerus' [[Achaemenid Empire|vast empire]], similar to the later [[Jewish diaspora]] in countries whose state and/or majority religions were forms of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/person/334,ahasverus-wandering-jew-ahasver-/|title=Ahasver, Ahasverus, Wandering Jew - People - Virtual Shtetl|publisher=|access-date=16 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112000405/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/person/334,ahasverus-wandering-jew-ahasver-/|archive-date=12 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of names have since been given to the Wandering Jew, including ''Matathias'', ''Buttadeus'', ''Paul Marrane'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy|The Turkish Spy]]|year=1644|volume=Book 3, Letter I}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Isaac Laquedem'' which is a name for him in France and the [[Low Countries]], in popular legend as well as in a novel by [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]].

Where [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]] are spoken, the emphasis has been on the perpetual character of his punishment, and thus he is known there as ''Ewiger Jude'' and ''vechny zhid'' (вечный жид), the "Eternal Jew". In French and other [[Latin languages]], the usage has been to refer to the wanderings, as in French "le Juif errant", in Spanish "el judío errante"&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Judío errante]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2017}} or in Italian "l'ebreo errante"&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Ebreo errante]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2017}} and this has been followed in English from the Middle Ages, as the ''Wandering Jew''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobs|1911|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] he is known as ''Jerusalemin suutari'' (Shoemaker of Jerusalem), implying he was a [[wikt:cobbler|cobbler]] by his trade.

==Origin and evolution==

===Biblical sources===
The origins of the legend are uncertain; perhaps one element is the story in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], who is issued with a similar punishment&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; to wander over the earth, scavenging and never reaping, although without the related punishment of endlessness. According to Jehoshua Gilboa, many commentators have pointed to Hosea 9:17 as a statement of the notion of the "eternal/wandering Jew".&lt;ref name="SweeneyCotter2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sweeney|first1=Marvin Alan|last2=Cotter|first2=David W. |last3=Walsh|first3=Jerome T.|author4=Franke, Chris|title=The Twelve Prophets: Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vOwFysWpogC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=October 2000|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5095-0|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to some sources, the legend stems from Jesus' words given in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#16:28|16:28]]:

{{quote|{{Lang|grc|Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, εἰσίν τινες ὧδε ἑστῶτες, οἵτινες οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου, ἕως ἂν ἴδωσιν τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐρχόμενον ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ.}}

Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]] coming in his kingdom. ([[New International Version]])

Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.|[[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]]&lt;ref&gt;This verse is quoted in the German pamphlet ''Kurtze Beschreibung und Erzählung von einem Juden mit Namen Ahasverus'', 1602.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A belief that the [[disciple whom Jesus loved]] would not die was apparently popular enough in the early Christian world to be denounced in the [[Gospel of John]]:

{{quote|And Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple following whom Jesus loved, who had also leaned on His breast at the supper, and had said, Lord, which is he who betrayeth Thee? When, therefore, Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall he do? Jesus saith to him, If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou Me. Then this saying went forth among the brethren, that that disciple would not die; yet Jesus had not said to him that he would not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?|John 21:20-23, KJV}}

Another passage in the Gospel of John speaks about a guard of the high priest who slaps Jesus (John 18:19-23). Earlier, the Gospel of John talks about Simon Peter striking the ear from a servant of the high priest, named [[Malchus]] (John 18:10). Although this servant is probably not the same guard who struck Jesus, Malchus is nonetheless one of the many names given to the wandering Jew in later legend.&lt;ref name="Italian popular tales"&gt;{{cite book|title=Italian Popular Tales|author=Thomas Frederick Crane|publisher=Macmillan|year=1885|location=page 197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8kFdaz7OVT8C&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hirszenberg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Wandering Jew by [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1899).]]

===Early Christianity===
Extant manuscripts have shown that as early as the time of [[Tertullian]] (c. 200), some Christian proponents were likening the Jewish people to a "new Cain", asserting that they would be "fugitives and wanderers (upon) the earth".&lt;ref&gt;[[Salo Wittmayer Baron]], ''Social and Religious History of the Jews'', 18 vols., 2d ed., Columbia University Press, 1952–1983. Volume titles [https://www.amazon.com/Social-Religious-History-Wittmayer-Baron/dp/0231088566#reader_0231088566]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prudentius|Aurelius Prudentius Clemens]] (b. 348) writes in his ''Apotheosis'' (c. 400): "From place to place the homeless Jew wanders in ever-shifting exile, since the time when he was torn from the abode of his fathers and has been suffering the penalty for murder, and having stained his hands with the blood of Christ whom he denied, paying the price of sin."&lt;ref name="Apotheosis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aurelius Prudentius Clemens|title=Apotheosis|url=https://archive.org/stream/prudentiuswithen01pruduoft/prudentiuswithen01pruduoft_djvu.txt|accessdate=2011-12-22|year=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval legend===
Some scholars have identified components of the legend of the Eternal Jew in Teutonic legends of the Eternal Hunter, some features of which are derived from [[Odin]] mythology.&lt;ref name="SocialReligiousHistoryOfJews_178"&gt;{{cite book|title=A social and religious history of the Jews: Citizen or alien conjurer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXVDceafeiEC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=13 December 2011|volume=11|year=1967|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-08847-3|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In some areas the farmers arranged the rows in their fields in such a way that on Sundays the Eternal Jew might find a resting place. Elsewhere they assumed that he could rest only upon a plough or that he had to be on the go all year and was allowed a respite only on Christmas."&lt;ref name="SocialReligiousHistoryOfJews_178" /&gt;

A variant of the Wandering Jew legend is recorded in the ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'' by [[Roger of Wendover]] around the year 1228.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=910n83JaIREC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Flowers+of+History#PPA512,M1 |title=Roger of Wendover's Flowers of ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dv8KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;cad=0_0#PPA193,M1 |title=Flores historiarum – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-08-07 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For 13c.expulsion of Jews see [[History of the Jews in England]] and [[Edict of Expulsion]].&lt;/ref&gt; An Armenian archbishop, then visiting England, was asked by the monks of [[St Albans Abbey]] about the celebrated [[Joseph of Arimathea]], who had spoken to Jesus, and was reported to be still alive. The archbishop answered that he had himself seen such a man in Armenia, and that his name was Cartaphilus, a Jewish shoemaker, who, when Jesus stopped for a second to rest while carrying his cross, hit him, and told him "Go on quicker, Jesus! Go on quicker! Why dost Thou loiter?", to which Jesus, "with a stern countenance", is said to have replied: "I shall stand and rest, but thou shalt go on till the last day."&lt;!-- needs citation --&gt; The Armenian bishop also reported that Cartaphilus had since converted to Christianity and spent his wandering days [[proselytize|proselytizing]] and leading a [[hermit]]'s life.

[[Matthew Paris]] included this passage from Roger of Wendover in his own history; and other Armenians appeared in 1252 at the Abbey of St Albans, repeating the same story, which was regarded there as a great proof of the truth of the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Paris, ''Chron. Majora'', ed. [[H. R. Luard]], London, 1880, v. 340–341&lt;/ref&gt; The same Armenian told the story at [[Tournai]] in 1243, according to the ''[[Chronicles of Phillip Mouskes]]'', (chapter ii. 491, Brussels, 1839). After that, [[Guido Bonatti]] writes people saw the Wandering Jew in [[Forlì]] (Italy), in the 13th century; other people saw him in Vienna and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1991), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of the doomed sinner, forced to wander without the hope of rest in death till the second coming of Christ, impressed itself upon the popular medieval imagination, mainly with reference to the seeming immortality of the wandering Jewish people. These two aspects of the legend are represented in the different names given to the central figure. In German-speaking countries and [[Russia]] he is referred to as ''{{lang|de|Der Ewige Jude}}'' (the immortal, or eternal, Jew) and ''{{lang|ru-Latn|vechnyy zhid}}'' ({{lang|ru|вечный жид}}), while in Romance-speaking countries he is known as ''{{lang|fr|Le Juif Errant}}''  and ''{{lang|it|L'Ebreo Errante}}'' (French and Italian for ''the Wandering Jew''); the English form, probably because it is derived from the French, has followed the Romance. As well as ''{{lang|es|El Judío Errante}}'' (The Wandering Jew), he is known in Spanish as ''{{lang|es|Juan [el que] Espera a Dios}}'', (John [who] waits for God).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

There were claims of sightings of the Wandering Jew throughout Europe, since at least 1542 in [[Hamburg]] up to 1868 in [[Harts Corner, New Jersey|Harts Corners]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Editorial Summary", ''Deseret News'', 23 September 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Jacobs]], writing in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1911), commented "It is difficult to tell in any one of these cases how far the story is an entire fiction and how far some ingenious impostor took advantage of the existence of the myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|ref=harv |last=Jacobs |first=Joseph |author-link=Joseph Jacobs |wstitle=Jew, The Wandering |volume=15 |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged by an 1881 writer, who however cites no instances, that the supposed presence of the Wandering Jew has occasionally been used as a [[pretext]] for incursions by Gentiles into [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]]s during the late Middle Ages, when the legend was accepted as fact.&lt;ref name="Conway1881"&gt;{{cite book |last=Conway |first=Moncure Daniel |title=The Wandering Jew |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IkMKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |year=1881 |publisher=Chatto and Windus |page=28 |quote=The animus of the revival of the legend is shown by instances in which the Jews' quarters were invaded under rumours that they were concealing the Wanderer. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend about Jews, the so-called "[[Red Jews]]", was similarly common in Central Europe in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voß|first=Rebekka|date=04/2012|title=Entangled Stories: The Red Jews in Premodern Yiddish and German Apocalyptic Lore|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ajs-review/article/entangled-stories-the-red-jews-in-premodern-yiddish-and-german-apocalyptic-lore/5D9E1A03C7776E7E124F000E761E2247|journal=AJS Review|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–41|doi=10.1017/S0364009412000013|issn=1475-4541|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

===17th and 18th centuries===
The legend became more popular after it appeared in a 17th-century pamphlet of four leaves, {{lang|de|Kurtze Beschreibung und Erzählung von einem Juden mit Namen Ahasverus}} (Short Description and Tale of a Jew with the Name Ahasuerus).&lt;ref&gt;This professes to have been printed at [[Leiden]] in 1602 by an otherwise unrecorded printer "Christoff Crutzer"; the real place and printer can not be ascertained.&lt;/ref&gt; "Here we are told that some fifty years before, a bishop met him in a church at Hamburg, repentant, ill-clothed and distracted at the thought of having to move on in a few weeks."&lt;ref&gt;Daube 1955:244.&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[urban legend]]s, particularities lend verisimilitude: the bishop is specifically [[Paul von Eitzen|Paulus von Eitzen]], [[List of the bishops of Schleswig#Lutheran bishops and superintendents|General Superintendent of Schleswig]]. The legend spread quickly throughout Germany, no less than eight different editions appearing in 1602; altogether forty appeared in Germany before the end of the 18th century. Eight editions in Dutch and Flemish are known; and the story soon passed to France, the first French edition appearing in [[Bordeaux]], 1609, and to England, where it appeared in the form of a parody in 1625.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs and Wolf, ''Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica'', p. 44, No. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet was translated also into [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]; and the expression "eternal Jew" is current in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and German, ''{{lang|de|der Ewige Jude}}''. Apparently the pamphlets of 1602 borrowed parts of the descriptions of the wanderer from reports (most notably by [[Balthasar Russow]]) about an itinerant preacher called Jürgen.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Jürgen, ''{{lang|de|2=[https://www.etis.ee/ShowFile.aspx?FileVID=39465Jürgen und der Ewige Jude. Ein lebender Heiliger wird unsterblich]}}'', Arv. Nordic Yearbook of Folklore 64 (2008), 125–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the Wandering Jew appeared in [[Simon Tyssot de Patot]]'s ''{{lang|fr|La Vie, les Aventures et le Voyage de Groenland du Révérend Père Cordelier Pierre de Mésange}}'' (1720).

In England the Wandering Jew makes an appearance in one of the secondary plots in [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]'s Gothic novel ''[[The Monk]]'' (1796). The Wandering Jew is depicted as an exorcist whose origin remains unclear. The Wandering Jew also plays a role in ''[[St. Leon (novel)|St. Leon]]'' (1799) by [[William Godwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Austin Flanders,
''Godwin and Gothicism: St. Leon''. Texas Studies in Literature and Language
Vol. 8, No. 4 (Winter 1967), pp. 533-545.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wandering Jew also appears in two English [[broadside ballad]]s of the 17th and 18th centuries, ''[[The Wandering Jew (ballad)|The Wandering Jew]]'', and ''[[The Wandering Jew's Chronicle]]''. The former recounts the biblical story of the Wandering Jew's encounter with Christ, while the latter tells, from the point of view of the titular character, the succession of English monarchs from William the Conqueror through either King Charles II (in the 17th century text) or King George II and Queen Caroline (in the 18th-century version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=English Broadside Ballad Archive |title=The Wandering Jew |url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/33903/album |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=English Broadside Ballad Archive |title=The Wandering Jew's Chronicle |url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/31447/album |accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

====Britain====
In Britain a ballad with the title ''The Wandering Jew'' was included in [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry|Reliques]]'' published in 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Third edition: Reliques of ancient English poetry: consisting of old heroic ballads, songs and other pieces of our earlier poets, (chiefly of the lyric kind.) Together with some few of later date (Volume 3) - p.295-301, 128 lines of verse, with prose introduction [https://archive.org/stream/reliquesancient00dodsgoog#page/n309/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797 the operetta ''The Wandering Jew, or Love's Masquerade'' by [[Andrew Franklin]] was performed in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/f/Franklin_A/life.htm|title=Andrew Franklin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] had written a poem in four cantos with the title ''The Wandering Jew'' but it remained unpublished until 1877.&lt;ref&gt;The Wandering Jew, A Poem in Four Cantos by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Written in 1810, published posthumously for the Shelley Society by Reeves and Turner, London 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; In two other works of Shelley, Ahasuerus appears, as a phantom in his first major poem ''[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab: A Philosophical Poem]]'' (1813) and later as a hermit healer in his last major work, the verse drama [[Hellas (poem)|Hellas]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Impiety of Ahasuerus: Percy Shelley's Wandering Jew'' Tamara Tinker, revised edition 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Carlyle]], in his ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' (1834), compares its hero Diogenes Teufelsdroeckh on several occasions to the Wandering Jew, (also using the German wording ''{{lang|de|der ewige Jude}}'').

In Chapter 15 of ''Great Expectations'' (1861) by [[Charles Dickens]], the journeyman Orlick is compared to the Wandering Jew.

[[George MacDonald]] includes pieces of the legend in ''Thomas Wingfold, Curate'' (London, 1876).

The minor Cornish poet James Dryden Hosken (1861-1953) concluded "A Monk's Love" (1894) with a long poem "Ahaseurus" which he later adapted into a dramatic monologue included in his heavily revised play "Marlowe" published in "Shores of Lyonesse" 1923.

====North America====
[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s stories "A Virtuoso's Collection" and "Ethan Brand" feature the Wandering Jew serving as a guide to the stories' characters.&lt;ref name="bs"&gt;[[Brian Stableford]], "Introduction" to ''Tales of the Wandering Jew'' edited by Stableford.Dedalus, Sawtry, 1991. {{ISBN|0-946626-71-5}} . (pp.1-25).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 a publisher in North America (Philadelphia, Gebbie) produced ''The Legend of the Wandering Jew, a series of twelve designs by [[Gustave Doré]] (Reproduced by Photographic Printing) with Explanatory Introduction.'' For each illustration there was a couplet, such as "Too late he feels, by look, and deed, and word, / How often he has crucified his Lord".&lt;ref&gt;Gebbie's edition 1873
[http://www.ebay.com/itm/LEGEND-WANDERING-JEW-1873-GUSTAVE-DORE-Illus-1ST-George-Gebbie-Pub-/120982788922?pt=Antiquarian_Collectible&amp;hash=item1c2b22db3a] A similar title was used for an edition under the imprint of Cassell, Petter &amp; Galpin, London, Paris &amp; New York.[[:File:Wandering jew title page.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 a New York publisher reprinted, under the title "Tarry Thou Till I Come", [[George Croly]]'s "Salathiel", which treated the subject in an imaginative form. It had appeared anonymously in 1828.

In [[Lew Wallace]]'s novel ''The Prince of India'', the Wandering Jew is the protagonist.  The book follows his adventures through the ages, as he takes part in the shaping of history.&lt;ref&gt;William Russo's 1999 novella ''Mal Tempo'' details Wallace's research and real-life attempt to find the mythical character for his novel. Russo also wrote a sequel, entitled ''Mal Tempo &amp; Friends'' in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; An American rabbi, [[H.M. Bien]], turned the character into the "Wandering Gentile" in his novel ''Ben-Beor: A Tale of the Anti-Messiah''; in the same year [[John L. McKeever]] wrote a novel, ''The Wandering Jew: A Tale of the Lost Tribes of Israel''.&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt;

A humorous account of the Wandering Jew appears in chapter 54 of [[Mark Twain|Mark Twain's]] 1869 [[travel literature|travel book]] ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark Twain |title=The Innocents Abroad |chapter=Chapter 54 |url=https://genius.com/Mark-twain-the-innocents-abroad-chap-54-annotated |accessdate=2015-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] published in 1820 a book called ''The Wandering Jew''.

====Germany====
The legend has been the subject of German [[poem]]s by [[Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart|Schubart]], [[Aloys Schreiber]], [[Wilhelm Müller]], [[Nikolaus Lenau|Lenau]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|Schlegel]], [[Julius Mosen]] (an epic, 1838), and [[Ludwig Köhler|Köhler]]; of [[novel]]s by [[Franz Horn]] (1818), [[Oeklers]], and [[Levin Schücking|Schücking]]; and of [[tragedy|tragedies]] by [[Ernst August Friedrich Klingemann|Klingemann]] ("{{lang|de|Ahasuerus}}", 1827) and [[Joseph Christian Freiherr von Zedlitz|Zedlitz]] (1844). It is either the Ahasuerus of Klingemann or that of [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]] in his play, ''[[Halle und Jerusalem (play)|Halle and Jerusalem]]'' to whom [[Richard Wagner]] refers in the final passage of his notorious essay ''{{lang|de|[[Das Judentum in der Musik]]}}''.

There are clear echoes of the Wandering Jew in Wagner's ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'', whose plot line is adapted from a story by [[Heinrich Heine]] in which the Dutchman is referred to as "the Wandering Jew of the ocean",&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Heine, ''{{lang|de|Aus den Memoiren des Herren von Schnabelewopski}}'', 1834. See Barry Millington, ''The Wagner Compendium'', London (1992), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; and his final opera ''{{lang|de|[[Parsifal]]}}'' features a woman called Kundry who is in some ways a female version of the Wandering Jew. It is alleged that she was formerly [[Herodias]], and she admits that she laughed at Jesus on his route to the Crucifixion, and is now condemned to wander until she meets with him again (cf. Eugene Sue's version, below).

[[Robert Hamerling]], in his ''{{lang|de|Ahasver in Rom}}'' (Vienna, 1866), identifies [[Nero]] with the Wandering Jew. [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] had designed a poem on the subject, the plot of which he sketched in his ''{{lang|de|[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Fifteenth Book of ''The autobiography of Goethe: truth and poetry, from my own life'' translated from the German by John Oxenford (1848).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyofg02goet/autobiographyofg02goet_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The autobiography of Goethe : truth and poetry, from my own life"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

====Denmark====
[[Hans Christian Andersen]] made his "Ahasuerus" the Angel of Doubt, and was imitated by [[Seligmann Heller|Heller]] in a poem on "The Wandering of Ahasuerus", which he afterward developed into three cantos. [[Martin Andersen Nexø]] wrote a short story named "The Eternal Jew", in which he also refers to Ahasuerus as the spreading of the Jewish gene pool in Europe.

The story of the Wandering Jew is the basis of the essay, "The Unhappiest One" in [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Either/Or]]'' (published 1843 in [[Copenhagen]]). It is also discussed in an early portion of the book that focuses on [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

In the play "Genboerne" (The neighbors across the street), the Wandering Jew is a character (in this context called "Jerusalem's shoemaker") and his shoes will make you invisible when you wear them. The protagonist of the play borrows the shoes for a night and visits the house across the street as an invisible man.

====France====
{{Wikisourcelang|fr|Isaac Laquedem|Isaac Laquedem}}The French writer [[Edgar Quinet]] published his prose epic on the legend in 1833, making the subject the judgment of the world; and {{lang|fr|[[Eugène Sue]]}} wrote his ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Juif errant|Juif errant]]}}'' in 1844, in which the author connects the story of Ahasuerus with that of [[Herodias]]. Grenier's 1857 poem on the subject may have been inspired by {{lang|fr|[[Gustave Doré]]}}'s designs, which were published the preceding year. One should also note {{lang|fr|[[Paul Féval, père]]}}'s ''{{lang|fr|La Fille du Juif Errant}}'' (1864), which combines several fictional Wandering Jews, both heroic and evil, and [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' incomplete ''{{lang|fr|Isaac Laquedem}}'' (1853), a sprawling historical saga. In Guy de Maupassant's short story 'Uncle Judas' the local people believe that the old man in the story is the Wandering Jew.

====Russia====
In Russia, the legend of the Wandering Jew appears in an incomplete epic poem by [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], "Ahasuerus" (1857) and in another epic poem by [[Wilhelm Küchelbecker]], "Ahasuerus, a Poem in Fragments", written in 1832–1846 but not published until 1878, long after the poet's death. [[Alexander Pushkin]] also began a long poem on Ahasuerus (1826) but abandoned the project quickly, completing under thirty lines.

====Other literature====
The Wandering Jew makes a notable appearance in the [[gothic novel|gothic]] masterpiece of the [[Polish language|Polish]] writer [[Jan Potocki]], ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'', written about 1797.&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt;

Brazilian writer and poet [[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]] often used Jewish themes in his writings. One of his short stories, ''{{lang|pt|Viver!}}'' ("To Live!"), is a dialog between the Wandering Jew (named as Ahasverus) and [[Prometheus]] at the end of time. It was published in 1896 as part of the book ''{{lang|pt|Várias histórias}}'' (''Several stories'').

[[Castro Alves]], another Brazilian poet, wrote a poem named "{{lang|pt|Ahasverus e o gênio}}" ("Ahasverus and the genie"), in a reference to the Wandering Jew.

The [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] poet [[János Arany]] also wrote a ballad called "''{{lang|hu|Az örök zsidó}}''", meaning "The everlasting Jew".

The [[Slovenian people|Slovenian]] poet [[Anton Aškerc]] wrote a poem called "Ahasverjev tempelj" ("Ahasverus' Temple").

The Spanish military writer José Gómez de Arteche's novel ''Un soldado español de veinte siglos'' (''A Spanish soldier of twenty centuries'') (1874–1886) depicts the Wandering Jew as serving in the Spanish military of different periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realsociedadgeografica.com/es/pdf/militaresymarinos.pdf José María Gárate Córdoba, "José Gómez de Arteche y Moro (1821-1906)", in ''Militares y marinos en la Real Sociedad Geográfica'', 2006, pp. 79-102]&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

====Latin America====
In Argentina, the topic of the Wandering Jew has appeared several times in the work of [[Enrique Anderson Imbert]], particularly in his short-story ''{{lang|es|El Grimorio}}'' (The Grimoire), included in the eponymous book.  Chapter XXXVII, ''{{lang|es|El Vagamundo}}'', in the collection of short stories, ''[[Misteriosa Buenos Aires]]'', by the Argentine writer [[Manuel Mujica Láinez]] also centres round the wandering of the Jew. The great Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] named the main character and narrator of his short story "The Immortal" Joseph Cartaphilus (in the story he was a Roman military tribune who gained immortality after drinking from a magical river and dies in the 1920s). In ''[[Green Mansions]]'', [[W.H. Hudson]]'s [[protagonist]] Abel, references [[Ahasuerus]], as an archetype of someone, like himself, who prays for redemption and peace; while condemned to walk the earth. In 1967, the Wandering Jew appears as an unexplained magical realist townfolk legend in [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[100 Years of Solitude]]''. A Colombian writer, Prospero Morales Pradilla, in his novel ''{{lang|es|Los pecados de Ines de Hinojosa}}'' (''The sins of Ines de Hinojosa'') describes the famous Wandering Jew of Tunja that has been there since the 16th century. He talks about the wooden statue of the Wandering Jew that is at Santo Domingo church and every year during the holy week is carried around in the shoulders of the Easter penitents around the city. The main feature of the statue are his eyes; they can express the hatred and anger in front of Jesus carrying the cross. In Mariano Azuela's novel of the Mexican Revolution, ''Los de abajo'', (''The Underdogs'') the character Venancio, a semi-educated barber, entertains the band of revolutionaries by recounting episodes from ''The Wandering Jew'', one of two books he had read.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Underdogs|last=Azuela|first=Mariano|publisher=Penguin|year=2008 |origyear=1915|isbn=|location=New York|pages=15, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====French====
[[Guillaume Apollinaire]] parodies the character in "{{lang|fr|Le Passant de Prague}}" in his
collection ''{{lang|fr|L'Hérésiarque et Cie}}'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire,[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22356/22356-h/22356-h.htm#t1 "L'Hérésiarque &amp; Cie"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean d'Ormesson]]: ''{{lang|fr|Histoire du juif errant}}'' (1991)

[[Simone de Beauvoir]]: in her novel ''{{lang|fr|Tous les Hommes sont Mortels}}'' (1946, ''All Men are Mortal''), the leading figure Raymond Fosca undergoes a faith similar to the wandering Jew, who is being explicitly mentioned as a reference.

====German====
In both [[Gustav Meyrink]]'s ''The Green Face'' (1916) and [[Leo Perutz]]'s
''The Marquis of Bolibar'' (1920), the Wandering Jew features as a central character.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Rottensteiner]], "Afterword" in "The Green Face" by Meyrink, translated by Mike Mitchell. Sawtry : Dedalus/Ariadne, 1992, pp.218-224. {{ISBN|0-946626-92-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The German writer [[Stefan Heym]] in his novel ''{{lang|de|Ahasver}}'' (translated into English as ''The Wandering Jew'')&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern University Press (1983) {{ISBN|978-0-8101-1706-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; maps a story of Ahasuerus and [[Lucifer]] raging between ancient times, the Germany of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and socialist [[East Germany]]. In Heym's depiction, the Wandering Jew is a highly sympathetic character.

====Dutch====
The Belgian writer [[August Vermeylen]] published in 1906 a novel called ''{{lang|nl|De wandelende Jood}}'' (''The Wandering Jew'').

====Romanian====
[[Mihai Eminescu]], an influential [[Romanian people|Romanian]] writer, depicts in his romantic fantastic novella ''{{lang|ro|Sarmanul Dionis}}'' a variation. A student follows a surreal journey through the book of [[Zoroaster]], a book seeming to give him God-like abilities. The book is given to him by Ruben, his Jewish master who is a [[philosopher]]. Dan is eventually tricked by Ruben and is sentenced by God to a life of insanity, which he can escape only by [[resurrection]].

Similarly, [[Mircea Eliade]] presents in his [[Bibliography of Mircea Eliade|novel]] ''Dayan'' (1979) a student's mystic and fantastic journey through time and space under the guidance of the Wandering Jew, in the search of a higher truth and of his own self.

====Russian====
The Soviet [[satire|satirists]] [[Ilya Ilf]] and [[Yevgeni Petrov (writer)|Yevgeni Petrov]] had their hero [[Ostap Bender]] tell the story of the Wandering Jew's death at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists in ''[[The Little Golden Calf]]''. In [[Vsevolod Ivanov]]'s story ''Ahasver'' a weird man comes to a Soviet writer in Moscow in 1944, introduces himself as "Ahasver the cosmopolite" and claims he is Paul von Eitzen, a theologian from Hamburg,  who concocted the legend of Wandering Jew in the 16th century to become rich and famous but then turned himself into a real Ahasver against his will. The novel ''Overburdened with Evil'' (1988) by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]] involves a character in modern setting who turns out to be Ahasuerus, identified at the same time in a subplot with [[John of Patmos|John the Divine]]. In the novel ''Going to the Light'' (''{{lang|ru|Идущий к свету}}'', 1998) by Sergey Golosovsky Ahasuerus turns out to be Apostle Paul punished (together with Moses and Mohammed) for inventing false religion.

====Swedish====
In [[Pär Lagerkvist]]'s 1956 novel ''The Sibyl'', Ahasuerus and a woman who was once the [[Delphic Sibyl]] each tell their stories, describing how an interaction with the divine damaged their lives. Lagerkvist continued the story of Ahasuerus in ''{{lang|sv|Ahasverus död}}'' ("The Death of Ahasuerus", 1960).

====English====
In [[O. Henry]]'s story "The Door of Unrest", a drunk shoemaker Mike O'Bader comes to a local newspaper editor and claims to be the Jerusalem shoemaker Michob Ader who did not let Christ rest upon his doorstep on the way to crucifixion and was condemned to live until the Second Coming. However, Mike O'Bader insists he is a [[Gentile]], not a Jew.

[[Robert Nichols (poet)|Robert Nichols']] novella "Golgotha &amp; Co." in his collection ''Fantastica'' (1923) is a
satirical tale where the Wandering Jew is a successful businessman who subverts the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt;

In [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''Helena'', the Wandering Jew appears in a dream to the protagonist and shows her where to look for the Cross, the goal of her quest.

An unidentified Jewish Wanderer appears in ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'', a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] novel by [[Walter M. Miller, Jr.]] first published in 1960; some children are heard saying of the old man, "What Jesus raises up STAYS raised up", implying that he is [[Lazarus of Bethany|St. Lazarus of Bethany]], whom Christ raised from the dead. Another possibility hinted at in the novel is that this character is also Isaac Edward Leibowitz, founder of the Albertian Order of St. Leibowitz (and who was martyred for trying to preserve books from burning by a savage mob). The character speaks and writes in Hebrew and English, and wanders around the desert, though he has a tent on a [[mesa]] overlooking the abbey founded by Leibowitz, which is the setting for almost all the novel's action. The character appears again in three subsequent novellas which take place hundreds of years apart, and in Miller's 1997 follow-up novel, ''[[Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman]]''.

Ahasuerus must remain on Earth after space travel is developed in [[Lester del Rey]]'s "Earthbound" (1963).&lt;ref name="delrey196308"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=del Rey |first=Lester |date=August 1963 |title=Earthbound |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v21n06_1963-08#page/n22/mode/1up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. G. Ballard]]'s short story "The Lost Leonardo", published in ''[[The Terminal Beach]]'' (1964), centres on a search for the Wandering Jew. The Wandering Jew also appears in [[Mary Elizabeth Counselman]]'s story "A Handful of Silver" (1967).&lt;ref&gt;"A Handful of Silver" in ''Half In Shadow'' by Mary Elizabeth Counselman, William Kimber, 1980 (p205-212).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Sadler]] has written a series of books featuring a character called [[Casca (series)|Casca Rufio Longinus]] who is a combination of two characters from Christian folklore, [[Saint Longinus]] and the Wandering Jew. [[Jack L. Chalker]] wrote a five book series called ''The [[Well World]] Saga'' in which it is mentioned many times that the creator of the universe, a man named Nathan Brazil, is known as the Wandering Jew. There is a discussion about the Wandering Jew in the [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein]] novel ''[[Time Enough for Love]]''. The horror novel ''Devil Daddy'' (1972) by [[John Blackburn (author)|John Blackburn]] features the Wandering Jew. &lt;ref&gt;Alan Warren, "The Curse", in S. T.

[[George Sylvester Viereck]] and [[Paul Eldridge]] wrote a trilogy of novels ''My First Two Thousand Years: an Autobiography of the Wandering Jew'' (1928), in which Isaac Laquedem is a Roman soldier who, after being told by Jesus that he will "tarry until I return", goes on to influence many of the great events of history. He frequently encounters Solome (described as "The Wandering Jewess"), and travels with a companion, to whom he has passed on his immortality via a blood transfusion (another attempt to do this for a woman he loved ended in her death).

In ''[[Ilium (novel)|Ilium]]'' by [[Dan Simmons]] (2003), a woman who is addressed as the Wandering Jew plays a central role, though her real name is Savi.

The Wandering Jew is revealed to be [[Judas Iscariot]] in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s distant-future science fiction parable of [[Christianity]], the 1979 short story "[[The Way of Cross and Dragon]]".&lt;!--Please read and contribute to the talk page discussion before adding references to: The Phantom Stranger, Keel Lorenz, Lazarus Long, Nathan Brazil, Hob Gadling (Sandman) or any other character that isn't explicitly named by the author as the Wandering Jew.

The Wandering Jew appears as a sympathetic character in [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s young adult novel ''[[The Homeward Bounders]]''. His fate is tied in with larger plot themes regarding destiny, disobedience, and punishment.  "Ahasver", a cult leader identified with the Wandering Jew, is a central figure in [[Anthony Boucher]]'s classic mystery novel ''Nine Times Nine'' (originally published 1940 under the name H. Holmes). The Wandering Jew encounters a returned Christ in [[Deborah Grabien]]'s 1990 novel ''Plainsong''.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gilmore, "Grabien, Deborah" in ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', edited by David Pringle. St. James Press, 1996. {{ISBN|1-55862-205-5}} (pp.238-39)&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Wandering Jew" is the title of a short poem by Edwin Arlington Robinson which appears in his book ''The Three Taverns''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/threetavernsbook00robiuoft|title=The three taverns; a book of poems|first=Edwin Arlington|last=Robinson|date=1 January 1920|publisher=New York Macmillan Co|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem, the speaker encounters a mysterious figure with eyes that "remembered everything". He recognizes him from "his image when I was a child" and finds him to be bitter, with "a ringing wealth of old anathemas"; a man for whom the "world around him was a gift of anguish". The speaker does not know what became of him, but believes that "somewhere among men to-day / Those old, unyielding eyes may flash / And flinch&amp;nbsp;– and look the other way."

Although he does not appear in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' [1973], the central character, [[Lazarus Long]], claims to have encountered the Wandering Jew at least once, possibly multiple times, over the course of his long life. According to Lazarus, he was then using the name Sandy Macdougal and was operating as a [[confidence man]]. He is described as having red hair and being, in Lazarus' words, a "crashing bore".

===21st century===
====Brazil====
Brazilian writer Glauco Ortolano in his 2000 novel ''Domingos Vera Cruz: Memorias de um Antropofago Lisboense no Brasil'' uses the theme of the Wandering Jew for its main character, Domingos Vera Cruz, who flees to Brazil in one of the first Portuguese expeditions to the New World after murdering his wife's lover in Portugal. In order to avoid eternal damnation, he must fully repent of his crime. The book of memoirs Domingos dictates in the 21st Century to an anonymous transcriber narrates his own saga throughout 500 years of Brazilian history. At the end, Domingos indicates he is finally giving in as he senses the arrival of the Son of Man. 
  
====United Kingdom====
English writer Stephen Gallagher uses the Wandering Jew as a theme in his 2007 novel ''The Kingdom of Bones.'' The Wandering Jew is a character, a theater manager and actor, who turned away from God and toward depravity in exchange for long life and prosperity. He must find another person to take on the persona of the wanderer before his life ends or risk eternal damnation. He eventually does find a substitute in his protégé, Louise. The novel revolves around another character's quest to find her and save her from her assumed damnation.

Sarah Perry's 2018 novel ''Melmoth'' is part-inspired by the Wandering Jew, and makes several references to the legend in discussing the origin of its titular character.

====United States====
American writer Jaxon Reed portrays the Wandering Jew as an assassin for the Westphalian Courts in his 2018 novel ''Cybershot: An Empathic Detective Novel.'' The character stays abreast of technology and uses it against the military and others.

====Uzbekistan====
Uzbek writer Isajon Sulton published his novel ''The Wandering Jew'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://old.ut.uz/eng/kaleidoscope/triumph_of_the_uszbek_author.mgr |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903062822/http://old.ut.uz/eng/kaleidoscope/triumph_of_the_uszbek_author.mgr |archive-date=3 September 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this novel, the Jew does not characterize a symbol of curse; however, they appear as a human being, who is aware of God’s presence, after being cursed by Him. Moreover, the novel captures the fortune of present-day wandering Jews, created by humans using high technologies.

In another artwork, exhibited at Basel in 1901, the legendary figure with the name ''Der ewige Jude'', ''The Eternal Jew'', was shown redemptively bringing the [[Torah]] back to the Promised Land.&lt;ref&gt;Sculpture by [[Alfred Nossig]]. Fig.3.3, p.79 in Todd Presner ''Muscular Judaism: The Jewish Body and the Politics of Regeneration''. Routledge, 2007.

In his painting ''The Wandering Jew'' (1983) [[Michael Sgan-Cohen]] depicts a birdlike figure standing with a black hand pointed to the back of its head, as if it were holding a gun; another hand points down from heaven is using the motif of the Hand of God and suggesting the divine origin of the curse. The birdlike figure depicted is wearing a ''[[Judenhut]]''. The empty chair in the foreground of the painting is a symbol of how the figure cannot settle down and is forced to keep wandering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishlearningworks.org/news/2016/4/19/educators-resources-for-passover|publisher=Jewish Learning Works |title=Educator's Resources for Passover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ideology (19th century and after)==
By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the figure of the "Wandering Jew" as a legendary individual had begun to be identified with the fate of the Jewish people as a whole. After the ascendancy of Napoleon Bonaparte at the end of the century and the emancipating reforms in European countries connected with the policy of [[Napoleon and the Jews]], the "Eternal Jew" became an increasingly "symbolic ... and universal character" as the continuing struggle for Jewish emancipation in Prussia and elsewhere in Europe in the course of the nineteenth century gave rise to what came to be referred to as "the Jewish Question".&lt;ref name="Bein1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bein|first=Alex |title=The Jewish question: biography of a world problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=30 April 1990|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3252-9|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Kaulbach's mural replica of his painting ''Titus destroying Jerusalem'' had been commissioned by the King of Prussia in 1842 for the projected Neues Museum, Berlin, [[Gabriel Riesser]]'s essay "Stellung der Bekenner des mosaischen Glaubens in Deutschland" ("On the Position of Confessors of the Mosaic Faith in Germany") had been published in 1831 and the journal ''Der Jude, periodische Blätter für Religions- und Gewissensfreiheit'' (''The Jew, Periodical for Freedom of Religion and Thought'') had been founded in 1832. In 1840 Kaulbach himself had published a booklet of Explanations identifying the main figures for his projected painting, including that of the Eternal Jew in flight as an outcast for having rejected Christ. In 1843 [[Bruno Bauer]]'s book ''[[The Jewish Question]]'' was published,&lt;ref&gt;"Die Judenfrage", Brunswick, 1843 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2668-bauer-bruno], where Bauer argued that religious allegiance must be renounced by both Jews and Christians as a precondition of juridical equality and political and social freedom. (Moggach, Douglas, "Bruno Bauer", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2010 Edition)[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/bauer/]&lt;/ref&gt; to which [[Karl Marx]] responded by an article with the title "[[On the Jewish Question]]".&lt;ref&gt;''On the Jewish Question'', Karl Marx, written 1843, first published in Paris in 1844 under the German title "Zur Judenfrage" in the Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A caricature which had first appeared in a French publication in 1852, depicting the legendary figure with "a red cross on his forehead, spindly legs and arms, huge nose and blowing hair, and staff in hand", was co-opted by anti-Semites.&lt;ref name="Mosse1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosse|first=George L. |title=The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXd_2_ebSekC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=8 October 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512660-0|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown at the Nazi exhibition ''Der Ewige Jude'' in Germany and Austria in 1937–1938. A reproduction of it was exhibited at [[Yad Vashem]] in 2007 (shown here).

The exhibition had been held at the Library of the [[German Museum]] in Munich from November 8, 1937 to January 31, 1938 showing works that the Nazis considered to be "[[degenerate art]]". A book containing images of these works was published under the title ''The Eternal Jew''.&lt;ref name=HolocaustResearchProject&gt;{{cite web |title=Der ewige Jude: "The Eternal Jew or The Wandering Jew"|url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/derewigejude.html|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been preceded by other such exhibitions in Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Dresden, Berlin and Vienna. The works of art displayed at these exhibitions were generally executed by avant-garde artists who had become recognized and esteemed in the 1920s, but the objective of the exhibitions was not to present the works as worthy of admiration but to deride and condemn them.&lt;ref name="West2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Shearer |title=The visual arts in Germany 1890-1937: Utopia and despair|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCSsgp4V7eYC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-5279-8|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal in popular media==

===Stage===
[[Fromental Halévy]]'s opera ''[[Le Juif errant (opera)|Le Juif errant]]'', based on the novel by [[Eugène Sue|Sue]], was premiered at the [[Paris Opera]] ([[Salle Le Peletier]]) on 23 April 1852, and had 48 further performances over two seasons. The music was sufficiently popular to generate a ''Wandering Jew [[Mazurka]]'', a ''Wandering Jew [[Waltz]]'', and a ''Wandering Jew [[Polka]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, (1991), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Hebrew-language play titled ''The Eternal Jew'' premiered at the Moscow [[Habimah Theatre]] in 1919 and was performed at the Habima Theatre in New York in 1926.&lt;ref name="Nahshon2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nahshon|first=Edna |title=Jews and shoes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx--Mja-DJUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=15 September 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-050-5|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Wolfit]] made his debut as the Wandering Jew in a stage adaptation in London in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Harwood|Harwood, Ronald]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36992 "Wolfit , Sir Donald (1902–1968)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 14 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The play ''Spikenard'' (1930) by [[C. E. Lawrence]], has the Jew wander an uninhabited Earth along with [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] and the [[Impenitent thief]].&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt; [[Glen Berger]]'s 2001 play ''[[Underneath the Lintel]]'' is a monologue by a Dutch librarian who delves into the history of a book that is returned 113 years overdue and becomes convinced that the borrower was the Wandering Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alley Theatre |url=http://www.AlleyTheatre.org/Alley/Underneath_the_Lintel_EN.asp?SnID=504862558 |title=Underneath the Lintel |publisher=Alley Theatre |date=2008-08-08 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
There have been several films on the topic of ''The Wandering Jew'':
* 1904 silent film called ''Le Juif Errant'' by [[Georges Méliès]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media| publisher = Star Film Company| people = Georges Méliès(Director)| title = Le Juif Errant| accessdate = 2018-05-13| date = 1904| url = https://archive.org/details/LeJuifErrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1923 saw ''[[The Wandering Jew (1923 film)|The Wandering Jew]]'', a British [[silent film]] by [[Maurice Elvey]] from the basis of [[E. Temple Thurston]]'s play, starring [[Matheson Lang]]. The play had been produced both in Twickenham, [[London]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1921, the latter co-produced by [[David Belasco]]. The play, as well as the two films based upon it, attempts to tell the legend literally, taking the Jew from [[Biblical]] times all the way to the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. 
* Elvey also directed the 1933 remake ''[[The Wandering Jew (1933 film)|The Wandering Jew]]'', with [[Conrad Veidt]] in the title role; the film was so popular it broke box office records at the time. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Film Daily|date=24 January 1935|publisher=Wid's Films and Film Folk, inc.|page=242|url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily67wids#page/n241/mode/2up/search/%2238+years%22|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1933, the Jewish Talking Picture Company released a [[Yiddish]]-language film entitled ''[[The Eternal Jew (1933 film)|The Eternal Jew]]''. 
* In 1940, there was a propaganda "documentary" film made in Germany entitled ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der Ewige Jude]]'' (''The Eternal Jew''), reflecting [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] [[anti-Semitism]], linking the legend with alleged Jewish malpractices over the ages. 
* Still another film version of the story, made in Italy in 1948, starred [[Vittorio Gassman]].
* In the 1988 film ''[[The Seventh Sign]]'' the Wandering Jew appears as Father Lucci, who identifies himself as the centuries old Cartaphilus, [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate's]] porter, who took part in the scourging of [[Jesus]] before his crucifixion.
* The 2000 [[horror film]] ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' and its sequels equate the Wandering Jew with [[Judas Iscariot]].

===Television===
* In the third episode of the first season of [[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|''The Librarians'']], the character Jenkins mentions the Wandering Jew as an "immortal creature that can be injured, but never killed".
* In the [[Fargo (Season 3)|third season]] of the FX series [[Fargo (TV series)|''Fargo'']], a character named Paul Marrane appears to three major characters. He acts as a source of counsel to two of them (one of whom he provides a chance at redemption), while forcing the third to confront his past involvement in numerous killings.
* In the Japanese manga and accompanying anime series ''[[The Ancient Magus' Bride]]'', the Wandering Jew is represented in the antagonist of Cartaphilus. In his search to end his eternal suffering, Cartaphilus serves as a nuisance to the progression of Chise's training.
* In the TV series ''Peaky Blinders'' (BBC2) Jewish gangster, Alfie solomons, played by Tom Hardy, described himself as "The Wandering Jew".

===Comics===
The [[DC Comics]] character [[Phantom Stranger]], a mysterious hero with paranormal abilities, was given four possible origins in an issue of ''[[Secret Origins]]'' with one of them identifying him as the Wandering Jew. He now dedicates his time to helping mankind, even declining a later offer from God to release him from his penance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= [[Mike W. Barr|Barr, Mike W.]]|penciller= Aparo, Jim|inker= Aparo, Jim|story= Tarry Till I Come Again|title= Secret Origins|volume= 2|issue= 10|date= January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Deitch's ''[[A Shroud for Waldo]]'' serialized in weekly papers such as ''[[New York Press]]'' and released in book form by [[Fantagraphics]], the hospital attendant who revives Waldo as a hulking demon so he can destroy the AntiChrist, is none other than the Wandering Jew. For carrying out this mission, he is awarded a normal life and, it is implied, marries the woman he just rescued. Waldo, having reverted to cartoon cat form, is also rewarded, finding it in a freight car.

In Neil Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman]]'' comic series, the character Hob Gadling represents the archetypal Wandering Jew. Later, the character Johanna Constantine remarks on a rumor that The Devil and the Wandering Jew meet once every hundred years in a tavern, further drawing out the connection.

In Kore Yamazaki's manga ''[[The Ancient Magus' Bride]]'', the character Cartaphilus, also known as Joseph, is a mysterious being that looks like a young boy, but is much older. He is dubbed "The Wandering Jew" and is said to have been cursed with immortality for throwing a rock at the Son of God. It is later revealed that Joseph and Cartaphilus used to be two different people until Joseph fused with Cartaphilus in an attempt to remove his curse, only to become cursed himself.

In various [[Pokémon]] media, including the ''[[Pokémon Adventures]]'' manga and the [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']] games, a character named AZ is cursed with eternal life and wanders in search of his lost Pokémon for the part he played in a war, thus sharing similar qualities with the Wandering Jew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/AZ AZ in ''Bulbapedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;
