The '''Libyan hostage situation''' began on the morning of the [[Murder of Yvonne Fletcher|murder of WPC Fletcher]], 17 April 1984 and lasted until 5 February 1985 (294 days). In accordance with the hostage release agreement, reporting on the incident was restricted until the fall of Gadaffi in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Timeline ==

'''March 1984'''

Four Libyan nationals were arrested on charges following explosions at Manchester and Heathrow airports in the UK and were remanded in custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_v87/ai_4679424/ Libya – statement by Larry Pressler in a session of the UN General Assembly on November 19, 1986], [[CBS]] Interactive Business Network Resource Library&lt;/ref&gt;

'''17 April 1984'''

[[Murder of Yvonne Fletcher|WPC Yvonne Fletcher]] was hit by a bullet from a burst of machine-gun fire from within the Libyan Peoples' Bureau (Libyan Embassy) in St James's Sq., London. She died shortly afterwards.

That evening, Doug Ledingham, the airport manager for British Caledonian Airways at Tripoli Universal Airport, Libya, was arrested by soldiers.

'''17 to 27 April'''

There was a standoff between the Libyan and British governments over the pursuit of who shot WPC Fletcher. The standoff resulted in the breaking of diplomatic relations by Britain with Libya, and the return to Libya under diplomatic immunity of the occupants of the Libyan Peoples' Bureau in London.  Rumours abounded at the time as to the fate of the person who is alleged to have fired the fatal shots from the Libyan People's Bureau. In 1986, a British businessman who had worked for Colonel Gaddafi's regime reported WPC Fletcher's killer had been hanged as soon as he returned to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=BBC | series = On this Date | chapter = Stories | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/17/newsid_2488000/2488369.stm | title = Libyan embassy shots kill policewoman | date = 17 April 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the breaking of diplomatic relations with Libya, the British Embassy in Tripoli was evacuated by the British and ransacked by the Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher=BBC | series = On this Date | chapter = Stories | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/27/newsid_2502000/2502565.stm | title = 1984: Libyan embassy siege ends | date =  27 April 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; A skeleton staff of British diplomats took up office in the Italian Embassy.

'''14–16 May 1984'''

Four further British men in Libya were rounded up and detained as hostages against the four arrested Libyan nationals in Britain by those claiming to be officials of the [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi regime]]. The men in order of capture were: Michael Berdinner, Alan Russell, Malcolm Anderson and Robin Plummer. At first, Allen Russell and Malcolm Anderson were held at a separate location where they were questioned and beaten. Ledingham, Berdinner and Plummer (Plummer in solitary confinement) were in the same facility, the Italian Mansion, a building approximately 400 yards distant from the Italian Embassy.

'''12 June 1984'''

A month after being taken hostage, the five men were allowed a meeting with the British Second Consul, George Anderson, who was able to offer only pastoral care and contact with home, but no suggestion of release. It was clear by this time, however, that the men were being held as hostages by one of Col Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees, in defiance of international law. Return to their respective prisons was followed by little or no improvement in the hostages' circumstances.

'''19 July 1984'''

A second meeting with George Anderson resulted in all the hostages being put into one location, the Italian Mansion, and being fed an improved diet and given medical attention. This improvement in circumstances was accompanied by a slow but inexorable descent into gloom of the hostages isolated from all news of the outside world.

Meanwhile, in Britain, unbeknownst to the hostages, their families, notably Pat Plummer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Selena Scott]]|date= 3 September 1984|title= Selena Scott interviews Pat Plummer|medium= Television production|publisher=[[ITN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carole Russell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=October 1984 |title= After Carole's visit to Libya|medium= Television production|publisher=[[Anglia News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; were working tirelessly with [[Kate Adie]] of the BBC and [[Brent Sadler]] of ITN to keep the hostages' plight in the media to keep the situation in the news and the profile high on the government's agenda. By now, the families were being kept up to date on a daily basis by contacts within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London as to the stalemate between Libya and Britain, with a continual decline in international relations between Libya and most of the rest of the world.

'''Summer 1984'''

In London, a committee in parliament was held to determine whether or not what the British government had done over the Libyan hostage situation was reasonable.  The committee concluded that in the circumstances, the British government had done all it reasonably could in the light of what little was known at the time.

'''7 August 1984'''

The Libyans allowed family members to visit the hostages.  These visits brought unofficial news of the, as yet, publicly undisclosed involvement of [[Terry Waite]], the Special Envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, of the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Waite]], ''Taken on Trust'', 1993, Hodder and Stoughton, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1 September 1984'''

Doug Ledingham and George Bush, another prisoner, arrested and detained on bona fide charges unrelated to the Libyan hostage situation, were freed and allowed home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=2 September 1984 |title= Doug Ledingham returns home, Pat Plummer insists the government do more|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of their release, British television news was granted access to and showed the world for the first time, detail of the hostage situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Brent Sadler]]|date=1 September 1984 |title= New moves could help the four Britons held in Libya and the two who come home tomorrow|medium= Television production|publisher=[[ITN News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''17 October 1984'''

Two of the wives of the hostages, Pat Plummer and Carole Russell, attended a meeting with the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The two wives petitioned for a representative of the British Government to go to Libya and start negotiations for the release of the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Tony Scase|date=17 October 1984 |title= Post meeting with Margaret Thatcher|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC Look East]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting was soon followed by the arrival in Libya of Terry Waite.

'''21 October 1984'''

Alan Russell and Malcolm Anderson were removed from the Italian Mansion and taken to the Libyan courts, where they were charged with transporting state secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=21 October 1984 |title= Russell and Anderson charged with espionage|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''10–18 November 1984'''

Terry Waite was in Libya. The hostage situation showed no signs of thawing, in spite of national and international efforts to secure the release of the hostages and the intervention at a pastoral level of Waite.

'''13–14 December 1984 '''

Allen Russell was placed on trial and charged with sharing state secrets with British journalists. Robin Plummer seized the opportunity to speak to the press post being question and states his innocence and makes a plea for warm clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=14 December 1984 |title= Wives plead to Gaddafi and Plummer pleas for warm clothes|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC Look East]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''24 December 1984'''

The four men were confirmed as political hostages by Gaddafi. Waite held a Christmas carol service with the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=24 December 1984 |title= A difficult Christmas|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''6 January 1985'''

Col Gaddafi himself placed the matter of the remaining hostages before the members of the Basic and General Peoples' Congresses, the system of democracy prevalent in Libya at the time, for a decision on the release of the hostages.

'''1 February 1985'''

Then WPC Fletcher's memorial was unveiled temporarily disrupting negotiations and sent a very clear message to the Libyans.

'''5 February 1985'''

The Congresses voted by an overwhelming majority to release the hostages. But there were conditions to the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= [[Kate Adie]]|date=5 February 1985 |title= Press Conference in Libya to release hostages|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]] Breakfast}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release was however subject to a few days' delay, for undisclosed reasons.

'''7 February 1985'''

After almost nine months (294 days), the hostages arrived back in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=7 February 1985 |title= Former Hostages arrive at Gatwick|medium= Television production|publisher=[[BBC]] Breakfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions for release ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}

The conditions were as follows:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
#Britain should undertake not to support "stray dogs" (political exiles),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/28/politics.libya Gadaffi still hunts 'stray dogs' in UK], Martin Bright, ''[[The Observer]]'', Sunday 28 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}} to hand them over, and to stop antagonistic acts against the Libyan people;
#British Government to work for release of the Libyan prisoners in the UK;
#The Anglican Church to undertake to look after Libyan students in Britain and to endeavour to secure release of Libyan prisoners;
#British Government to stop anti-Libyan propaganda channelled through British media;
#Her Majesty's Government to undertake to treat Libyans in accordance with international law.

== Aftermath ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
An interpretation of Condition 4 could include a complete absence in any British-controlled media of any reference to the Libyan hostage situation for fear that any such reference might be construed by the Libyan authorities as a breach of Condition 4. In accordance with this interpretation, there has been almost no reference to the hostage situation in literature since the time of the release. Most references that state the history of Libya at the time make reference to the murder of WPC Fletcher and then make no reference whatsoever to the hostage situation, skipping instead to the bombing of Libya by the Americans in 1986.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== History ==
The organisation was founded as the '''32 County Sovereignty Committee'''&lt;ref name="p28" /&gt; on 7 December 1997 at a meeting of like-minded [[Irish republican]]s in [[Finglas]] in Dublin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Those present were opposed to the direction taken by [[Sinn Féin]] and other mainstream republican groups in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], which would lead to the [[Belfast Agreement]] (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) the following year. The same division in the republican movement led to the paramilitary group now known as the [[Real IRA]] breaking away from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] at around the same time.

Most of its founders had been members of Sinn Féin; some had been expelled from the party for challenging the leadership's direction, while others felt they had not been properly able to air their concerns within Sinn Féin at the direction its leadership had taken. [[Bernadette Sands McKevitt]],  wife of [[Michael McKevitt]] and a sister of [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|hunger striker]] [[Bobby Sands]], was a prominent member of the group until a split in the organisation.

The name refers to the 32 [[counties of Ireland]] which were created during the [[Lordship of Ireland|Lordship]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. With the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1920–22, twenty-six of these counties formed the [[Irish Free State]] which became the [[Republic of Ireland]]; the remaining six counties of [[Northern Ireland]] remain part of the [[United Kingdom]].

Before the referendums on the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]], the 32CSM lodged a legal submission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.32csm.info/UNsubmission.html|title=Submission to the UN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the United Nations challenging British sovereignty in Ireland. The referendums were opposed by the 32CSM, but were supported by 71% of voters in Northern Ireland and by 94% in the Republic of Ireland. In November 2005 the 32CSM launched a political initiative titled ''Irish Democracy, A Framework For Unity.''

On 24 May 2014 [[Gary Donnelly (Irish republican)|Gary Donnelly]], a member of the 32 Country Sovereignty Movement, was elected to the [[Derry]] and [[Strabane]] super council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27559217 |title=Gary Donnelly elected in Derry &amp; Strabane |publisher=BBC |date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/dissident-republican-gary-donnelly-takes-derry-and-strabane-super-council-seat-and-faces-ira-bomb-motion-30348381.html |title=Dissident republican Gary Donnelly takes Derry and Strabane super council seat and faces IRA bomb motion |publisher=The Belfast Telegraph |date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014 a delegation from the 32 County Sovereignty Movement travelled to Canada, to take part in a six-day speaking tour. On arrival the delegation was detained and refused entry into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ulsterherald.com/2014/07/28/canadian-detention-a-political-decision-francis-mackey/ |title=Canadian detention a ‘political decision’ – Francis Mackey |publisher=Ulster Herald |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
[[File:Easter Rising Dublin Parade - 25 April 2010 -www.keepvid.com-.ogv|thumb |200px |32CSM march to commemorate [[Easter Rising]], Dublin, April 2010]]
The 32CSM has protested against what it calls "internment by remand" in both jurisdictions in Ireland.

Other protests include ones against former [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) leader [[Ian Paisley]] in [[Cobh]], County Cork, against former British Prime Minister [[John Major]] being given the Keys to [[Cork city]], against a visit to the Republic of Ireland by [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] head Sir [[Hugh Orde]], and against the Israeli [[Palestinian territories|occupation of Palestine]] and Anglo-American [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]].

In 2015 the 32CSM organised a demonstration in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] in solidarity with the men convicted of shooting Constable Stephen Carroll, the first police officer to be killed in Northern Ireland since the formation of the PSNI. The organisation says the "Craigavon Two" are innocent and have been victims of a [[miscarriage of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/video-tempers-flare-at-irish-republican-protest-in-dundee-1.804762|title=VIDEO: Tempers flare at Irish republican protest in Dundee|last=Dinnie|first=Steven|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The 32 County Sovereignty Movement has often been critical of the Real  IRA's military actions.&lt;ref&gt;After the [[Omagh bombing|Omagh bomb attack]], the organisation issued a statement saying "the killing of innocent people could not be justified," and that it was "deeply saddened and devastated" by the attack. From [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/152512.stm "Links with terror group rejected"], BBC News, 17 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; However the group is currently considered a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist organization]] (FTO) in the [[United States]], because the group is considered to be inseparable from the Real IRA, which is designated as an FTO.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm|title=Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)|website=2001-2009.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1330611/Real-IRA-designated-terrorists.html |title=Real IRA designated terrorists |publisher=The Telegraph |date=17 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a briefing in 2001 a spokesman for the [[US Department of State]] stated that "evidence provided by both the British and Irish governments and open source materials demonstrate clearly that the individuals who created the Real IRA also established these two entities to serve as the public face of the Real IRA. These alias organizations engage in propaganda and fundraising on behalf of and in collaboration with the Real IRA." The US Department of State's designation made it illegal for Americans to provide material support to the Real IRA, requires US financial institutions to block the group's assets and denies alleged RIRA members visas into the US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2001/2922.htm|title=Real IRA Designation (Taken question)|website=2001-2009.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Ireland==
The 32CSM also operates outside of the island of Ireland to some extent. The [[Michael Gaughan (Irish republican)|Gaughan]]/[[Frank Stagg (Irish republican)|Stagg]] Cumann covers England, Scotland and Wales and has an active relationship of mutual promotion with a minority of British [[hard left]] groups, including the [[Anti-Fascist Action|Anti-Fascist Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gaughanstaggcumann.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/gaughanstagg-cumann32csm-continues-to.html|publisher=Gaughan Stagg Cumann - 32CSM|title=Gaughan/Stagg Cumann(32CSM) continues to build on the unity between Antifascists and Irish Republicans|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=1542014856068531&amp;story_fbid=1544124079190942|publisher=Facebook|title=Gaughan Stagg Cumann - 32CSM |date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2012/07/497944.html?c=on|publisher=Liverpool Antifascists|title=Antifascist Solidarity Needed in Liverpool on Saturday 21st July!|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The James Larkin Republican Flute Band (founded in 1996) in [[Liverpool]] and the [[West of Scotland Band Alliance]] (founded in 1979)–the largest section of which is the [[Glasgow]]-based Parkhead Republican Flute Band–are also supporters of the 32CSM&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowe|2013|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (the larger flute band communities in these areas tend to be aligned to [[Sinn Féin]] instead).

'''Aaya Ram Gaya Ram''' expression in politics of [[India]] means frequent floor-crossing by legislatures. The term was coined when [[Gaya Lal]] a [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from [[Haryana]] in 1967 changed party thrice in a fortnight first from the [[Indian National Congress]] to United Front, back to Congress and then within nine hours to United Front again. When Gaya Lal decided to quit the United Front and join the Congress, then Congress leader [[Rao Birendra Singh]] brought him to [[Chandigarh]] press and declared "Gaya Ram was now Aya Ram". It became the subject of numerous jokes and cartoons. In 1985 the Constitution amended the anti-defection act. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/here-is-all-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-anti-defection-law/story-49d09jR4iSNmKI5w83u2IL.html&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent such defections.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-21/chandigarh/30542163_1_bhajan-lal-bansi-lal-vinod-bhayana&lt;/ref&gt; It was included in constitution by Rajiv Gandhi Government as the tenth schedule of Indian constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10332">An '''administrative centre''' is a seat of regional administration or [[local government]], or a [[county town]], or the place where the central administration of a [[Township|commune]] is located.

In countries which have French as one of their administrative languages (such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland or many African countries) and in some other countries (such as Italy, cf. cognate ''capoluogo''), a '''chef-lieu''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛfljø}}, plural form ''chefs-lieux'' (literally "chief place" or "head place"), is a town or city that is pre-eminent from an administrative perspective. The ‘f’ in chef-lieu is pronounced, in contrast to chef-d'oeuvre where it is mute. 

==Algeria==
The capital of an [[provinces of Algeria|Algerian Province]] is called a '''chef-lieu'''. The capital of a [[districts of Algeria|district]], the next largest division, is also called a '''chef-lieu'''. While the capital of the lowest division, the [[municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]], is called '''agglomeration de chef-lieu''' (chef-lieu  [[Urban agglomeration|agglomeration]]) and is abbreviated as '''A.C.L.'''

==Belgium==
The '''chef-lieu''' in Belgium is the administrative centre of each of the ten [[Provinces of Belgium]].  Three of these cities also give their name to their province ([[Antwerp]], [[Liège]] and [[Namur (city)|Namur]]).

==Luxembourg==

Luxembourg is divided into two judicial [[arrondissement]]s (Luxembourg City, Diekirch), three administrative districts (Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher), four electoral circonscriptions (constituencies), twelve [[Cantons of Luxembourg|canton]]s and one hundred and five communes (municipalities; Luxembourgish: ''Gemengen'').

Arrondissements, districts and cantons have each a '''chef-lieu''' and are named after it. The same is true for each commune which is composed of more than one town or village. Usually (with a few exceptions), the commune is named after the communal chef-lieu.

==France==
The '''chef-lieu of a [[departments of France|département]]''' is known as the ''[[Prefectures in France|préfecture]]''. This is the town or city where the [[prefect]] of the départment (and all services under his/her control) is situated, in a building known as the [[prefecture]]. In every [[French region]], one of the départments has pre-eminence over the others, and the prefect carries the title of ''Prefect of region X…, Prefect of Department Z…'' and the city where the regional prefect is found is known  as ''chef-lieu of the  region'' or,  more commonly, ''Regional prefecture''. The services are, however, controlled by the prefecture of the départment.  

The '''chef-lieu of an [[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]''', commonly known as the ''[[Subprefectures in France|sous-préfecture]]'' is the city or town where the sub-prefect of the arrondissement (and the services directly under his/her control) is situated, in a building called the [[sub-prefecture]]. The arrondissement where the département prefecture is located does not normally have a sub-prefect or sub-prefecture, the administration being devolved usually to the ''Secretary-general of the departmental prefecture'', who functions as sub-prefect for the arrondissement.  

The '''chef-lieu of a [[cantons of France|canton]]''' is usually the biggest city or town within the canton, but has only a nominal role. No specific services are controlled by it.  In past decades, there was always a [[Gendarmerie]], a treasurer and a justice of the peace.  

The '''chef-lieu of a [[communes of France|commune]]''' is the principal area of the town or city that gives the commune its name, the other areas of the town being called hamlets. French typographers will use a capital for the ‘Le’ or ‘La’ preceding the name of places having ‘chef-lieu of town’ status, and lowercase ‘le’ or ‘la’ for hamlets.

==Jordan==
In the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the administrative centres are known as "chief towns" or [[Nahias of Jordan|''nahias'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Annex B: Analysis of the municipal sector |work=Third Tourism Development Project, Secondary Cities Revitalization Study |date=24 May 2005 |page=4 |publisher=Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan |url=http://www.mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052114/http://mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-date=19 April 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nahias may be in charge of a sub-district (''qda''), a district (''liwa''), or a [[Governorates of Jordan|governorate]] (''muhafazah'').

==New Caledonia==
The '''chef-lieu''' indicates the principal city of the provinces of New Caledonia. So [[Nouméa]] is the chef-lieu of South Province. But the chef-lieu can also mean the principal area within a town. So [[Wé]] is part of the town of [[Lifou]], but is the chef-lieu of Lifou.  In the [[Loyalty Islands]] and the other islands, the name of the chef-lieu differs from that of the name of the town. For the towns of the mainland, the chef-lieu has the same name as the town. Nouméa is a town composed only of Nouméa.

==Francophone West Africa==
Many of the West African states which gained independence from [[France]] in the mid-20th century also inherited the French administrative structure of Departments and Communes, headed by a ''Chief-Lieu''.  States still using Chief-Lieu to identify the administrative headquarters of a government subdivision include [[Senegal]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Benin]], [[Mali]], and [[Niger]]l.&lt;ref&gt;Bierschenk T., Olivier de Sardan, J.‑P. (eds), 1998, "Les arènes locales face à la décentralisation et démocratisation. Analyses comparatives en milieu rural béninois", in Bierschenk T. &amp; Olivier de Sardan J.-P. (eds), Les pouvoirs au village. Le Bénin rural entre démocratisation et décentralisation, Paris, Karthala : 11‑51.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Taking [[Communes of Niger|Niger]] and [[Communes of Mali|Mali]] as examples, the administrative subdivisions down to the Commune level each have a formal place of administrative headquarters, titled the chef-lieu.  The larger portion of the terminology of administrative division is inherited from colonial rule as part of [[French West Africa]], and has survived and been somewhat modified over time. In both nations there have been remarkably parallel histories.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Fay [La décentralisation dans un Cercle (Tenenkou, Mali). Autrepart: Logiques identitaires, logiques territoriales, 2000, IRD http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/autrepart/010021949.pdf#page=122].&lt;/ref&gt;  With the decentralization process begun in both nations in the 1990s, the chef-lieu has transitioned from the location of the Governor, Commandant, or Prefect and their staff, to the location of Commune, [[Cercles of Mali]]/[[Departments of Niger]], and Regional Councils and a variety of decentralized bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Bréhima Béridogo, [« Processus de Décentralisation au Mali et Couches Sociales Marginalisées », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997 http://apad.revues.org/581]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for Mali, see Bréhima Kassibo, [« La Décentralisation au Mali : État des Lieux », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997  http://apad.revues.org/579]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''chefs-lieux'' of a Region, Cercle or Département, is usually also a Communal chef-lieu. Both nations collect these councils in a "High Council of Collectivites" seated at the nation's capital.  Smaller sub-divisions in Mali's Communes (Villages, Tribal councils, Quarters) are administered from or identified as a ''Place''/''Site'' (''Site'' in French), so the chef-lieu is literally the ''Chief-Place'' even at the lowest level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-17%20regime%20financier.pdf REPUBLIQUE DU NIGER Loi n° 2002-017 du 11 JUIN 2002 déterminant le régime financier des Régions, des Départements et des Communes]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-14%20cr%E9ation%20des%20communes.pdf Loi n° 2002-014 du 11 JUIN 2002 portant création des communes et fixant le nom de leurs chefs-lieux]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Includes list of 213 communes rurales and seats, 52 Communes urbaines and seats.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
In [[Russia]], the term is applied to the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|inhabited localities]], which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the [[republics of Russia|republics]], for which the term "[[capital city|capital]]" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term "administrative centre" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in [[Ukraine]].

==Switzerland==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is applied to the capital of each [[Swiss canton]].  In 16 of the 26 cantons, the territory is subdivided into districts. Every district also has a city nominated as chef-lieu and each has a prefect.

==Tunisia==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is used to designate the capital of each  '''gouvernorat''' (department).  Each of the 24 gouvernorats is subdivided into '''delegations'''  (districts) which each have a central city as '''chef-lieu of delegation'''.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] it is the centre of a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]], which is distinct from a [[Counties of the United Kingdom|historic county]] with a county town.

==Popular culture==
* ''The Fiancée of the pirate'' (1969) is a film by [[Nelly Kaplan]], where the action takes place in a hamlet where everyone spends their time worrying about what everyone thinks about the chef-lieu of the town.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">The '''Anti Common Market and Free Trade Party''' was a British political party that opposed Britain's membership of the European Union and fought a number of [[by-elections]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/apes/burning-icicles/british_politics.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also known as the '''Free Trade Liberal Party''' and '''All Party Anti-Common Market'''.  Among its members were [[Arthur Seldon]] and [[Oliver Smedley]].  It saw itself in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] tradition and its members were often involved with the free market [[Institute of Economic Affairs]].

By-elections contested included:

*[[Walthamstow West by-election, 1967]]
*[[Saffron Walden by-election, 1977]]
*[[Southend East by-election, 1980]]

'''Civilian control of the military''' is a doctrine in [[military science|military]] and [[political science]] that places ultimate [[command responsibility|responsibility]] for a [[Country|country's]] [[military strategy|strategic]] [[Group decision making|decision-making]] in the hands of the [[civilian]] [[politics|political]] [[leadership]], rather than professional [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. The reverse situation, where professional military officers control national politics, is called a [[military dictatorship]]. A lack of control over the military may result in a [[state within a state]]. One author, paraphrasing [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s writings in ''[[The Soldier and the State]]'', has summarized the civilian control ideal as "the proper subordination of a competent, professional military to the ends of policy as determined by civilian authority".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Edward R. ''[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA346358 Command in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Civil-Military Affairs]'' ([[pdf]]), [[United States Navy]] [[Postgraduate]] School thesis. 1998: 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian control is often seen as a prerequisite feature of a stable [[liberal democracy]]. Use of the term in scholarly analyses tends to take place in the context of a [[democracy]] governed by [[election|elected]] [[official]]s, though the subordination of the military to [[politics|political control]] is not unique to these societies. One example is the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. [[Mao Zedong]] stated that "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party," reflecting the primacy of the [[Communist Party of China]] (and [[Communist party|communist parties]] in general) as decision-makers in [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[Maoism|Maoist]] theories of [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref name=Mao-War&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], English language translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_12.htm Problems of War and Strategy]''. 1938. (''See also: [[q:Mao Zedong|Wikiquote: Mao Zedong]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] professor [[Richard H. Kohn]], "civilian control is not a fact but a process".&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;Kohn, Richard H. [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html An Essay on Civilian Control of the Military]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmations of respect for the values of civilian control notwithstanding, the actual level of control sought or achieved by the civilian leadership may vary greatly in practice, from a statement of broad policy goals that military [[commander]]s are expected to translate into [[military operation|operational]] plans, to the direct selection of specific targets for attack on the part of governing [[politician]]s. [[Head of government|National Leaders]] with limited experience in military matters often have little choice but to rely on the advice of professional military commanders trained in the [[operational art|art]] and [[military science|science]] of warfare to inform the limits of policy; in such cases, the military establishment may enter the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] arena to advocate for or against a particular course of action, shaping the policy-making process and blurring any clear-cut lines of civilian control.

Advocates of civilian control generally take a [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitzian]] view of [[war]], emphasizing its [[policy|political]] character.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The [[wikiquote:Georges Clemenceau|words]] of [[Georges Clemenceau]], "War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men" (also frequently rendered as "War is too important to be left to the [[general]]s"), wryly reflect this view. Given that broad [[military strategy|strategic]] decisions, such as the decision to declare a war, start an invasion, or end a conflict, have a major impact on the [[citizen]]s of the country, they are seen by civilian control advocates as best guided by the will of the people (as expressed by their [[representative government|political representatives]]), rather than left solely to an elite group of tactical experts. The [[military]] serves as a special [[government agency]], which is supposed to ''implement'', rather than ''formulate'', policies that require the use of certain types of physical force. Kohn succinctly summarizes this view when he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger purposes of a nation, rather than the other way around. The purpose of the military is to defend society, not to define it.&lt;ref name=Kohn /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[State (polity)|state's]] effective use of force is an issue of great concern for all national leaders, who must rely on the military to supply this aspect of their [[authority]]. The danger of granting military leaders full [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision-making process, and use physical force, or the threat of physical force, to achieve their preferred outcomes; in the worst cases, this may lead to a [[coup]] or [[military dictatorship]]. A related danger is the use of the military to crush domestic [[political opposition]] through intimidation or sheer physical force, interfering with the ability to have free and fair [[election]]s, a key part of the democratic process. This poses the paradox that "because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection".&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver.  1996. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control."  [http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']. 23(2): 149–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, military personnel, because of the nature of their job, are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare. The military is authoritative and hierarchical, rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html |title=Kohn: Civilian Control |publisher=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]] and almost everyone in high positions were military people like [[Hideki Tojo]], and advocated and basically pressured the leaders to start military conflicts against China and others because they believed that they would ultimately be victorious.

===Liberal theory and the American Founding Fathers===
Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] were suspicious of [[Standing army|standing militaries]].  As [[Samuel Adams]] wrote in 1768, "Even when there is a necessity of the military power, within a land, a wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it".&lt;ref name=Cairo&gt;Cairo, Michael F. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051026185242/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/democracy/dmpaper12.htm Democracy Papers: Civilian Control of the Military]'', [[U.S. Department of State]] International Information Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more forceful are the words of [[Elbridge Gerry]], a [[delegate]] to the American [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], who wrote that "[s]tanding armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican Governments, dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and generally converted into destructive engines for establishing despotism."&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 8]], one of ''[[The Federalist]]'' papers documenting the ideas of some of the Founding Fathers, [[Alexander Hamilton]] expressed concern that maintaining a large standing army would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking.  In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall.  Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army.  The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division.  He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.

[[James Madison]], another writer of many of ''The Federalist'' papers,&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Dietze. 1960. ''The Federalist: A Classic on Federalism and Free Government''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate.  Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty.  The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home.  Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended.  Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.
&lt;ref&gt;Max Farrand. 1911.  ''[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwfr.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787]''.  New Haven: Yale University Press. 1:465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] placed considerable limitations on the [[legislature]].  Coming from a tradition of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|legislative superiority in government]], many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war.  Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty.  James Madison, in [[Federalist No. 47]], continued Hamilton’s argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable.  In [[Federalist No. 48]], however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others.

Finally, in [[Federalist No. 51]], Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly.  Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders.  Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing.  Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.

Hamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously.  These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country’s existence.  While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels.  However, with the advent of the [[Cold War]] in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force "engendered new concerns" of militarism and about how such a large force would affect [[civil–military relations]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecommons.txstate.edu"&gt;Donald S. Inbody. 2009.  ''Grand Army of the Republic or Grand Army of the Republicans? Political Party and Ideological Preferences of American Enlisted Personnel''. ''[http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/51 Faculty Publications – Political Science]''. Paper 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic law enforcement===
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- do similar laws exist in other countries? --&gt;

The United States' [[Posse Comitatus Act]], passed in 1878, prohibits any part of the Army or the Air Force (since the U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army) from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities unless they do so pursuant to lawful authority.  Similar prohibitions apply to the Navy and Marine Corps by service regulation, since the actual Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to them.  The Coast Guard is exempt from Posse Comitatus since it normally operates under the [[Department of Homeland Security]] versus the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and enforces U.S. laws, even when operating as a service with the U.S. Navy.

The act is often misunderstood to prohibit any use of federal military forces in law enforcement, but this is not the case.  For example, the President has explicit authority under the Constitution and federal law to use federal forces or federalized militias to enforce the laws of the United States.  The act's primary purpose is to prevent local law enforcement officials from utilizing federal forces in this way by forming a "posse" consisting of federal Soldiers or Airmen.&lt;ref name=Hendell&gt;Hendell, Garri B. "[http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/2/336]" "Domestic Use of the Armed Forces to Maintain Law and Order—posse comitatus Pitfalls at the Inauguration of the 44th President" Publius (2011) 41(2): 336-348 first published online May 6, 2010 {{doi|10.1093/publius/pjq014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, practical political concerns in the United States that make the use of federal military forces less desirable for use in domestic law enforcement.  Under the U.S. Constitution, law and order is primarily a matter of state concern.  As a practical matter, when military forces are necessary to maintain domestic order and enforce the laws, state [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] forces under state control i.e., that state's [[Army National Guard]] and/or [[Air National Guard]] are usually the force of first resort, followed by federalized state militia forces i.e., the Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard "federalized" as part of the U.S. Army and/or U.S. Air Force, with active federal forces (to include "federal" reserve component forces other than the National Guard) being the least politically palatable option.

===Maoist approach===
[[Maoism|Maoist]] military-political theories of [[people's war]] and [[democratic centralism]] also support the subordination of military forces to the directives of the [[communist party]] (although the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] experience of many early leading [[Communist Party of China]] figures may make their status as [[civilian]]s somewhat ambiguous). In a 1929 essay ''On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party'', [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] explicitly refuted "comrades [who] regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and [who] refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks", prescribing increased scrutiny of the [[People's Liberation Army]] by the Party and greater political training of officers and enlistees as a means of reducing military autonomy &lt;ref name=Mao-Party&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], [[English language]] translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_5.htm On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party]''. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Mao's &lt;!-- in all Communist?--&gt;theory, the military—which serves both as a symbol of the [[revolution]] and an instrument of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—is not merely expected to defer to the direction of the ruling non-uniformed Party members (who today exercise control in the [[People's Republic of China]] through the [[Central Military Commission]]), but also to actively participate in the revolutionary political campaigns of the Maoist era.

== Methods of asserting civilian control ==
[[Image:MacArthur Manila.jpg|thumb|An immensely popular hero of [[World War II]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s public insistence on the need to expand the [[Korean War]], over the objections of President [[Harry S. Truman]], led to [[Dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur|the termination]] of his [[Command (military formation)|command]].]]

Civilian leaders cannot usually hope to challenge their militaries by means of force, and thus must guard against any potential usurpation of powers through a combination of policies, laws, and the inculcation of the values of civilian control in their armed services. The presence of a distinct civilian [[police]] force, [[militia]], or other [[paramilitary]] group may mitigate to an extent the disproportionate strength that a country's military possesses; civilian [[gun]] ownership has also been justified on the grounds that it prevents potential abuses of power by authorities (military or otherwise). Opponents of gun control have cited the need for a [[Gun politics#Balance of power|balance of power]] in order to enforce the civilian control of the military.

===A civilian commander-in-chief===
The establishment of a civilian [[head of state]], [[head of government]] or other government figure as the military's [[commander-in-chief]] within the [[chain of command]] is one legal construct for the propagation of civilian control.

In the United States, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gives the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[Declaration of war|declare war]] (in the [[War Powers Clause]]), while [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the Constitution establishes the [[President of the United States|President]] as the commander-in-chief.  Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

American presidents have used the power to dismiss high-ranking officers as a means to assert policy and strategic control.  Three examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s dismissal of [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] in the [[American Civil War]] when McClellan failed to pursue the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] following the [[Battle of Antietam]], [[Harry S. Truman]] [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieving]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of command in the [[Korean War]] after MacArthur repeatedly contradicted the Truman administration's stated policies on the war's conduct, and [[Barack Obama]]'s acceptance of [[Stanley A. McChrystal|Stanley McChrystal]]'s resignation in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] after a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article was published where he mocked several members of the Obama administration, including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]].

=== Composition of the military ===
Differing opinions exist as to the desirability of distinguishing the military as a body separate from the larger society. In ''The Soldier and the State'', [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] argued for what he termed "objective civilian control", "focus[ing] on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps".&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; This autonomous professionalism, it is argued, best inculcates an [[esprit de corps]] and sense of distinct military corporateness that prevents political interference by sworn servicemen and -women. Conversely, the tradition of the [[citizen-soldier]] holds that "civilianizing" the military is the best means of preserving the loyalty of the armed forces towards civilian authorities, by preventing the development of an independent "[[caste]]" of warriors that might see itself as existing fundamentally apart from the rest of society. In the early history of the United States, according to Michael Cairo,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[the] principle of civilian control... embodied the idea that every qualified citizen was responsible for the defense of the nation and the defense of liberty, and would go to war, if necessary. Combined with the idea that the military was to embody democratic principles and encourage citizen participation, the only military force suitable to the Founders was a citizen [[militia]], which minimized divisions between officers and the enlisted.&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a less [[egalitarian]] practice, societies may also blur the line between "civilian" and "military" leadership by making direct appointments of non-[[profession]]als (frequently social elites benefitting from [[patronage]] or [[nepotism]]) to an officer rank. A more invasive method, most famously practiced in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]], involves active monitoring of the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] through the appointment of [[political commissar]]s, posted parallel to the uniformed chain of command and tasked with ensuring that national policies are carried out by the armed forces. The regular [[job rotation|rotation]] of soldiers through a variety of different postings is another effective tool for reducing military autonomy, by limiting the potential for soldiers' attachment to any one particular [[military unit]]. Some governments place responsibility for approving [[promotion (rank)|promotions]] or officer candidacies with the civilian government, requiring some degree of deference on the part of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] seeking advancement through the ranks.

=== Technological developments ===
[[Image:Bombing in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|During the term of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the President and his advisors often chose specific [[bomb]]ing targets in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] on the basis of larger [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] calculations, without professional knowledge of the weapons or tactics. Apropos of LBJ's direction of the bombing campaign in Vietnam, no air warfare specialists attended the Tuesday lunches at which the targeting decisions were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/colloquia/cch4c.htm "Washington's Management of the Rolling  Thunder Campaign"], M. Jacobsen, ''US Naval Historical Center Colloquium on Contemporary History Project''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, direct control over military forces deployed for war was hampered by the technological limits of [[command, control, and communications]]; national leaders, whether democratically elected or not, had to rely on local commanders to execute the details of a [[military campaign]], or risk centrally-directed orders' obsolescence by the time they reached the [[front lines]]. The remoteness of government from the action allowed [[professional soldier]]s to claim military affairs as their own particular sphere of expertise and influence; upon entering a state of war, it was often expected that the [[general]]s and [[field marshal]]s would dictate strategy and tactics, and the civilian leadership would defer to their informed judgments.

Improvements in [[information technology]] and its application to wartime [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] (a process sometimes labeled the "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]") has allowed civilian leaders removed from the [[theater (military)|theater of conflict]] to assert greater control over the actions of distant military forces. [[Precision-guided munition]]s and real-time [[videoconferencing]] with field commanders now allow the civilian leadership to intervene even at the [[:wikt:tactical|tactical]] decision-making level, designating particular targets for destruction or preservation based on political calculations or the counsel of non-uniformed advisors.

=== Restrictions on Political Activities ===
In the United States the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] does not directly apply to the military, however, Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10) essentially applies the same rules to the military. This helps to ensure a non-partisan military and ensure smooth and peaceful transitions of power.

=== Political officers ===

{{main|political commissar}}

Political officers screened for appropriate ideology have been integrated into supervisory roles within militaries as a way to maintain the control by political rulers. Historically they are associated most strongly with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] rather than liberal democracies.

== Military dislike of political directives ==

While civilian control forms the normative standard in almost every society outside of [[military dictatorship]]s, its practice has often been the subject of pointed criticism from both uniformed and non-uniformed observers, who object to what they view as the undue "politicization" of military affairs, especially when elected officials or political appointees micromanage the military, rather than giving the military general goals and objectives (like "Defeat Country X"), and letting the military decide how best to carry those orders out. By placing responsibility for military decision-making in the hands of non-professional civilians, critics argue, the dictates of military strategy are subsumed to the political, with the effect of unduly restricting the fighting capabilities of the nation's armed forces for what should be immaterial or otherwise lower priority concerns.

===Case study: United States===
The "[[Revolt of the Admirals]]" that occurred in 1949 was an attempt by senior US Navy personnel, to force a change in budgets directly opposed to the directives given by the Civilian leadership.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] faced frequent allegations throughout his time in office (particularly after the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]) that he was ignoring military goals out of political and media pressure—a phenomenon termed the "[[CNN effect]]". Politicians who personally lack military training and experience but who seek to engage the nation in military action may risk resistance and being labeled "[[chickenhawk (politics)|chickenhawks]]" by those who disagree with their political goals.

In contesting these priorities, members of the professional military leadership and their non-uniformed supporters may participate in the bureaucratic bargaining process of the state's policy-making apparatus, engaging in what might be termed a form of [[regulatory capture]] as they attempt to restrict the policy options of elected officials when it comes to military matters. An example of one such set of conditions is the "[[Weinberger doctrine|Weinberger Doctrine]]", which sought to forestall another American intervention like that which occurred in the [[Vietnam War]] (which had proved disastrous for the morale and fighting integrity of the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]]) by proposing that the nation should only go to war in matters of "vital national interest", "as a last resort", and, as [[Powell Doctrine|updated]] by [[Caspar Weinberger|Weinberger]]'s disciple [[Colin Powell]], with "overwhelming force". The process of setting [[List of countries by military expenditures|military budgets]] forms another contentious intersection of military and non-military policy, and regularly draws active [[lobbying]] by rival military services for a share of the national budget.

Nuclear weapons in the U.S. are controlled by the civilian [[United States Department of Energy]], not by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

During the 1990s and 2000s, public controversy over [[LGBT policy in the U.S. military]] led to many military leaders and personnel being asked for their opinions on the matter and being given deference although the decision was ultimately not theirs to make.

During his tenure, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] raised the ire of the military by attempting to reform its structure away from traditional infantry and toward a lighter, faster, more technologically driven force. In April 2006, Rumsfeld was severely criticized by some retired military officers for his handling of the [[Iraq War]], while other retired military officers came out in support of Rumsfeld. Although no active military officers have spoken out against Rumsfeld, the actions of these officers is still highly unusual. Some news accounts have attributed the actions of these generals to the [[Vietnam war]] experience, in which officers did not speak out against the administration's handling of military action. Later in the year, immediately after the November elections in which the Democrats gained control of the Congress, Rumsfeld resigned.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

'''Cooperative federalism''', also known as '''marble-cake federalism''', is a concept of [[federalism]] in which national, [[State (administrative division)|state]], and [[local government]]s interact cooperatively and collectively to solve common problems, rather than making policies separately but more or less equally (such as the [[dual federalism]] of the 19th-century [[United States]]) or clashing over a policy in a system dominated by the national government.

==Comparison of European Union and United States==

&lt;!-- Lisbon Treaty, because its the first time, we have a tidy list like this. 19th century USA because its the only one I could find, please update it. --&gt;In the [[Lisbon Treaty]] the distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the European union is redistributed in 3 categories. In the United States soon after its creation (1789), it had exclusive competences only (changed somewhat since then, but the basic design remain to this day). Competences not explicitly listed belong to lower levels of governance.

==United States==

In the American federal system, there are limitations on national government's ability to carry out its policies through the executive branch of state governments.  For example, in ''[[Printz v. United States]]'', 521 U.S. 898 (1997) the Court held that the national government could not directly require state law enforcement officers to conduct background checks under the Brady firearms legislation.  The court explained that prior decisions warned that "this Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations."   And yet, there are significant advantages in a federal system to obtain state assistance in the local implementation of federal programs.  Implementing such programs through national employees would significantly increase the size and intrusiveness of the national government.  Moreover, local implementation may assure that these programs are implemented in ways that take local conditions into account.  

For this reason, Congress has often avoided adoption of completely nationalized programs by one of two devices.  In the first, Congress creates a delivery system for federal programs in which the national government encourages local implementation of a federal program by providing significant matching funds.    In this context, the phrase may be found in a number of Supreme Court and lower court federal cases.   The most frequent early use of the phrase may be found in a series of cases describing the paradigm for federally sponsored welfare programs such as medical assistance or the former [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) programs in which a participating state's program is financed largely by the Federal Government, on a matching fund basis, subject to federal mandatory regulations.   See for example, ''[[King v. Smith]]'' and a series of subsequent AFDC cases.  More recently, the phrase has been used in connection with other federal programs built on the cooperative federalism model. See ''California v. U.S.'' 438 U.S. 645 (1978) (Reclamation Act) and  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-698.ZO.html ''Schaffer v. Weist''] (Special education).  Here, the motivation for State compliance is that absent state compliance with federal conditions, the state loses significant federal funding.  

The second method of encouraging states to implement federal programs is described in ''[[New York v. United States]]'', 505 U.S. 144 (1992). In this form, the Congress states that it will take over the regulation of an activity at the national level, unless the State itself implements its own program of regulation meeting minimum federal standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hills|first=Roderick M.|title=The Political Economy of Cooperative Federalism: Why State Autonomy Makes Sense and "Dual Sovereignty" Doesn'tAuthor|journal=Michigan Law Review|year=1998|volume=96|issue=4|pages=813–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the motivation for State compliance is that absent state regulation, the state loses power over the regulated area entirely.  In ''New York v. United States'', the court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"....where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under the [[Commerce Clause]], we have recognized Congress' power to offer States the choice of regulating that activity according to federal standards or having state law preempted by federal regulation. ''[[Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Association]]''. See also ''FERC v. Mississippi''. This arrangement, which has been termed “a program of cooperative federalism,” Hodel, supra, is replicated in numerous federal statutory schemes. These include the [[Clean Water Act]], see Arkansas v. Oklahoma, (Clean Water Act “anticipates a partnership between the States and the Federal Government, animated by a shared objective”); the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]], see ''[[Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn.]]'', the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, see Department of Energy v. Ohio,  and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, see Kenaitze Indian Tribe v. Alaska."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the federal system places limits on the ability of the national government to require implementation by a State executive branch, or its local political subdivisions, that limitation does not apply in the same way to State judicial systems.  In part, this is because the founders understood that state courts would be courts of general jurisdiction, bound to apply both state and federal law.  In part, it is because the State courts adjudicate cases between citizens who are bound to comply with both state and federal law.  When the Congress seeks to establish federal legislation which governs the behavior of citizens, the Congress is free to choose among three judicial enforcement paradigms.  It may open both federal or state courts to enforcement of that right, by specifically providing concurrent jurisdiction in the federal courts.  It may grant [[exclusive jurisdiction]] to the federal courts, or it may choose to leave enforcement of that right to civil dispute resolution amongst parties in State court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3159">'''Cultural variation''' refers to the rich diversity in social practices that different cultures exhibit around the world. Music, language, dance, cuisine and art all change from one culture to the next, but so do gender roles, economic systems, and social hierarchy among any number of other humanly organised behaviours. Cultural variation can be studied across cultures (for example, a cross-cultural study of ritual in Indonesia and Brazil)&lt;ref&gt;{{Mason, P.H. (2016) Fight-dancing and the Festival: Tabuik in Pariaman, Indonesia, and Iemanjá in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil. Martial Arts Studies Journal, 2, 71-90. DOI: 10.18573/j.2016.10065}}&lt;/ref&gt; or across generations (for example, a comparison of [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Bristow, D., Amyx, D., Castleberry, S. B., &amp; Cochran, J. J. (2011). A cross-generational comparison of motivational factors in a sales career among Gen-X and Gen-Y college students. Journal of personal selling &amp; sales management, 31(1), 77-85.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often a subject studied by anthropologists, sociologists and cultural theorists with subspecialties in the fields of economic anthropology, ethnomusicology, health sociology etc. In recent years, cultural variation has become a rich source of study in [[neuroanthropology]], [[cultural neuroscience]], and [[social neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domínguez D|first1=JF|last2=Turner|first2=R|last3=Lewis|first3=ED|last4=Egan|first4=GF|title=Neuroanthropology: A Humanistic Science for the Study of the Culture–Brain Nexus|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=5|pages=138–47|doi=10.1093/scan/nsp024|pmc=2894669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domínguez D|first1=JF|title=Neuroanthropology and the Dialectical Imperative|journal=Anthropological Theory|date=2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=5–27|doi=10.1177/1463499612436459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=Concepts}}
"'''Dual Power'''" ({{lang-rus|Двоевластие|r=Dvoyevlastiye}}) was a term first used by [[Communism|communist]] [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870-1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=The Dual Power|date=April 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/may/20.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=Has Dual Power Disappeared?|date=May 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch11.htm|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|title=Dual Power|date=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described a situation in the wake of the [[February Revolution]], the first of two [[Russian Revolution]]s in that tumultuous year of [[1917]]. Two powers coexisted with each other and competed for legitimacy: the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] ([[workers councils]]), particularly the [[Petrograd Soviet]], and the continuing official state apparatus of the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] of democratic socialists.

Lenin argued that this essentially unstable situation constituted a unique opportunity for the Soviets and Bolsheviks to seize power by smashing the weak tottering Provisional Government and establishing themselves as the basis of a new form of state power.

This notion has informed the strategies of subsequent [[communist]]-led revolutions elsewhere in the world, including the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] of 1949 led by [[Mao Zedong]] (1893-1976) after the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1931 and 1946-1949) and in [[eastern Europe]] after [[World War II]] (1939-1945), such as in [[Czechoslovakia]] where after three years of post-war agitation and occupation by the invading Russian [[Red Army]] finally overthrew a moderate government with the Communists seizing power in 1948.

== Background ==
After [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] abdicated the throne, the resulting [[February Revolution]] led to the establishment of the Provisional Government and its counterpart, the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. The Provisional Government was composed of former State Duma representatives with approval from the Petrograd Soviet, whereas the Petrograd Soviet was made up of socialist leaders elected by a [[proletariat]] constituency.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 71&lt;/ref&gt; With the Russian government moving from an [[autocracy]] to this system of "dual power" with the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet constantly vying for power, there was much confusion on how both could coexist and govern effectively.

In this confusion, the Provisional Government realized the Soviet had the people's trust and enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 59&lt;/ref&gt; In the hopes of appeasing the Soviet and keeping the support of the population, the Provisional Government launched several very bold liberal acts and promoted civil liberties through means of freedom of speech, press, and assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 71-72&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, other than strategic political motives, the Provisional Government understood that their power was illegitimate, due to the fact that they were not elected by the people. To solve the problem of illegitimacy, the Provisional Government was in the process of establishing the Constituent Assembly, whose members would be democratically elected by the people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Constituent Assembly would never come to be under the Provisional Government's rule, as the elections were set after the Bolsheviks seized power in the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 348&lt;/ref&gt;

After the February Revolution, Lenin published his April Theses and in it he expressed unhappiness with the February Revolution as he described it as a "Bourgeois Revolution".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Russian Revolution, 1861-1917|last=Wood|first=Alan|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed for the slogan "All Power to the Soviets". Lenin mentioned that a Proletariat Revolution is necessary, and expressed that he has no interest in cooperating with the Provisional Government or the other Soviet leaders who are willing to compromise. Other Soviet leadership were skeptical to Lenin's ideas since they were afraid that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were advocating for anarchism. Lenin also criticized the Petrograd Soviet for governing alongside the Provisional Government, and accused them of forgetting and abandoning socialist ideas and the proletariat revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Provisional Government ==
The [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]'s members primarily consisted of former [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]] members under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s reign. Its members were mainly members of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]] (known as the Kadets party), as the Kadets were the only formal political party functioning in the Provisional Government at its conception. The ideological and political ideas differed wildly throughout the party's leadership and members, but most were moderates, offering both liberal and conservative views at times.  The Kadets and the Provisional Government alike pushed for new policies including the release of political prisoners, a decree of freedom of press, cessation of the [[Okhrana]], abolition of the death penalty, and rights for minorities. The Provisional Government and the Kadets also wanted Russia to continue to be involved in [[World War I]], much to the dismay of the Soviets. Despite certain political ideas, the Kadets became slightly more conservative overall with the rise of left-wing parties and left-wing thought within both the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government realized that their power was not legitimate since they were former Duma members, and not elected by a general public. They knew that to be seen as a legitimate government body, they would need to be elected by the people, and they established the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] and scheduled popular elections to take place later in the year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Alexander Kerensky]], a former member of the Fourth Duma and a chairmen of the Soviet Executive Committee and eventually the Prime Minister for the Provisional Government, was brought into the Provisional Government as a way to gain support from left-wing parties and the Petrograd Soviet. Kerensky was a moderate socialist, and believed that cooperation with the Provisional Government was necessary. Historian S.A. Smith explains that after the appointment of Kerensky "Thus was born 'dual power', an institutional arrangement under which the Provisional Government enjoyed formal authority, but where the Soviet Executive Committee had real power."&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 106&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government feared the Soviets immense growing power, and through this fear they tried to appease them as much as possible. When Kerensky became Prime Minister, he attempted to work with the Soviets including arming the Soviets and their followers during the [[Kornilov affair]]. The attempts of Kerensky would not last for a while, as the [[Bolsheviks]] did not believe in compromise and overthrew the Provisional Government in the October Revolution.

== Petrograd Soviet ==
The Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in Petrograd served as the voice of the smaller councils of deputies elected by commoners, specifically soldiers and workers. The Petrograd Soviet, therefore, could claim a much better understanding of the people's will, since it was composed of many orators whom the lower class population elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50418695|title=Voices of revolution : 1917|last=1953-|first=Steinberg, Mark D.,|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300101690|location=New Haven, CT|oclc=50418695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet was established after the February Revolution, composed of numerous socialist revolutionaries. However, its rapid rise to power meant the Petrograd Soviet did not have any legitimate claim to power, like its counterpart, the Provisional Government.

The workers and soldiers of Russia saw hope in the Petrograd soviets, and elected deputies to it en masse, causing it to gain membership at an alarming rate (1200 seats had been filled in a week). The Petrograd Soviet was seen as a benefactor that would bring them land, bread, and peace.

The Executive Committee was initially made up of Nikolai Ckheidze, Matvei Skobelev, and Alexander Kerensky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954018220|title=Russia in revolution : an empire in crisis, 1890 to 1928|last=1952-|first=Smith, S. A. (Stephen Anthony),|isbn=9780198734826|edition=First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=954018220}}&lt;/ref&gt; These men were socialists, but feared radicalism. To keep radical mentality from spreading and provoking a 'counter-revolutionary movement,' they chose to support the Provisional Government where necessary. This led to the uneasy balance of power called "Dual Power."

==July Days impact ==
The events of the [[July Days]] would solidify the issues of dual power within government between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet. Between the dates of July 3 and July 7 ([[Julian calendar|Julian Calendar]] date), a Bolshevik uprising, still disputed if intentional by Lenin, occurred. In what is seen as a "[[Grassroots|grass roots]]" uprising, workers and lower ranks of soldiers violently demonstrated in the streets, calling for the Soviet to take power over the Provisional Government.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),124&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising was supported by the Bolshevik Military Organization and Petersburg Committee, who sent in more support, but the leaders of the party had less concrete opinions about the demonstration.&lt;ref name="soviethistory.msu.edu"&gt;Lewis Siegelbaum, "July Days" [subject essay], ''Seventeen Moments in Soviet History: An On-Line Archive of Primary Sources'', accessed November 5, 2017, http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1917-2/july-days/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Kerensky|Alexander Kerenksy]], head of the Provisional Government, led a crackdown on those involved with the events of the July Days and overthrow of the Provisional Government. The military was used to gather and arrest violent demonstrators, retake government buildings from Bolshevik forces, and dissolve military units that had participated in the attempted overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 156&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government also attempted to undermine Lenin and his party by revealing their investigation of his ties to Germany, Russia's enemy during World War I.&lt;ref name="soviethistory.msu.edu"/&gt; These combined actions would quell the Bolshevik uprising and support until August 1917 (Julian).

The reinstatement of the death penalty for soldiers, and Kerensky transferring the Provisional Government into the Winter Palace were among the actions that led to accusations of counterrevolutionary activity (reestablishment of autocratic government) by the Provisional Government.&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;Ferro, Marc (1971). "The Russian Soldier in 1917: Undisciplined, Patriotic, and Revolutionary". ''Slavic Review''. 30 (3): 483-512&lt;/ref&gt; A new kind of duality between the classes (proletariat and bourgeoisie) was a split noticeable not only in government, but also in everyday life for Russians. This led to increased tensions between both theaters, and made it difficult for groups to collaborate.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Kaiser, ''The Workers' Revolution in Russia, 1917: The View From Below'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Petrograd Soviet represented the Proletariat, while the Provisional Government members were part of the former State Duma, representing the old government under the tsar. This divide was also evident in the military, between rank-and-file soldiers and military officers.&lt;ref name=":0x" /&gt; As World War I continued on, soldiers started to mutiny or to disobey orders from their superiors, while supporting the soviets, hoping to bring an end to Russia's involvement in the war.

== Bolshevik takeover ==
Although the Bolshevik party was largely put down after the events of the July Days, Lenin still believed that the group could gain power in government because of unsteadiness due to the dual power situation. In April he wrote that the time was not yet right for revolution, as the Petrograd Soviet was still involved and working with the Provisional Government, as well as stating, "we do not as yet know a type of government superior to and better than the Soviets."&lt;ref&gt;V.I Lenin,"The Dual Power", ''Marxist Internet Archive'', 2005, accessed October 30, 2017, https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm&lt;/ref&gt; With the July Days seen as "Lenin's worst blunder,"&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),122&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was not necessarily his intention, the Bolsheviks were still not in place to take over the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet.

However, with the [[Kornilov affair]] of August 1917 (Julian-style date), the Bolsheviks regained both power in their party, but also with the masses. With Kornilov's soldiers moving towards the capital of Petrograd (modern day [[Saint Petersburg]]) and the Provisional Government, Kerensky had released many Bolshevik leaders arrested during the July Days and also provided arms in order for the Bolsheviks to defend the Provisional Government. By arming and calling on those who he had earlier punished, the Bolsheviks saw that they truly were gaining power in the government and Russian society. The Russian population lost faith in the Provisional Government because of how it handled Kornilov's coup, and many began supporting the Bolsheviks, with the group winning elections throughout Petrograd, especially in districts made up of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 171&lt;/ref&gt; This event, coupled with food shortages, the continuation of Russian involvement in World War I, and mass unemployment, worked in the Bolsheviks favor, turning people away from the government in charge&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),147&lt;/ref&gt; and toward the party that promised "Bread, Peace, Land."&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 79&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government during the [[October Revolution]], they were able to do so with little resistance. The Provisional Government realized that their power was limited at the point of takeover, as the Bolsheviks had been gaining supporters and had more revolutionaries. When the actual overthrow occurred between the days of October 25 and 26 (Julian), Bolsheviks first seized means of transportation and communication, such as roads, bridges, railways, and post offices.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin then went to the Second Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies to present the overthrow of the Provisional Government and state authority by the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 173&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Winter Palace]] (at the time, the home of the Provisional Government) was seized without a causality the morning of the 26th, and the Congress had no choice but to approve Lenin's decree.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 175&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the period of dual power between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet came to a close.

== Strategy and ideological concepts ==
{{Main|Dual power (leftist theory)}}
As the [[ideology|ideological]] monopoly of dominant [[institutions]] is broken and people increasingly rely on Alternative Institutions (AIs), those who benefited from existing arrangements may seek to dismantle their upstart competitors. At the same time, those who seek fundamental changes in society or who find the alternative ways of organizing it valuable may seek to enlarge and strengthen the alternative infrastructure. Counter institutions (XIs) are created both to defend the AIs and to promote their growth. These work to challenge and attack the [[status quo]] while creating, defending, and securing space for opposition and alternative institutions. They do this with everything from [[political protest]]s, to direct appropriation (of plantations, government buildings, factories, etc.) for the use of alternative institutions, to civil disobedience or armed resistance. The line between AIs and XIs is seldom entirely clear as many alternative institutions are also self-promoting or defending. Together the AIs and XIs form an alternative source of power in society which is "necessarily autonomous from, and competitive with, the dominant system, seeking to encroach upon the latter's domain, and, eventually, to replace it."&lt;ref name="Dominick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://left-liberty.net/?p=265|title=An Introduction to Dual Power Strategy|last=Dominick|first=Brian A.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the process of building the alternative institutions and the ideology that supports them, the advantage of dual power is the creation of real, and not merely political, momentum towards the revolutionary transformation of society. Actual changes are ongoing, rather than postponed to a revolutionary moment, so needs unmet by the pre-existing order are being met during the struggle and no sector of society is told that its concerns can only be dealt with after victory is achieved. That is, creation of AIs and the political space for them has intrinsic benefits, apart from the advancement of the revolutionary project. Over the course of building AIs, the society at large is empowered, committed to change, and skilled in running society. Simultaneously, the credibility of a revolutionary vision is increased immensely by putting it into practice and by refining and improving it over time. It is also conceivable that factional splits between revolutionaries and reformers (and all the shades in between) could be reduced by having a common project that both find useful. Those forces that would be sent to suppress a revolutionary movement find themselves confronting people who have taken control over their own lives, rather than armed cadre attempting to impose a vision on the country, potentially obviating military conflict or at least reducing its severity. {{Citation needed | date = October 2017}}

Successful dual-power rebellions end with the acceptance of the new social forms by much of the populace and the realization by the old rulers that they are no longer capable of using their systems of force against the revolutionary movement. This can occur because noncooperation has crippled the old structures of power, because too few people remain loyal to the old rulers to enforce their will, or because the rulers themselves undergo an ideological conversion. At this point, there is not general confusion. The disappearance of old leaders and structures of power is accommodated by the expansion of the alternative system. The alleged "necessity" for a revolutionary vanguard to guide the revolutionary impulse is shown to have no basis: because the people have already learned how to govern their own affairs, they need no tutelage from above. The possibility of co-option is minimized: "When the people recognize their true power, it cannot be taken away by rhetoric or […] imposition."&lt;ref name='Dominick'/&gt;

Dual power is a strategy, rather than an ideology, and it could plausibly be used to advance a variety of forms of social change. However, the advantages of the strategy make it most compatible with perspectives that emphasize the exercise of power at the community level, that seek to make the revolutionary movement accountable to the people, that see the capability to revision and transform society as common rather than rare, and that seek decentralized forms of power. Call this version of the strategy grassroots dual power, the bottom-up transformation and replacement of the mechanisms of society.{{Citation needed | date = October 2017}}

[[Libertarian socialists]] have more recently appropriated the term to refer to the nonviolent strategy of achieving a libertarian socialist economy and polity by means of incrementally establishing and then networking institutions of direct [[participatory democracy]] to contest the existing power structures of state and capitalism. This does not necessarily mean disengagement with existing institutions; for example, Yates McKee describes a dual-power approach as "forging alliances and supporting demands on existing institutions — elected officials, public agencies, universities, workplaces, banks, corporations, museums — while at the same time developing self-organized counter-institutions."&lt;ref name='Yates'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagingnonviolence.org/feature/art-after-occupy/|first=Yates|last=McKee|title=Art after Occupy — climate justice, BDS and beyond|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the strategy itself is sometimes also referred to as "counterpower" to differentiate it from the term's Leninist origins.

'''East Riding County Council''' ('''ERCC''') was the [[county council]] of the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] from 1 April 1889 to 31 March 1974. 

The county council had jurisdiction over the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of the East Riding and therefore did not include the [[county borough]] of [[Kingston upon Hull]].

== Mission and objectives ==
The East Stratcom Team is intended to develop dedicated communication material on priority issues, where EU [[strategic communication]] needs to be improved or the EU is subject to [[disinformation]] campaigns. Such products will be put at the disposal of the EU's political leadership, press services, EU [[delegation]]s and EU Member States and are intended for the widest possible public audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/2116/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en|title=Questions and Answers about the East StratCom Task Force - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Team is designated to develop communication campaigns, targeting key [[audience]]s and focused on specific issues of relevance to those audiences, including local issues. The actions of the East Stratcom Team are built on existing work and coherent with wider EU communication efforts, including activities of the EU institutions and EU Member States.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

== Key Task Force products ==
The team's positive communications products are mainly focused on the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood and produced in the local languages of those countries. They are distributed via social media channels of the EU Delegations in the region, and are also carried on television and via other media and public events.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about the East StratCom Task Force|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/2116/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en|publisher=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en}} Material has been copied from this source. Reuse is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Task Force, in cooperation with the European Commission, led the EU's six month Eastern Partnership communications campaign culminating in the November 2017 Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/36233/eastern-partnership-summit-24112017_en|title=Eastern Partnership summit, 24/11/2017 - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's main product to raise awareness of disinformation is the weekly Disinformation Review (in English and Russian languages). This can provide valuable data for analysts, journalists and officials dealing with this issue. The Disinformation Review also brings the latest news and analyses of pro-Kremlin disinformation.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"/&gt; Launched in November 2015, the Disinformation Review has been described as "the best weekly disinformation bulletin anywhere in the West"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=Lecture by Edward Lucas|date=2016-07-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx_cqNR3bJA%7Clanguage=en%7Caccessdate=2018-03-19|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The full record of the Task Force's work on disinformation is available on its website [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ EUvsDisinfo.eu] (in [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/news/ English], [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ru/ Russian] and [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/de/ German] languages). The team also runs the European External Action Service's [https://eeas.europa.eu/ru/eu-information-russian_ru Russian language website]. It is also possible to follow the team on Twitter and Facebook. This communicates primarily about the EU's foreign policy by publishing information about EU activities, as well as EU statements and press releases with relevance to the Eastern Neighbourhood in particular.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"/&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
EU Member State Governments have strongly supported the Task Force since its inception and provide the majority of its staff.

The European Parliament has consistently supported the Task Force and called for adequate staffing and resourcing. An EP preparatory action for 2018 – "StratCom Plus" - has allocated €1.1m for the team to focus on how to counter disinformation on the EU more systematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/eu-anti-propaganda-unit-gets-1m-a-year-to-counter-russian-fake-news|title=EU anti-propaganda unit gets €1m a year to counter Russian fake news|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=2017-11-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the European Union’s East StratCom Task Force, a unit of the External Action Service (the EU’s foreign ministry and diplomatic branch). The Task Force was set up in March 2015 as a kind of early warning system to detect incoming Kremlin disinformation campaigns".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/how-russias-attack-on-freeland-got-traction-in-canada/|title=How Russia's attack on Freeland got traction in Canada - Macleans.ca|date=2017-03-14|work=Macleans.ca|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* East StratCom Task Force in EU Observer: "Eight member states have urged the EU's foreign service to significantly expand its work on countering Russian propaganda. They said in a letter to EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini that "in the face of unabated third party disinformation campaigns … we see an urgent need to further enhance the EU's StratCom capabilities (…) East StratCom circulates online notes that debunk Russian disinformation and has attracted 30,000 followers to its Twitter account. It also promotes positive coverage of the EU in former Soviet states".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/foreign/139573|title=Mogherini urged to do more on Russian propaganda|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More in [[EU Observer]]: "Its Disinformation Review, a weekly newsletter, and its daily tweets and infographics, should be in the laptops and phones of all MEPs and senior EU officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/opinion/136198|title=[Opinion] No joke: Russian propaganda poses EU threat|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lawfare Blog about the team: "The task force has made some meaningful contributions to the efforts to counter disinformation warfare. Over the course of its operation, East StratCom has identified over 3,500 disinformation cases (…) These statistics highlight the global nature of the problem, and the benefit of having a body working on disinformation beyond a single country’s borders. East StratCom’s supranational view also allows it to provide valuable insights into the broader strategy and goals of pro-Kremlin disinformation operations because it can see them as a cohesive whole, rather than isolated incidents in individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lawfareblog.com/european-union-steps-its-fight-against-fake-news|title=The European Union Steps Up its Fight Against Fake News|date=2017-11-14|work=Lawfare|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
An article published October 2016 on Kommunikations Forum analyses the sources East StratCom use for debunking alleged disinformation. It criticizes the top three sites, Ukrainian StopFake, EU and NATO, for not being objective credible sources in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kommunikationsforum.dk/artikler/Hvad-er-EU-s-anti-propaganda-task-forces-ideologiske-fundament|title=EU tilbageviser propaganda med objektiv sandhed|last=|first=|date=26 October 2016|work=Kommunikations Forum|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/29394520/Analysis_of_East_StratCom_sources_for_debunking_pro-Kremlin_misinformation|title=Analysis of East StratCom sources for debunking pro-Kremlin misinformation|last=Jesper|first=Larsen|date=24 October 2016|website=Academia|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion piece written by Danish commentator, Iben Thranholm, published on Russia Insider October 2015, were listed by East StratCom as pro-Kremlin disinformation. Member of the Danish Parliament, Marie Krarup, upon discovery raised the issue in January 2017, demanding Foreign Minister, Anders Samuelsen, to take action and stop ‘black listing’ of opinions, which he declined as the listing in his view was correctly labeled 'disinformation in support for Russia'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.altinget.dk/eu/artikel/udenrigsminister-dansk-debattoer-er-korrekt-opfoert-paa-propaganda-liste|title=Minister: Dansk debattør er korrekt opført på propaganda-liste|last=|first=|date=12 January 2017|website=Altinget|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response 28 commentators wrote a joint critique stressing their concern that ‘anybody with a critical view on mass immigration could end up in the black book of EU’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b.dk/kommentarer/28-kommentatorer-udenrigsministeren-stoetter-sortlistning-af-iben-thranholm|title=28 kommentatorer: Udenrigsministeren støtter sortlistning af Iben Thranholm|last=|first=|date=16 January 2017|website=Berlingske Tidende|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published October 2016 on Folkets Avis, lists several instances, where East StratCom has labelled critique of non Western immigration to EU as pro-Kremlin disinformation, regardless that neither the media or the content has any relation to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.folkets.dk/c/russisk-propaganda-EU-islamkritik|title=EU's East Stratcom: Islamkritik er russisk propaganda|last=|first=|date=6 October 2016|website=Folkets Avis|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by investigative journalists at Danish newspaper, Politiken, showed that East StratCom along with Western media falsely blamed separatists, not government forces, in Eastern Ukraine for initiating an offensive in the area of Avdiivka in January 2017. Sources used by East StratCom included [[Inform Napalm|InformNapalm]] which the article shows has ties to Ukrainian death list, [[Myrotvorets]] (Peacemaker) that lists people including journalists as 'traitors' for expressing certain opinions or visiting separatist controlled areas in Eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politiken.dk/udland/art5851073/EU-er-fanget-i-propaganda-krigens-t%C3%A5ger|title=EU er fanget i propaganda-krigens tåger|last=|first=|date=27 February 2017|work=Politiken|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon discovery of being listed for publishing pro-Kremlin disinformation, three Dutch major media organisations has sued the EU for libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kvdl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/Writ-of-summons-GS-TPO-Gelderlander-EU-Disinfo.pdf|title=Court subpoena in English|last=|first=|date=19 February 2018|website=Kenny Van der Laan lawfirm|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2018/02/dutch-media-outlets-take-eu-to-court-over-disinformation-claims/|title=Dutch media outlets take EU to court over disinformation claims|last=|first=|date=21 February 2018|work=Dutch News|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.poynter.org/news/three-publications-are-suing-eu-over-fake-news-allegations|title=Three publications are suing the EU over fake news allegations|last=|first=|date=28 February 2018|work=Poynter|access-date=1 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 2018, a majority of 109 votes to 41 of the Dutch Parliament voted to close EUvsDisinfo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/moties/detail?id=2018Z03708&amp;did=2018D18080|title=Gewijzigde motie van de leden Kwint en Yesilgöz-Zegerius over het opheffen van EU versus Disinfo (t.v.v. 21501-34-286) (Proposal to close East StratCom)|last=|first=|date=6 March 2018|website=Tweede Kamer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 2018, East StratCom announced they had deleted the listings of Dutch media in their database "following a detailed review".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euvsdisinfo.eu/removal-of-three-cases-further-to-complaints-by-dutch-media/|title=Removal of three cases further to complaints by Dutch media|last=|first=|date=8 March 2018|website=EU vs Disinformation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 March 2018, Dutch Minister of the Interior, who had previously&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rd.nl/vandaag/politiek/kabinet-trotseert-kamer-over-nepnieuwswaakhond-1.1471637|title=Kabinet trotseert Kamer over nepnieuwswaakhond (Cabinet defies Chamber about fake news watchdog)|last=|first=|date=6 March 2018|work=Reformatorisch Dagblad|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposed closing EUvsDisinfo, said that the government would make a case for closing it in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2221353-ook-ollongren-wil-nu-af-van-europese-waakhond-nepnieuws.html|title=Ook Ollongren wil nu af van Europese waakhond nepnieuws (Ollongren now also wants to get rid of European watchdog fake news)|last=|first=|date=10 March 2018|work=NOS|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://politiek.tpo.nl/2018/03/09/ollongren-nu-toch-anti-nepnieuwsbureau/|title=Minister Kajsa Ollongren nu toch tegen anti-nepnieuwsbureau (Minister Kajsa Ollongren now against anti-fake news agency)|last=|first=|date=9 March 2018|work=The Post Online (TPO)|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March 2018 the three Dutch media withdrew their case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2222185-media-trekken-kort-geding-tegen-eu-om-nepnieuws-in.html|title=Media trekken kort geding tegen EU om nepnieuws in|access-date=2018-03-19|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eva Cadena Sandoval''' is a Mexican politician that belonged to the [[National Regeneration Movement|MORENA]] party. She gained national infamy when hidden videos were released of her taking money that she alleged was for party funding. She subsequently became known on [[social media]] as '''La Recaudadora''' (The Collecter).

==Early life==
Cadena was born in [[Tlalmanalco]], [[Estado de México]] and moved to Las Choapas, Vercruz at age 7.&lt;ref name="Excel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atrapa escándalo a una “franciscana”; perfil de Eva Cadena Sandoval|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2017/05/03/1161200|website=Excélsior|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=es|date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cadena Sandoval began her career with a short-lived step by the ranks of the PRI in the early 2000s, but is expelled for not covering her quotas and begins to perform political work in the ranks of (PAN) National Action alongside Antonio Pouchoulen and Renato Tronco , from 2005 to 2013. 
With Morena, at 2016 she was a deputy in the state congress of Veracruz. She was a candidate for the mayorship of [[Las Choapas]], but her candidacy was revoked by the party following the scandal of the hidden videos.&lt;ref name="EU1"&gt;{{cite web|title=La "recaudadora" Eva Cadena volvió por más dinero|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/nacion/politica/2017/04/27/la-recaudadora-eva-cadena-volvio-por-mas-dinero|website=El Universal|accessdate=3 May 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==
A first video, published on April 24, 2017, shows Cadena taking $500,000 [[Mexican pesos]] from a woman whose face is not visible, with the money supposedly going to MORENA leader [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]].&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; In regards to this video, López Obrador said it was a "trick" released to slander and politically destroy the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Responde AMLO a la difusión de video sobre Eva Cadena|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2017/04/24/1159551|website=Excélsior|accessdate=3 May 2017|language=es|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadena claimed López Obrador did not know about the money and that she returned all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Digital|first1=Milenio|title=AMLO no supo del dinero, yo soy responsable: Eva Cadena|url=http://www.milenio.com/politica/eva_cadena-amlo-500_mil_pesos-videoescandalo-morena-veracruz-milenio_noticias_0_944905533.html|website=Milenio|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The videos were leaked to the national newspaper ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'' which subsequently published them.

'''Global feminism''' is a [[feminist theory]] closely aligned with [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial theory]] and [[postcolonial feminism]]. It concerns itself primarily with the forward movement of [[women's rights]] on a global scale.  Using different historical lenses from the legacy of colonialism, global feminists adopt global causes and start movements which seek to dismantle what they argue are the currently predominant structures of global [[patriarchy]]. Global feminism is also known as '''world feminism''' and '''international feminism'''.

Two historical examples Global Feminists might use to expose patriarchal structures at work in colonized groups or societies are medieval Spain (late eleventh to thirteenth centuries) and nineteenth-century Cuba. The former example concerns women of the ''Mudejar'' communities of Islamic Spain and the strict sexual codes through which their social activity was regulated. ''Mudejar'' women could be sold into slavery as a result of sexual activity with a Christian man; this was to escape the deemed punishment. Because of their simultaneous roles as upholding one's family honor and one of "conquered status and gender", "''Mudejar'' women suffered double jeopardy in their sexual contact with Christians [in Spain]".&lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard"&gt;Tamara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard, eds. ''Women and the Colonial Gaze''. {{ISBN|0-8147-3647-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century Cuba can be looked at as an example of colonialism and neocolonialism working together in a slave-based society to affect women's lives under patriarchy, where Cuba "remained a Spanish colony while enduring a neocolonial relationship with the United States".&lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt; Havana, a city noted for its "absence of the female form", had, "of all the major cities in the West...the most strict social restrictions on the female portion of its population".&lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt; Upper-class Cuban women were "a constant visual reminder of the separation between elite white society and the people of color they ruled".&lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt;

==Transnational mothering==
Forced commitment to double shifts, struggle for individual autonomy, and blurring the private and [[public sphere]] of labor are all additional concerns to the primary issue for migrant women, which is the right to [[motherhood]]. The phenomena of motherhood in a [[transnational feminism|transnational]] and contemporary time creates structural constraints for migrant women. Abusive employers and intimate violence is not the only problem these women have to face, but there are structural issues regarding the right to motherhood in this transnational era.&lt;ref&gt;Ladd-Taylor, Molly. "Mother-Worship/Mother-Blame: Politics and Welfare in an Uncertain Age." Ed. Andrea O'Reilly. Maternal Theory: Essential Readings (2007): 640–48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Women immigrants leave their chance overseas at an idealized motherhood of watching their children grow up while performing their [[gender role]], and deport to be the breadwinner. The restructuring of care from the effects of [[globalization]] and [[neoliberalism]] institutionalizes these women.

Globalization is constantly changing and as a result it is supporting the phenomena of women in the global south migrating to developed countries to serve domestic labors. The role of transnational mothering within a neoliberal spectrum affects the exploitation of women through the deprivation of their [[Civil and political rights|citizen rights]], by extracting the benefits of immigrant's labor while minimizing or eliminating any obligations, whether social or fiscal to the society or state.&lt;ref name="Choy, Catherine Ceniza 2003"&gt;Choy, Catherine Ceniza. (2003). "Empire of Care: Nursing and Migration in Filipino American History." Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant women of [[Third World]] countries are not drawn from their countries to the advancing economy of the First World, rather drawn from their economies that have been disrupted and distorted by Western colonial incursions, leaving many to be torn free of their roots and recruited to countries to fill its non permanent labor needs, preventing competition with native workers; fulfilling the complementary void.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Evelyn Nakano. "Women and Labor Migration." Ed. Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan. An Introduction to Women's Studies: Gender in a Transnational World (2006): 444–48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Transnational mothering is viewed as an accommodation for both classes.

Motherhood, along with [[reproductive freedom]] and marriage, is the fundamental right of women but is prohibited by nations that justify foreign domestic services, as much as view immigrant women as a threat to its nationalism.&lt;ref name="Choy, Catherine Ceniza 2003"/&gt; Nations create a process of [[racial formation]] through which women of different national and racial identities experience discrepant integration within a society, ultimately contributing to hierarchies of citizenship. In relation to [[social Darwinism]], natives believe that Third World migrants "just can't make it", and fear degeneration, thus nations try to weed out those who do not fit the upper or [[middle class]] society in ways such as sterilization; e.g.; black women are identified as devious, immoral, domineering, sexually promiscuous, and bad mothers, resulting in their reproductive rights being threatened by regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Dorothy, and Andrea O'Reilly. "Killing the Black Body." Maternal Theory: Essential Readings (2007): 482–500. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aachen Allegory.jpg|thumb|[[Hans von Aachen]], ''Allegory'' or ''The Triumph of Justice'' (1598)]]
'''Global justice''' is an issue in [[political philosophy]] arising from the concern about unfairness. It is sometimes understood as aform of internationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/doi/10.1111/raju.12153/full|title=Responsibility and  Global Justice|last=Risse|first=Mathias|date=2017|website=Wiley Online Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Henrik Syse]] argues that global ethics and international justice in western tradition is part of the tradition of [[natural law]]. It has been organized and taught within Western culture since Latin times of Middle Stoa and Cicero and the early Christian philosophers Ambrose and Augustine. Per Syse "This early natural-law theorizing teaching centered around the idea of a ius naturale, i.e., a system of right which is natural and as such common to all people, available to humankind as a measuring stick of right and wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Natural Law to Human Rights — Some Reflections on Thomas Pogge and Global Justice|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-3142-4_13|publisher = Springer Netherlands|date = 2005-01-01|isbn = 978-1-4020-3141-0|pages = 229–237|series = Studies in Global Justice|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-3142-4_13|first = Henrik|last = Syse|editor-first = Andreas|editor-last = Follesdal|editor-first2 = Thomas|editor-last2 = Pogge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Per the American political scientist [[Iris Marion Young]] "A widely accepted philosophical view continues to hold that the scope of obligations of justice is defined by membership in a common political community. On this account, people have obligations of justice only to other people with whom they live together under a common constitution, or whom they recognize as belonging to the same nation as themselves." English philosopher [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] agreed, that obligations only apply to people living together or that are part of the same Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = RESPONSIBILITY AND GLOBAL JUSTICE: A SOCIAL CONNECTION MODEL|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0265052506060043|journal = Social Philosophy and Policy|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 1471-6437|pages = 102–130|volume = 23|issue = 01|doi = 10.1017/S0265052506060043|first = Iris Marion|last = Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What we owe one another in the global context is one of the questions the global justice concept seeks to answer.&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2015|title = Global Justice|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/justice-global/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Gillian|last = Brock|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are positive and negative duties which may be in conflict with ones moral rules.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Cosmopolitanism|Cosmopolitans]], reportedly including the ancient Greek [[Diogenes of Sinope]], have described themselves as ''citizens of the world''.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, 'Life of Diogenes' in ''The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'' trans. C.D. Yonge. [http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dldiogenes.htm], accessed 8 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ín 1976, [[William Godwin]] a [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] thinker and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] argued that everyone has an impartial duty to do the most good he or she can, without preference for any one human being over another.&lt;ref&gt;William Godwin, ''Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' ed. Isaac Kramnick. London: Penguin, 1976 [1793].&lt;/ref&gt;

The broader political context of the debate is the longstanding conflict between more and less local institutions: tribes against states, villages against cities, local communities against empires, nation-states against the [[United Nations|UN]]. The relative strength of the local versus the global has waxed and waned over recorded history. From the [[early modern period]] until the twentieth century, the preeminent political institution was the [[Sovereign state|state]], which is [[Sovereignty|sovereign]], territorial, claims a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence in its territory, and exists in an international system of other sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Van Creveld, ''The Rise and Decline of the State''. Cambridge: CUP, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the same period, and relatedly, political philosophers' interest in [[justice]] focused almost exclusively on [[Domestic policy|domestic]] issues: how should states treat their subjects, and what do fellow-[[citizen]]s owe one another? Justice in relations between states, and between individuals across state borders was put aside as a secondary issue or left to [[international relations]] theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Caney, ''Justice Beyond Borders''. Oxford: OUP, 2006. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[World War I|First World War]], however, the state system has been transformed by [[globalization]] and by the creation of [[International organization|supranational]] political and economic institutions such as the [[League of Nations]], the United Nations, and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;David Held, 'The Transformation of Political Community' in Ian Shapiro ed., ''Democracy's Edges''. Cambridge: CUP, 1999: 84-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the same period, and especially since the 1970s, global justice became an important issue in political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Onora O'Neill, 'Transnational Economic Justice' in ''Bounds of Justice''. Cambridge: CUP, 2000: 115-42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the contemporary global justice debate, the general issue of impartiality centers on the moral significance of borders and of shared citizenship. [[Realism in international relations|Realist]]s, [[Epistemological particularism|particularist]]s, [[nationalist]]s, members of the [[society of states tradition]], and cosmopolitans take contesting positions in response to these problems.

==Central questions==
Three related questions, concerning the scope of justice, justice in the [[distribution of wealth]] and other goods, and the institutions responsible for justice, are central to the problem of global justice. When these questions are addressed in non ideal circumstances, they are part of the "ethics of process," a branch of [[political ethics]].

===Scope===
Are there, as the moral universalist argues, objective ethical standards that apply to all humans regardless of [[culture]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[religion]], [[nationality]] or other distinguishing features?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Moral Relativism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Spring 2012 Edition)|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/moral-relativism/|website = plato.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or do ethical standards only apply within such limited contexts as [[culture]]s, [[nations]], communities, or voluntary associations?

A Moral Conception of Social Justice is only Universalistic if: 
* It subjects all persons to the same system of fundamental moral principles
* These principles assign the same fundamental moral benefits and burdens to all: and
* These fundamental benefits and burdens do not privilege or disadvantage certain groups arbitrarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Poverty and Human Rights - Thomas Pogge|url = http://thomaspogge.com/books/world-poverty-human-rights/|website = Thomas Pogge|accessdate = 2015-09-14|isbn = 9780745641447|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150919070037/http://thomaspogge.com/books/world-poverty-human-rights/|archivedate = 2015-09-19|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Further|Moral universalism|Moral relativism}}

===Distributive equality===
[[Gillian Brock]] asks "Do we have an obligation to ensure people have their basic needs met and can otherwise lead “decent” lives, or should we be more concerned with global socio-economic equality?".&lt;ref name=platojustice&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Justice - What Global Duties Do We Have?|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-global/#WhaGloDutDoWeHav|website=Stanford|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1.1 billion people &amp;mdash; 18% of humanity &amp;mdash; live below the [[World Bank]]'s $2/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Xavier |last=Sala-i-Martin |title=The Disturbing "Rise" of Global Income Inequality |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 8904 |date=April 2002 |doi=10.3386/w8904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is this distribution of wealth and other goods just? What is the root cause of poverty, and are there systemic injustices in the [[world economy]]? [[John Rawls]] has said that  international obligations are between states as long as "states meet a minimal condition of decency" where as [[Thomas Nagel]] argues that obligations to the others are on an individual level and that moral reasons for restraint do not need to be satisfied for an individual to deserve equal treatment internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Problem of Global Justice|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1088-4963.2005.00027.x/abstract|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|date = 2005-03-01|issn = 1088-4963|pages = 113–147|volume = 33|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1088-4963.2005.00027.x|first = Thomas|last = Nagel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter Singer argues in [[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]] that the rich have a moral obligation to give their money away to those who need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Famine, Affluence, and Morality, by Peter Singer|url = http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm|website = www.utilitarian.net|accessdate = 2015-09-14|first = Pablo|last = Stafforini}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Institutions===
What ''institutions''—[[Sovereign state|states]], communes, [[Federalism|federal]] entities, global financial institutions like the [[World bank|World Bank]], international [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], [[multinational corporations]], [[International judicial institutions|international courts]], a [[World government|world state]]—would best achieve the ideal of global justice?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountability and global governance: challenging the state-centric conception of human rights {{!}} Lafont {{!}} Ethics &amp; Global Politics|url = http://www.ethicsandglobalpolitics.net/index.php/egp/article/view/5507|website = www.ethicsandglobalpolitics.net|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; How might they gain our support, and whose responsibility is it to create and sustain such institutions? How free should movement between the jurisdictions of different territorial entities be?

Thomas Pogge says that States can not achieve global justice by themselves "It has never been plausible that the interests of states—that is, the interests of governments—should furnish the only considerations that are morally relevant in international relations."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Real World Justice - Thomas Pogge|url = http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|website = Thomas Pogge|accessdate = 2015-09-14|isbn = 978-1-4020-3142-7|publisher = |last = Follesdal|first = A|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150912020643/http://thomaspogge.com/books/real-world-justice/|archive-date = 2015-09-12|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like the World Trade Organization have advocated free trade but allow protectionism in affluent developed countries to this point according to Pogge and Moellendorf.&lt;ref name="Brock"/&gt;

Public polls have shown that there is support for the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perspectives on International Justice and Human Rights|url = https://www.pbs.org/pov/reckoning/perspectives_amicc.php|accessdate = 2015-09-14|website = PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 130 Civil Society groups in Africa have recognized that the ICC operates unevenly but in the interest of reaching global justice remain supportive of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Africa: AU and the International Criminal Court|url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201310140485.html|newspaper = AfricaFocus (Washington, DC)|access-date = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambodia the [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal|Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]], some observers had said "the court will not truly be effective unless it can properly address the crucial issue of how reparations will be given to victims of the regime" while others supported it, "I think the case is going to be the most important trial in Cambodian history." said Youk Chhang the director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CAMBODIA: Justice Goes Beyond Indictment of Khmer Rouge Leaders {{!}} Inter Press Service|url = http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/09/cambodia-justice-goes-beyond-indictment-of-khmer-rouge-leaders/|website = www.ipsnews.net|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Former Khmer Rouge minister dies in Cambodia - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/22/asia/cambodia-khmer-rouge-ieng-thirith-dead/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; One worldwide institution, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], responsible for creating agreements on climate change has been criticized for not acting fast enough. by Truthout.

===Minimum criteria===

==== Nayef Al-Rodhan ====

Philosopher [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] argues in his 2009 book, ''Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph'', that [[well-being|human well-being]] is dependent on the preservation and promotion of [[human dignity]] and that human dignity is directly linked to global justice. In order to achieve global justice, eight minimum criteria must be met. These are 1) [[dialogue]], 2) effective and representative [[Multilateralism|multilateral institutions]], 3) representative [[Decision-making processes|decision-making]] structures, 4) fair treatment, 5) [[empathy]], 6) [[accountability]], 7) [[Government transparency|transparency]], and 8) adherence to [[international law]].
Because interconnectedness between peoples and geo-cultural domains is becoming increasingly common, Al-Rodhan maintains that the fate of one geo-cultural domain will affect the fate of others. [[Justice]] is central to human dignity, individual geo-cultural triumph, and the overall well-being of human [[civilization]]. Thus, according to Al-Rodhan, meeting the minimum criteria of global justice is a prerequisite to the triumph of human civilization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Global justice is the paramount to global security, because [[injustice]] can lead to feelings of [[anger]], [[humiliation]], and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional [[Psychological egoism|self-interest]] and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people feel that they have been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, [[justice]] and not just [[Armed forces|military power]], is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often feel that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current [[status quo]] are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Al-Rodhan therefore recommends that [[Social justice|fairness]] in terms of the participants in [[dialogue]] is a prerequisite for the promotion of universal justice. Similarly, he argues that diplomacy must be based on [[openness]] to hearing and acknowledging the concerns and positions of others. Empathy and an acknowledgement of the grievances and past pains of others are crucial, as is giving all stakeholders a voice in the [[decision-making process]]. Finally, Al-Rodhan argues that all states, no matter how powerful, must be bound by international law and its obligations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Al-Rodhan, Nayef R.F., Sustainable History and the Dignity of Man: A Philosophy of History and Civilisational Triumph, LIT, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Pogge]] has contended that an "institutional order can not be just if it fails to meet the minimal human rights standard". That standard is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2017}} Mathias Risse has argued that an injustice is not present, "While indeed 1.2 billion people in 1998 lived below the poverty line of $1.08 PPP 1993 per day, it is also true that there is now less misery than ever before," Less Misery is his standard for justice. He wrote in 2005, that "progress made over the last 200 years is miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Do We Owe the Global Poor Assistance or Rectification?|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0892679400003580|journal = Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date = 2005-03-01|issn = 1747-7093|pages = 9–18|volume = 19|issue = 01|doi = 10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00485.x|first = Mathias|last = Risse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main positions==
Five main positions&amp;mdash;realism, particularism, nationalism, the society of states tradition, and cosmopolitanism (in two forms) &amp;mdash; have been taken by contributors to the global justice debate.

===Realism===
{{Main|Realism in international relations}}
Realists, such as [[Charles Yeo]], [[Hashim Tilab]] argue that there are no global ethical standards, and that to imagine that there are is a dangerous fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Realism and neoliberalism: International relations theory and Southeast Asian security|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09512749508719123|journal = The Pacific Review|date = 1995-01-01|issn = 0951-2748|pages = 5–24|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/09512749508719123|first = Sheldon W.|last = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; States are the main actors in an [[Anarchy in international relations|international anarchy]], and they either will or should always attempt to act rationally in their own interests. So, in response to the three central questions above: moral universalism is either false, or merely says that nothing is forbidden to any state in pursuit of its interests. There is no obligation to help the poor, unless doing so helps to further a state's strategic aims. And the state system is taken as the fundamental and unchallengeable global institutional arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;''REALPOLITIK AND WORLD PEACE'', by Gordon L. Anderson, International Journal on World Peace, Vol. 26, No. 4 (DECEMBER 2009), pp. 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particularism===
Particularists, such as [[Michael Walzer]] and [[James Tully (legal theorist)|James Tully]], argue that ethical standards arise out of shared meanings and practices, which are created and sustained by discrete cultures or societies. Moral and social criticism is possible within the boundaries of such groups, but not across them. If a society is [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], for instance, its citizens can be morally wrong, and can meaningfully criticise each other, if they do not live up to their own egalitarian ideals; but they cannot meaningfully criticise another, [[caste]]-based society in the name of those ideals. "A given society is just if its substantive life is lived in a certain way&amp;mdash;that is, in a way faithful to the shared understandings of [its] members."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer, ''Spheres of Justice''. New York: Basic Books, 1983. p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unjust if not. Each society has its own, different standards, and only those inside it are bound by those standards and can properly criticise themselves. So, moral universalism is false, because objective ethical standards vary between cultures or societies. We should not apply the same criteria of distributive justice to strangers as we would to compatriots. [[Nation state|Nation-states]] that express their peoples' shared and distinctive ethical understandings are the proper institutions to enable local and different justices.

For [[Charles Blattberg]], however, there exists a particularist approach to global justice, one based upon what he calls a "global patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2034932|title=Social Science Research Network (SSRN) |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Communitarianism|Cultural relativism|Multiculturalism}}

=== Nationalism ===
{{Main|Nationalism}}
Nationalists, such as [[David Miller (political theorist)|David Miller]] and [[Yael Tamir]], argue that demanding mutual obligations are created by a particular kind of valuable association, the [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;David Miller, ''On Nationality''.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; We may have [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] duties to aid the particularly badly off worldwide, but these are much less stringent and pressing than our duties to our fellow-[[citizen]]s.  Nationalism has traditionally included this assumption of differing moral obligations to those within and those outside the nation, reflected for example in the fact that the benefits of the [[welfare state]] are not available to citizens of other countries. So, moral universalism is too simple, because the ethical standards that apply between compatriots differ from those that apply between strangers (although some nationalists argue for the universal ethical standard that nations should have their own states).  Distributive justice is an issue within nations but not necessarily between them. And a world-system of nation-states is the appropriate organiser of justice for all, in their distinct associational groups.

=== Society of states ===
In the society of states tradition, states are seen as individual entities that can mutually agree on common interests and rules of interaction, including moral rules, in much the same way as human individuals can. Often, this idea of agreement between peers is formalised by a [[social contract]] argument.

One prominent exemplar of the tradition is [[John Rawls]]. In ''[[The Law of Peoples]]'', Rawls extends the method of his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' to the question of global justice. His argument is that we can justify a global regime by showing that it would be chosen by representatives of Peoples in an imagined [[original position]], which prevents them knowing which particular People they represent.  This decision-in-ignorance models fairness because it excludes selfish bias.  When Rawls applied this method in the case of domestic justice, with parties in the original position representing individual members of a single society, he argued that it supported a [[Income redistribution|redistributive]], egalitarian liberal politics. In contrast, Rawls argues that when his method is applied to global justice, it supports a quite traditional, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian international ethics: duties of states to obey treaties and strict [[Just war|limits on warmaking]], but no global repossession of private property.  So, different justices apply to the domestic and international cases.  Even if justice requires egalitarianism within states, it does not do so between them.  And a system of cooperating but independent states is the just global institutional arrangement.  Rawls describes this ideal as a 'realistic utopia'.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''The Law of Peoples''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1999. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[John Rawls|Rawls]], other notable exponents of this position include [[Hedley Bull]].

=== Cosmopolitanism ===
{{See also|Cosmopolitanism}}
[[Image:John Gower world Vox Clamantis detail.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Gower]], ''[[Vox Clamantis]]'' detail (c. 1400): the world]]
Cosmopolitans argue that some form of moral universalism is true, and therefore that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, fall within the scope of justice.  Their arguments typically appeal to consistency, as follows:
# The moral standing of individuals is based on some morally significant characteristics.
# These characteristics are shared by ''all'' humans (and not only by the members of some nation, culture, society, or state).
# Therefore, ''all'' humans have moral standing (and the boundaries between nations, cultures, societies and states are morally irrelevant).&lt;ref&gt;Caney, ''Justice Beyond Borders'', Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Cosmopolitans differ, however, over ''which'' shared human characteristics are morally significant.

[[Consequentialism|Consequentialist]] cosmopolitans, amongst whom [[Peter Singer]] is prominent, argue that the proper standard of moral judgement for actions, practices or institutions is their consequences, and that the measure of consequences is the [[Quality of life|welfare]] of humans (or even of all [[Sentience|sentient]] creatures).  The capacity to experience welfare and suffering is therefore the shared basis for moral standing. This means that the fact that some people are suffering terrible deprivations of welfare, caused by poverty, creates a moral demand that anyone who is able to help them do so.  Neither the physical distance between the rich and the poor, nor the fact that they are typically citizens of different countries, has any moral relevance.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer ‘Famine, Affluence, and Morality’, ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 1(1972): 229-243. Online version listed under External links.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human rights defender]]s of cosmopolitanism, such as [[Thomas Pogge]] and [[Simon Caney]], argue that all humans have rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = CANEY|first1 = SIMON|title = Cosmopolitan Justice, Responsibility, and Global Climate Change|journal = Leiden Journal of International Law|date = 9 January 2006|volume = 18|issue = 04|pages = 747|doi = 10.1017/S0922156505002992|url = http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/FACULTY/RARNESON/phil267fa12/CANEYcosmop.pdf|accessdate = 6 March 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150510005322/http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/phil267fa12/CANEYcosmop.pdf|archive-date = 10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=World Poverty and Human Rights|journal=Ethics &amp; International Affairs|date=28 September 2012|volume=19|issue=01|pages=1–7|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7093.2005.tb00484.x|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps those set out in the [[UN Declaration of Universal Human Rights|UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].  It may be argued that these rights create a [[positive duty]] of the rich to provide what they guarantee (security, a livelihood, etc.); or, alternatively, it may be argued that the rich are currently violating their [[negative duty]] not to impose a global order that systematically violates rights of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Pogge, ''World Poverty and Human Rights''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others defend neoconservative [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] from a view of cosmopolitanism for the added benefits to human rights that such intervention could bring. Some defended the 2003 invasion of Iraq from this motive due to the human rights abuses Saddam had inflicted on countless members of the Kurdish and Shiite communities.

Individual cosmopolitans also differ considerably in how they understand the requirements of distributive justice and the legitimacy of global institutions. Some, for instance [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]], endorse world government; others, such as [[Simon Caney]], do not. The extent to which cosmopolitans advocate global redistribution of resources also varies. All cosmopolitans, however, believe that individuals, and not states, nations, or other groups, are the ultimate focus of universal moral standards.

==Demands==
None of the five main positions described above imply complete satisfaction with the current world order. Realists complain that states that pursue [[utopian]] moral visions through intervention and [[humanitarian aid]], instead of minding their own strategic interests, do their subjects harm and destabilise the international system.&lt;ref&gt;for instance E.H. Carr, ''The Twenty Years Crisis 1919-1939''. London: Macmillan, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularists object to the destruction of traditional cultures by cultural [[colonialism]], whether under the guise of economic [[liberalism]] or defence of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;for instance James Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity''. Cambridge: CUP, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nationalists deplore the fact that so many people are [[Stateless person|stateless]] or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes.&lt;ref&gt;for instance Miller, ''On Nationality''.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the society of states are concerned about [[rogue state]]s and about the [[Imperialism|imperial]] ambitions of the powerful.&lt;ref&gt;for instance Rawls, ''The Law of Peoples''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states.&lt;ref&gt;for instance Caney, ''Justice Beyond Borders''.&lt;/ref&gt; It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us to do much more than most now do.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7975">'''Governance frameworks''' are the structure of a government and reflect the interrelated relationships, factors, and other influences upon the institution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Governance structure'' is often used interchangeably with ''governance framework'' as they both refer to the structure of the [[governance]] of the organization.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Oliver E.|date=1984-01-01|title=The Economics of Governance: Framework and Implications|jstor=40750687|journal=Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft / Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics|volume=140|issue=1|pages=195–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governance frameworks structure and delineate power and the governing or [[management]] roles in an organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scu.edu.au/governance/index.php/4|title=Governance Framework - Governance - SCU|website=scu.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also set rules, procedures, and other informational guidelines.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charity-commission-governance-framework/governance-framework|title=Governance framework - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, governance frameworks define, guide, and provide for enforcement of these processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These frameworks are shaped by the goals, strategic mandates, financial incentives, and established power structures and processes of the organization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.claytonutz.com/knowledge/2012/april/writing-good-governance-frameworks-a-how-to-guide|title=Writing good governance frameworks: A how-to guide - Knowledge - Clayton Utz|website=www.claytonutz.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governance frameworks establish and perpetuate the efficiency or lack of efficiency in an organization or institution's ability to meet its goals, and even their public relations and perception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The organization of the governance framework is important for the success of the organization meeting its goals.  [[Sociology|Sociologist]] John Child states that these are connected and, in a circular manner, belief that changes in governance frameworks will succeed positively impacts the chance that the framework will result in the desired changes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Additionally, Williamson suggests that the organization of a governance framework results in economic consequences for that organization.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Frequently, the term ''good governance framework'' references a preferred style of governance that the author believes to be better suited to that industry or organization, especially in relation to public relations, and organizational and financial transparency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications ==
There are examples of the use of governance frameworks in a wide variety of industries, as well as in the government of nation states and the public sector.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In their application to specific industries, companies, and problems, governance frameworks appear differently and reflect the unique needs of the group or organization.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Child|first=John|date=1972-01-01|title=Organizational Structure, Environment and Performance: The Role of Strategic Choice|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/003803857200600101|journal=Sociology|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1177/003803857200600101|issn=0038-0385}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the governance structure of [[Information technology|internet technology]] (IT) organizations, multiple frameworks have been suggested by authors connecting IT issues to the underlying theoretical business, [[Sociology of organisations|organizational sociology]], and economic models.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlberg|first=T.|last2=Kivijarvi|first2=H.|date=January 2006|title=An Integrated Framework for IT Governance and the Development and Validation of an Assessment Instrument|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1579685&amp;tag=1|journal=Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06)|volume=8|pages=194b–194b|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2006.57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PhD|first=A.

{{Basic Forms of government}}

A '''government in exile''' is a political group which claims to be a [[Sovereign state|country]] or [[Federated state|semi-sovereign state]]'s legitimate [[government]], but is unable to exercise legal power and instead resides in another state or foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=government-in-exile |title=Princeton University WordNet |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments in [[exile]] usually plan to one day return to their native country and regain formal power. A government in exile differs from a [[rump state]] in the sense that a rump state controls at least part of its former territory.&lt;ref&gt;Tir, J., 2005-02-22 "Keeping the Peace After Secessions: Territorial Conflicts Between Rump and Secessionist States" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Honolulu, Hawaii Online &lt;.PDF&gt;. 2009-05-25 from [https://archive.is/20120721042748/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p72056_index.html allacademic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during [[World War I]], nearly all of [[Belgium]] was [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied]] by [[German Empire|Germany]], but Belgium and its allies held on to a small slice in the country's west.  A government in exile, in contrast, has lost all its territory.

Exiled governments tend to occur during [[war]]time occupation, or in the aftermath of a [[civil war]], [[revolution]], or [[Coup d'état|military coup]]. For example, during German expansion in [[World War II]], some [[Europe]]an governments sought refuge in the [[United Kingdom]], rather than face destruction at the hands of [[Nazi Germany]]. A government in exile may also form from widespread belief in the illegitimacy of a ruling government. Due to the outbreak of the [[Syrian Civil War]] back in 2011, for instance, the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]] was formed by groups whose members sought to end the rule of the ruling [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Ba'ath Party]]. 

The effectiveness of a government in exile depends primarily on the amount of support it can receive, either from foreign governments or from the population of its own country. Some exiled governments come to develop into a formidable force, posing a serious challenge to the incumbent [[regime]] of the country, while others are maintained chiefly as a symbolic gesture.

The phenomenon of a government in exile predates the formal utilization of the term. In periods of [[Monarch|monarchical government]], exiled monarchs or dynasties sometimes set up exile courts—as the [[House of Stuart]] did when driven from their throne by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and again at the [[Glorious Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corp|first1=Edward|title=A Court in Exile: The Stuarts in France, 1689-1718|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521108373|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see {{section link|James Francis Edward Stuart|Court in exile}}). The [[House of Bourbon]] would be another example because it continued to be recognized by other countries at the time as the legitimate government of France after it was overthrown by the populace during the [[French Revolution]]. This continued to last through the rule of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1803-04 to 1815. With the spread of [[constitutional monarchy]], monarchical governments which were exiled started to include a [[prime minister]], such as the [[Dutch government-in-exile|Dutch government during World War II]] headed by [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy]].

==Activities==
[[International law]] recognizes that governments in exile may undertake many types of actions in the conduct of their daily affairs. These actions include:
* becoming a party to a bilateral or international [[treaty]]
* amending or revising its own [[constitution]]
* maintaining [[military forces]]
* retaining, or newly obtaining, [[diplomatic recognition]] from other states
* issuing [[Identity document|identity cards]]
* allowing the formation of new [[Political party|political parties]]
* holding [[election]]s

In cases where a host country holds a large [[expatriate]] population from a government in exile's home country, or an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] population from that country, the government in exile might come to exercise some administrative functions within such a population. For example, the WWII [[Provisional Government of Free India]] had such authority among the [[Malaysian Indian|ethnically Indian]] population of [[British Malaya]], with the consent of the then [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] military authorities.

==Current governments in exile==
Governments in exile may have [[List of states with limited recognition|little or no recognition from other states]]. Some exiled governments have some characteristics in common with [[rump state]]s. Such disputed or partially in exile cases are noted in the tables below.

===Deposed governments of current states===
These governments in exile were created by [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] governments or rulers who continue to claim legitimate authority of the state they once controlled.

However, there are also some who do not accept that the sovereignty of Taiwan was legitimately returned to the Republic of China at the end of the war nor that the Republic of China is a government-in-exile. The current [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]]-ruled Republic of China government is inclined to this view.

===Deposed governments of current subnational territories===
These governments in exile claim legitimacy of autonomous territories of another state and have been created by deposed governments or rulers, who do not claim [[independence]] as a separate state.

===Exiled governments of non-self-governing or occupied territories===
These governments in exile are governments of [[Self-governance|non-self-governing]] or occupied territories. They claim legitimate authority over a territory they once controlled, or claim legitimacy of a [[Decolonization|post-decolonization]] authority. The claim may stem from an exiled group's election as a legitimate government.

The [[United Nations]] recognizes the [[right of self-determination]] for the population of these territories, including the possibility of establishing independent sovereign states.

From the [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] in 1988 in exile in [[Algiers]] by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], it has effectively functioned as the government in exile of the Palestinian State. In 1994, however the PLO established the [[Palestinian National Authority]] interim [[Palestinian territories|territorial]] administration as result of the [[Oslo Accords]] signed by the PLO, Israel, the United States, and [[Russia]]. Between 1994 and 2013, the PNA functioned as an autonomy, thus while the government was seated in the West Bank it was not sovereign. In 2013, Palestine was upgraded to a non-member state status in the UN.

All of the above created an ambiguous situation, in which there are two distinct entities: The Palestinian Authority, exercising a severely limited amount of control on the ground under the tutelage of an Israeli military occupation; and the State of Palestine, recognized by the United Nations and by numerous countries as a fully sovereign and independent state, but not able to exercise such sovereignty on the ground. Both are headed by the same person—as of February 2016, President [[Mahmud Abbas]]—but are judicially distinct. For example, a dissolution of The Palestinian Authority and resumption of full rule on the ground by Israel would not in itself affect the State of Palestine, which could continue to exist as a government-in-exile diplomatically recognized by the UN and by numerous countries.

===Exiled governments with ambiguous status===
These governments have ties to the area(s) they represent, but their claimed status and/or stated aims are sufficiently ambiguous that they could fit into other categories.{{original research inline|date=June 2018}}

Though his son and heir [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|Prince Ernest Augustus]] retained a formal claim to be the legitimate King of Hanover until 1918 (when all German Royal Families were dethroned) he does not seem to have kept up a government-in-exile.

===Sovereign Military Order of Malta===
The [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] may be considered a case of a government in exile, since it is without territory but recognised as a sovereign government by numerous sovereign countries. However, it does not claim to be a sovereign state, rather a "sovereign subject" of international law. In addition, it no longer claims [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|jurisdiction over Malta]], and recognises and maintains diplomatic relations with the independent [[Republic of Malta]].

===World War II===
Many countries established a government in exile after loss of [[sovereignty]] in connection with [[World War II]].

====Governments in London====
A large number of European governments-in-exile were set up in London.
{{Governments in exile}}

Other exiled leaders in Britain in this time included [[King Zog of Albania]] and [[Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia]].

====The Danish exception====
The [[Occupation of Denmark]] (9 April 1940) was administered mainly by the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Office]], contrary to other occupied lands that were under [[Military Administration (Nazi Germany)|military]] or [[Reichskommissariat|civilian administration]]. [[Denmark]] did not establish a government in exile, although there was an Association of Free Danes established in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Who's who of the Allied Governments and Allied Trade &amp; Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBbUAAAAMAAJ|year=1944|publisher=Allied Publications|page=173}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Durham Divine|title=Navies in Exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJg-AAAAIAAJ|year=1944|publisher=E.P.

(See [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland during World War II]], and [[History of Greenland during World War II]].)

====Governments-in-exile in Asia====
The [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] (invaded 9 December 1941) established a government in exile in Australia and the United States.

While formed long before World War II, the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] continued in exile in China until the end of the war.

At the fall of Java, and the surrender by the Dutch on behalf of Allied forces on 8 March 1942, many Dutch-Indies officials (including [[Hubertus van Mook|Dr van Mook]]  and [[Charles van der Plas|Dr Charles van der Plas]]) managed to flee to Australia in March 1942, and on 23 December 1943, the Royal Government (Dutch) decreed an official '''Netherlands East Indies Government-in-exile''', with Dr van Mook as Acting Governor General, on Australian soil until Dutch rule was restored in the Indies.&lt;ref name=ba&gt;Lockwood, R.

====Axis-aligned "governments-in-exile"====
Under the auspices of the Axis powers, Axis-aligned groups from some countries set up "governments-in-exile" in Axis territory, even though internationally recognized governments remained in place in their home countries.

===Persian Gulf War===
Following the [[Ba'athist Iraq]]i [[Invasion of Kuwait|invasion]] and [[Kuwait Governorate|occupation]] of [[Kuwait]], during the [[Persian Gulf War]], on August 2, 1990, [[Sheikh]] [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] and senior members of his government fled to [[Saudi Arabia]], where they set up a [[Kuwaiti Government in exile|government-in-exile]] in [[Ta'if]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-08-24/news/9008240543_1_saad-kuwait-government-in-exile&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuwaiti government in exile was far more affluent than most other such governments, having full disposal of the very considerable Kuwaiti assets in western banks—of which it made use to conduct a massive [[propaganda]] campaign denouncing the Ba'athist Iraqi occupation and mobilizing public opinion in the western hemisphere in favor of war with [[Ba'athist Iraq]]. In March 1991, following the defeat of Ba'athist Iraq at the hands of coalition forces in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the Sheikh and his government were able to return to Kuwait.

===Municipal Councils in Exile===

Following the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 and the displacement of many [[Greek Cypriot]]s from [[North Cyprus]], displaced inhabitants of several towns set up what are in effect Municipal Councils in Exile, headed by Mayors in Exile. The idea is the same as with a national Government in Exile – to assert a continuation of legitimate rule, even though having no control of the ground, and working towards restoration of such control. Meetings of the exiled [[Lapithos#Former municipality|Municipal Council of Lapithos]] took place in the homes of its members until the Exile Municipality was offered temporary offices at 37 Ammochostou Street, Nicosia. The current Exile Mayor of the town is Athos Eleftheriou. The same premises are shared with the Exile Municipal Council of [[Kythrea]].

Also in the [[Famagusta District]] of Cyprus, the administration of the part retained by the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] considers itself as a "District administration in exile", since the district's capital [[Famagusta]] had been under Turkish control since 1974.

'''Inclusive Democracy''' ('''ID''') is a project that aims for [[direct democracy]]; [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy; [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm); and [[ecological democracy]].

The theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy—as distinguished from the political project on which the ID movement is based—emerged from the work of [[Greece|Greek-born]] [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]], [[Socialist economics#Economic models and systems|economist]], [[activist]] and former [[academic]] [[Takis Fotopoulos]], in the book ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'', and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altpress.org/mod/apc_directory/index.php?function=display&amp;id=169 "International Journal of Inclusive Democracy"] The Alternative Press Center&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the theoretical project of ID is a project emerging in Political Philosophy about social change (see e.g. [[Marxism]], [[Social ecology (theory)|Social Ecology project]], the [[Autonomy|autonomy project]], the Inclusive Democracy project, etc.). On the other hand, the political project of ID (as any political project for social emancipation) is a project emerging in the History of social struggle (e.g. along [[Socialism|socialist movement]], [[Autonomism|autonomist movement]], [[Direct democracy|classical (direct) democracy movement]], etc.).

According to [[Arran Gare]],  ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' "offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both [[neo-liberalism]] and existing forms of [[State socialism|socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 "Beyond Social Democracy? Takis Fotopoulos' Vision of an Inclusive Democracy as a New Liberatory Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706115814/http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin%3A989/SOURCE1 |date=2011-07-06 }} ''Democracy &amp; Nature'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003), pp. 345–58&lt;/ref&gt; David Freeman argues that Fotopoulos' approach in that book "is not openly [[anarchism]], yet anarchism seems the formal category within which he works, given his commitment to direct democracy, municipalism and abolition of state, money and market economy".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, David, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol1/vol1_no3_freeman.htm "Inclusive democracy and its prospects"] review of book ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy: The Crisis of the Growth Economy and the Need For a New Liberatory Project'', published in ''Thesis Eleven'' no. 69 (Sage Publications, May 2002), pp. 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conception of Inclusive Democracy ==
Fotopoulos describes Inclusive Democracy as "a new conception of democracy, which, using as a starting point the classical definition of it, expresses democracy in terms of direct political democracy, economic democracy (beyond the confines of the market economy and state planning), as well as democracy in the social realm and [[ecological]] democracy. In short, inclusive democracy is a form of social organisation which re-integrates society with economy, polity and nature. The concept of inclusive democracy is derived from a synthesis of two major historical traditions, the [[Athenian democracy|classical democratic]] and the [[socialist]], although it also encompasses radical green, [[feminist]], and [[liberation movement]]s in the South".&lt;ref&gt;"Inclusive Democracy" entry in ''Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy'', ed. by R.J. Barry Jones, 2001, pp. 732–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point of the ID project is that the world, at the beginning of the new millennium, faces a [[multi-dimensional crisis]] (economic, ecological, social, cultural and political), which is shown to be caused by the concentration of power in the hands of various [[elites]]. This is interpreted to be the outcome of the establishment, in the last few centuries, of the system of [[market economy]] (in the [[Karl Polanyi|Polanyian]] sense),&lt;ref&gt;Karl Polanyi, ''The Great Transformation, the Political and Economic Origins of Our Time,'' (Beacon Press, 1944/1957), pp. 43–44, 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Representative democracy]], and the related forms of [[hierarchical structure]]. Therefore, an inclusive democracy is seen not simply as a [[utopia]], but perhaps as the only way out of the crisis, based on the equal distribution of power at all levels.

In this conception of democracy, the public realm includes not just the political realm, as is usual the practice in the [[Classical republicanism|republican]] or [[Direct democracy|democratic project]] ([[Hannah Arendt]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Murray Bookchin]] et al.),&lt;ref&gt;Ingerid S. Straume, [https://www.academia.edu/994824/A_Common_World_Arendt_Castoriadis_and_Political_Creation "A Common World? Arendt, Castoriadis and Political Creation,"] ''European Journal of Social Theory,'' Vol. 15, No. 3 (August 2012), pp. 367–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, ''Urbanization without Cities'' (Monteal: Black Rose, 1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; but also the economic, 'social' and ecological realms. The political realm is the sphere of political decision-making, the area in which political power is exercised. The economic realm is the sphere of economic decision-making, the area in which economic power is exercised with respect to the broad economic choices that any [[scarcity]] society has to make. The social realm is the sphere of decision-making in the workplace, the education place and any other economic or cultural institution which is a constituent element of a democratic society. The public realm could be extended to include the "ecological realm", which may be defined as the sphere of the relations between society and nature. Therefore, the public realm, in contrast to the private realm, includes any area of human activity in which decisions can be made collectively and democratically.

According to these four realms, we may distinguish between four main constituent elements of an inclusive democracy: the political, the economic, 'democracy in the social realm' and the ecological. The first three elements form the institutional framework, which aims at the equal distribution of political, economic and social power respectively. In this sense, these elements define a system, which aims at the effective elimination of the domination of human being over human being. Similarly, ecological democracy is defined as the institutional framework, which aims to eliminate any human attempt to dominate the natural world, in other words, the system, which aims to reintegrate humans and nature.

== Institutional framework ==

===Political or direct democracy===
The necessary condition for the establishment of a political democracy involves the creation of appropriate institutions, which secure an equal distribution of political power among all citizens. All political decisions (including those relating to the formation and execution of laws) are taken by the citizen body collectively and without representation.The citizen body of a particular geographical area consists of all residents beyond a certain age of maturity and irrespective of their gender, race, ethnic or cultural identity. The age of maturity is to be defined by the citizen body itself.

The sufficient condition for the reproduction of a political democracy refers to the citizens' level of democratic consciousness and, as David Gabbard &amp; Karen Appleton point out, "the responsibility of cultivating the democratic consciousness requisite to this conception of citizenship falls to [[paideia]]"&lt;ref&gt;David Gabbard &amp; Karen Appleton, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol2/vol2_no1_gabbard_appleton.htm "The Democratic Paideia Project: Beginnings of an Emancipatory Paideia for Today"], ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy,'' Vol. 2, No. 1 (September 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; which involves not simply education but character development and a well-rounded knowledge and skills, i.e. the education of the individual as citizen, which alone can give substantive content to the public space. This is particularly so because democracy can only be grounded on the conscious choice of citizens for individual and collective autonomy. Thus it cannot be the outcome of any social, economic or natural "laws" or tendencies dialectically leading to it, let alone any divine or mystical dogmas and preconceptions. In this sense, neither representative democracy nor soviet democracy meet the conditions for political democracy, and are simply forms of political oligarchy, where political power is concentrated in the hands of various elites, i.e. professional politicians, and party bureaucrats respectively.

The basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. This is very close to the concept of the 'urban village' proposed today by supporters of de-growth economics.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Homs, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol3/vol3_no1_Homs_urban_villages.htm "Localism and the city: the example of "urban villages"], ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy,'' Vol. 3, No. 1 (January 2007). Retrieved 21 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from local decisions, many important decisions are to be made at the regional or confederal level. This is why, as [[Serge Latouche]] observes, the aim of Inclusive Democracy "presupposes a confederation of demoi" made up of small, homogenous units of around 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Latouche, [http://mondediplo.com/2006/01/13degrowth?var_recherche=Serge+Latouche "How do we learn to want less? The globe downshifted"], ''Le Monde diplomatique'' (January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.

The citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker . Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle,  by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.

Finally, political or direct democracy implies a very different conception of citizenship than the usual liberal and socialist conceptions. In this conception, political activity is not a means to an end, but an end in itself so that one does not engage in political action simply to promote one's welfare but to realize the principles intrinsic to political life, such as freedom, equality and solidarity. This, in contrast to the liberal and social-democratic conceptions which adopt an 'instrumentalist' view of citizenship, i.e. a view which implies that citizenship entitles citizens with certain rights that they can exercise as means to the end of individual welfare.

===Economic democracy and the role of an artificial market===
The ID project introduced a very different conception from the usual one of [[economic democracy]]. According to the ID project, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere—which requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all 'macro' economic decisions, namely, decisions concerning the running of the economy as a whole (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used, etc.) are made by the citizen body collectively and without representation. However, "micro" economic decisions at the workplace or the household levels are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of [[voucher]]s.

As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy today is only feasible at the level of the confederated demoi. It involves the ownership and control of the means of production by the [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]. This is radically different from the two main forms of concentration of economic power : capitalist and 'socialist' [[Economic growth|growth]] economy. It is also different from the various types of collectivist capitalism, such as [[workers' control]] and milder versions suggested by post-Keynesian social democrats. The demos, therefore, becomes the authentic unit of economic life.

For economic democracy to be feasible, three preconditions must be satisfied: Demotic [[self-sufficiency|self-reliance]], demotic ownership of the means of production, and confederal allocation of resources.

*Demotic self-reliance is meant in terms of radical [[decentralisation]] and collective [[self-sufficiency]], in the sense of relying on the demos' resources rather than in the sense of  [[autarky]].
*Demotic ownership of productive resources is a kind of ownership which leads to the politicisation of the economy, the real synthesis of economy and polity. This is so because economic decision making is carried out by the entire community, through the demotic assemblies, where people make the fundamental macro-economic decisions which affect the whole community, as citizens, rather than as vocationally oriented groups (e.g. workers, as e.g. in [[Parecon]]).&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol9/takis_parecon.htm "Inclusive Democracy and Participatory Economics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808143931/http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol9/takis_parecon.htm |date=2011-08-08 }}, ''Democracy &amp; Nature'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, workers, apart from participating in the demotic decisions about the overall planning targets, would also participate (in the above broad sense of vocationally oriented groups) in their respective workplace assemblies, in a process of modifying/implementing the Democratic Plan and in running their own workplace.
*Confederal allocation of resources is required because, although self-reliance allows many decisions to be made at the community level, much remains to be decided at the regional/national/supra-national level. However, it is delegates (rather than representatives) with specific mandates from the demotic assemblies who are involved in a confederal demotic planning process which, in combination with the proposed system of vouchers, effects the allocation of resources in a confederal inclusive democracy.

A model of economic democracy, as an integral part of an inclusive democracy, is described in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' (ch 6), the first book-length description of inclusive democracy. The main characteristic of the proposed model, which also differentiates it from socialist planning models like Parecon, is that it explicitly presupposes a stateless, money-less and market-less economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalisation of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice. The proposed system aims at satisfying the double aim of:

*(a) meeting the basic needs of all citizens—which requires that basic macro-economic decisions have to be made democratically, and
*(b) securing freedom of choice—which requires the individual to make important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume etc.).

Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: 
*(1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and the confederal assembly, and
*(2) an [[artificial market]] using personal vouchers, which ensures [[freedom of choice]] but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although some have called this system "a form of money based on the [[labour theory of value]]",&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper, ''Modern Environmentalism'' (Routledge, 1996), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.

Another distinguishing feature of ID is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is according to need for basic needs, and according to effort for non-basic needs. ID is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast,Fotopoulos argues, Parecon follows the  [[socialdemocratic]] rather than the [[anarcho-communist]] tradition and instead of proposing satisfaction according to need (as the ID project does) declares, first, that particular consumption needs such as health care or public parks will be free to all and, second, that as regards special needs, people will be able to make particular requests for need based consumption to be addressed case by case by others in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807014331/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism]'', [[Verso Books]], 2003, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Michael Albert]] explicitly states that what he calls 'norm four', i.e. 'remuneration according to each person's need' should be applied only in exceptional cases of basic needs and not to all needs defined as such by the citizens'  assemblies, as the Inclusive Democracy project declares. Thus, as Albert stresses: "beyond economic justice, we have our compassion, to be applied via norm four where appropriate such as in cases of illness, catastrophe, incapacity and so on".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807014331/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism]'', Verso Books, 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Artificial market ====
Proposed within Inclusive Democracy as a solution to the problem of maintaining freedom of choice for the consumer within a marketless and moneyless economy, an artificial market operates in much the same way as traditional markets, but uses [[labour voucher]]s or personal credit in place of traditional money. Because of the use of a labour voucher system in consumption of goods and services, an economy using an artificial market would have no actual flow of money and thus the only kind of market that could exist would be a market for commercial goods and services, eliminating capital markets and labour markets.

According to Takis Fotopoulos, an artificial market "secures real freedom of choice, without incurring the adverse effects associated with real markets".&lt;ref name="inclusivedemocracy.org"&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project''], (London &amp; NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an artificial market was first proposed by the [[anarchist]] theorists [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] with their respective systems of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] and [[collectivist anarchism]]. who suggested replacing traditional currency with a system of "labour-cheques" while still retaining basic market relations for goods and services.

The artificial market however is rarely advocated as the only element for the allocation of goods and services by its proponents, as most also support a form of directly democratic planning for non-commercial goods and vital resources, and in some cases regulation of the artificial market through planning also. In the ID's system of allocation of resources, "the artificial market complements the envisaged direct democratic planning mechanism in the allocation of all goods and services on the basis of the crucial distinction introduced in this model between basic and nonbasic goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol6/vol6_no2_takis_beyond_market_economy_and_statist_planning.htm “Beyond the Market Economy and Statist Planning: Towards Democratic Planning as part of a Confederal Inclusive Democracy,”] The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol. 6, No. 2/3 (Spring/Summer 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fotopoulos, "the allocation of economic resources is made first, on the basis of the citizens' collective decisions, as expressed through the community and confederal plans, and second, on the basis of the citizens' individual choices, as expressed through a voucher system".&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project], (London &amp; NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed system of the artificial market aims at: 
*(A) meeting the basic needs of all citizens, and
*(B) securing freedom of choice in a marketless, moneyless and stateless 'scarcity–society' which has not yet achieved universal autarky (self-sufficiency).&lt;ref name="inclusivedemocracy.org"/&gt;

The former requires that basic macro–economic decisions have to be taken democratically, whereas the latter requires the individual to take important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume, etc.). Both the macro–economic decisions and the individual citizens' decisions are envisaged as being implemented through a combination of democratic planning and an artificial market. But, while in the 'macro' decisions the emphasis will be on planning, the opposite will be true as regards the individual decisions, where the emphasis will be on the artificial market.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.democracynature.org/vol3/fotopoulos_outline.htm Outline of an Economic Model for an Inclusive Democracy], [[Democracy &amp; Nature]], Vol.3, No.3, (1997), pp. 27–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most artificial market proponents reject the traditional [[socialist]] adoption of the [[labour theory of value]] as they believe it cannot be used as the basis for allocating scarce resources. The reason given is that even if the labour theory of value can give a (partial) indication of availability of resources, it certainly cannot be used as a means to express consumers' preferences. Thus they feel that the labour theory of value cannot serve as the basis for an allocative system that aims at both meeting needs and, at the same time, securing consumer sovereignty and freedom of choice. Instead, the model proposed here is, in fact, a system of rationing, which is based on the revealed consumers' preferences on the one hand, and resource availability on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project''], (London &amp; NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of [[Participism]] and Parecon in particular reject markets in all forms in favour of democratic participatory planning. While Parecon also uses [[Labour voucher|personal credit]] in place of money, prices are set according to the direct requests of consumers in democratic "consumer councils" whose demands are relayed to economic [[Facilitation board (economics)|facilitation boards]] who determine and set final prices based on a combination of [[marginal utility]] and [[opportunity cost]]. On the other hand, as Fotopoulos argues, "no kind of economic organisation based on planning alone, however democratic and decentralized it is, can secure real self-management and freedom of choice."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Ed.,[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/pdf%20files/pdf%20vol5/Special%20Issue%20Winter%202009.pdf "Recent Theoretical Developments on the Inclusive Democracy Project" in "Global Capitalism and the Demise of the Left:Renewing Radicalism Through Inclusive Democracy,"] ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', Vol. 5, No. 1, special issue (winter 2009), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy in the social realm===
An inclusive democracy is inconceivable unless it extends to the broader social realm to embrace the workplace, the household, the educational institution and indeed any economic or cultural institution, which constitutes an element of this realm. The equal distribution of power in these institutions and [[Self-managed economy|self-management]] are secured through the creation of assemblies of the people involved in each place of work or education (workers' assemblies, student and teachers' assemblies respectively) who make all important decisions about the functioning of these places, within the framework of the decisions taken by citizens' demotic assemblies as regards the general aims of production, education and culture respectively. The assemblies are federated at the regional and confederal levels so that the confederal assemblies of workers, teachers, students and so on could be involved in a process of constant interaction with the citizens' confederal assemblies to define society's "general interest".

A crucial issue with respect to democracy in the social realm is democratisation of the [[household]]. One possible solution is the removal of the divide between the household and the public realm. Thus, some feminist writers, particularly eco-feminists, glorify the ''[[oikos]]'' and its values as a substitute for the ''[[polis]]'' and its politics. This can be understood as an attempt to dissolve the public into the private. At the other extreme, some [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] attempt to remove the public/private divide by dissolving all private space into a singular public, a socialised or fraternal state sphere. Another possible solution is, taking for granted that the household belongs to the private realm, to 'democratise' it in the sense that household relationships should take on the characteristics of democratic relationships, and that the household should take a form which is consistent with the freedom of all its members.

But for the ID project, the issue is not the dissolution of the private/public realm divide. The real issue is how, maintaining and enhancing the [[autonomy]] of the two realms, such institutional arrangements are adopted that introduce democracy at the household and the social realm in general (workplace, educational establishment etcetera) and at the same time enhance the institutional arrangements of political and economic democracy.  In this sense, an effective democracy is only conceivable if free time is equally distributed among all citizens, which requires ending the present hierarchical relations in the household, the workplace and elsewhere. Furthermore, democracy in the social realm, particularly in the household, requires institutional arrangements which recognise the character of the household as a need-satisfier and integrate the care and services that the household provides into the general scheme of needs satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Multidimensional-Crisis-ID-ch.15"&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/ss/ss.htm ''The Multidimensional Crisis and Inclusive Democracy''], (English translation of a book under the same title published in Greek, Gordios, 2005), ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological democracy===
[[Steven Best]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;in bold contrast to the limitations of the animal advocacy movement (AAM) and all other reformist causes, Takis Fotopoulos advances a broad view of human dynamics and social institutions, their impact on the earth, and the resulting consequences for society itself. Combining [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], radical democracy, and ecological concerns in the concept of "ecological democracy," Fotopoulos defines this notion as "the institutional framework which aims at the elimination of any human attempt to dominate the natural world, in other words, as the system which aims to reintegrate humans and Nature. This implies transcending the present 'instrumentalist' view of Nature, in which Nature is seen as an instrument for [[Economic growth|growth]], within a process of endless concentration of power.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best,[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol2/vol2_no3_Best_rethinking_revolution.htm "Rethinking Revolution: Animal Liberation, Human Liberation, and the Future of the Left"], ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy,'' Vol. 2, No. 3 (June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics of inclusive democracy ask what guarantees an inclusive democracy may offer in ensuring a better relationship of society to nature than the alternative systems of the market economy, or socialist statism. For example, David Pepper, an eco-socialist, pointed out "the 'required' ecological consensus among ecotopia's inhabitants might not be ensured merely by establishing an [[Athenian democracy]] where all are educated and rational".&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper, ''Modern Environmentalism'', p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ID supporters counter-argue that this criticism represents a clear misconception of what democracy is about because, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;if we see it as a process of social self-institution where there is no divinely or 'objectively' defined code of human conduct, such guarantees are by definition ruled out. Therefore, the replacement of the market economy by a new institutional framework of inclusive democracy constitutes only the necessary condition for a harmonious relation between the natural and social worlds. The sufficient condition refers to the citizens' level of ecological consciousness. Still, the radical change in the dominant social paradigm that would follow the institution of an inclusive democracy, combined with the decisive role that paedeia will play in an environmentally-friendly institutional framework, could reasonably be expected to lead to a radical change in the human attitude towards Nature.&lt;ref name="Multidimensional-Crisis-ID-ch.15"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supporters also claim that ID's institutional framework offers the best hope for a better human relationship to nature than could ever be achieved in a market economy, or one based on socialist statism. The factors supporting this view refer to all three elements of an inclusive democracy: political, economic and social.

Political democracy presupposes a radical decentralisation (physical or administrative) within a confederal society, which, by itself, should enhance its environmentally friendly character. Furthermore, political democracy would create a public space, a fact which would significantly reduce the appeal of [[materialism]] by providing a new meaning of life to fill the existential void that the present consumer society creates. Economic democracy replaces the dynamics of the capitalist market economy leading to growth per se with a new social dynamic aiming at the satisfaction of [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]' needs. If the satisfaction of demotic needs does not depend, as at present, on the continuous expansion of production to cover the 'needs' that the market system itself creates and if society is reintegrated with the economy, then there is no reason why the present instrumentalist view of nature will continue conditioning human behaviour. Particularly so, since unlike socialist models which are 'centralist', the aim of production in an Inclusive Democracy is not economic growth, but the satisfaction of the basic needs of the community and those non-basic needs for which members of the community express a desire and are willing to work extra for. This implies a new definition of [[economic efficiency]], based not on narrow techno-economic criteria of input minimisation/output maximisation as in socialist models like Parecon, but on criteria securing full coverage of the democratically defined basic needs of all citizens as well as of the non-basic needs they decide to meet, even if this involves a certain amount of [[Economic inefficiency|inefficiency]] according to the orthodox economics criteria.

According to ID supporters, democracy in the social realm should be a decisive step in the creation of the sufficient condition for a harmonious nature-society relationship, as the phasing out of [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] relations in the household and hierarchical relations in general should create a new ethos of non-domination which would engulf both nature and society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7260">[[File:Mouat_Cover.jpg|thumb|Title page of Mouat's book with an engraving based on a sketch of John Andaman by [[Colesworthey Grant]]. The illustration also appeared in Harper's Weekly and the Illustrated London News. Mouat claimed that Grant's picture depicted the "mild, gentle, and benevolent" expression perfectly.]]
'''John Andaman''' or '''Jack Andaman''' (captured January 1858 and returned in the same year) was the name given to an [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] native (or Mincopie as then termed) who was taken captive aboard a British navy ship near Interview Island on a survey of the Andaman Islands under [[Frederic J. Mouat]]. He was taken to Calcutta and returned to the place of his capture when ill health began to torment him. It has been suggested that Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] described Tonga, an Andamanese native character, in his 1890 novel ''[[The Sign of Four]]''  based on Mouat's description of John Andaman.
== Context and capture==
In 1858, a British survey was undertaken to identify a suitable penal colony to deal with the large numbers of prisoners taken in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. The Andaman Islands were chosen. Although the islands had been surveyed by [[Robert Hyde Colebrooke]] and [[Archibald Blair]] in the past, it had not been permanently settled by the British. The survey aboard the ''Pluto'' began in November 1857 and was led by Frederic J. Mouat, George Playfair and Lieutenant J.A. Heathcote. The team also included French photographer Oscar Mallitte. When the group landed on Interview Island (Long Reef Island), they had judged to be a safe and friendly island on the accounts of J.H. Quigley titled ''Wanderings in the Islands of Interview, (Andaman), Little and Great Coco'' (1850). Mouat had asked Quigley if he would be interested to join the mission but he had refused. Quigley had reported the islanders to be very friendly and had written fantastic accounts of tigers, deer and fabulous plants which later led Mouat to make comparisons of the author with [[Baron Munchausen]]. While ashore, the team was attacked by the natives armed with arrows. They made a rapid exit and a second armed navy [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] moved in to keep the natives away. Heathcote was injured by an arrow to the thigh and in defence Mouat was forced to shoot a man he called the "chief". The natives finally pulled back but not before at least three were killed of which two of the bodies were taken aboard the navy boat. One of the natives, a strong swimmer, had managed to get quite close to the boat and when offered a strap and rope, he took it and came aboard. The crew called him "Jack" and the captive found company in ''Neptune'', the dog aboard the ship, an animal he was unfamiliar with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=72–73, 238–260  |url=https://archive.org/stream/adventuresresear00moua#page/238/mode/2up/|author=Mouat, Frederic J. | year=1863| publisher=Hurst and Blackett| place=London| title=Adventures and researches among the Andaman Islanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calcutta==
In Calcutta, they found that John Andaman recognized none of the words in the vocabulary of the Andamanese compiled by R.H. Colebrooke. He imitated well and learnt to dress (to the point that he began to be ashamed of nudity, his original state), wash and always behaved with propriety. When shown a photograph of himself, he laughed and turned it around to see if his back was seen as well. [[Charlotte Canning, Countess Canning|Lady Canning]] wrote that he was "gentle and tractable and imitates everything and is amused at everything from a glass of water upwards". Pictures of John Andaman appeared in many places including the ''Illustrated London News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2010.07.001|title=Colonization, kidnap and confinement in the Andamans penal colony, 1771–1864|journal=Journal of Historical Geography|volume=37|pages=68|year=2011|last1=Anderson|first1=Clare}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Careful anthropological measurements were taken of John and published in the journals of various scholarly journals.&lt;ref name=owen /&gt;

Mouat had photos of the two dead natives taken (and a copy went to [[Alexander von Humboldt]] who confirmed them to as "Negrilloes") and their skulls were preserved and taken with him to London where they were studied and described by Professor [[Richard Owen]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=owen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Osteology and Dentition of the Aborigines of the Andaman Islands, and the Relations Thereby Indicated to Other Races of Mankind| author=Owen, Richard| journal=Transactions of the Ethnological Society of London| volume=2| year=1863| pages=34–49| jstor=3014305 |url=https://archive.org/stream/transactionseth01londgoog#page/n50/mode/1up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As for John Andaman, the government report stated:&lt;ref name=govt&gt;{{cite book|title=Selections from the Records of the Government of India (Home Department). Number XXV. The Andaman Islands; with notes on Barren Island| place=Calcutta| publisher=Baptist Mission Press| year=1859 |pages=19 |url=https://archive.org/stream/TheAndamanIslands/The%20Andaman%20Islands#page/n37/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|One of the natives, when in the water, seized a strap thrown to him from the second cutter, and was taken on board. The Committee deliberated anxiously as to disposal of this man, whether to release, or to carry him to Calcutta. They ultimately decided on the latter course as the one required by the interests of humanity, although attended with hardship to the individual, until he can he instructed sufficiently to know the reasons which led to his removal from his country and his kindred.}}

== Repatriation ==

John suffered in Calcutta and frequently took ill. He had cholera and then a lung infection leading to a decision by the Governor General to have him sent back from where he had been taken. There had been hope that he would spread the message of his captors' kindness among the natives with whom the British had failed to make any peace. Nothing was heard again about John.&lt;ref name=owen /&gt;

Fifty copies of the photographs taken by Oscar Mallitte both on the journey to the Andamans as well as at Calcutta were made and these were thought to have been lost until one set was discovered in 2005 by a new curator appointed to the Queen's Collection at Windsor Castle. The set includes three photos of John Andaman including one in which he is dressed in a navy uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=History Workshop Journal|year= 2009|volume= 67 |issue=1|pages= 152–172| title= Oscar Mallitte's Andaman Photographs, 1857–8|author=Anderson, Clare|doi=10.1093/hwj/dbn078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''The Sign of Four'' (1890), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses deprecating language almost identical to that used by Mouat to describe the character Tonga, an Andamanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sign of Four|author=Doyle, Arthur Conan| publisher=Broadview Press| year=2010| page=35|editor=Towheed, Shafquat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}
'''Kirunapartiet''' (The Kiruna Party) is a local [[political party]] in [[Kiruna Municipality]], Sweden. It was founded in 1994 as a splinter group of the local branch of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and was led by [[Lars Törnman]] from 1994 until 2010, when Törnman left the party for the Social Democrats. After Törnman's leaving the party, Henry Emmoth was selected as its new leader.

In the municipal elections in 1994, Kirunapartiet got 33% of the total vote, which meant that the party was the largest of the parties in the municipal government, and got the right to appoint the [[municipal commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kuriren.nu/nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=4156420 Kirunapartiet: En historisk tillbakablick] ''[[Norrbottens-Kuriren]]'' 12 September 2008, retrieved 14 November 2010 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It held this right until 2006, when the Social Democrats received more votes in the municipal elections of that year. Following Törnman's realignment and a (failed) internal attempt to dissolve the party in favor of a stronger Social Democratic party, the municipal election of 2010 resulted in poor figures for the party.

The Kiruna Party attempted to reach [[Riksdag|parliament]] in 2002 (as a part of the [[Norrbotten Party]] ticket) and [[Norrbotten County]] [[County council|council]] in 2002 and 2006, respectively. In 2006, the party failed by a mere 137 votes to gain representation.

'''Land and Liberty''' ({{lang-es|"Tierra y Libertad"}}, {{lang-ru|Zemlya i Volya}}) is an [[anarchist]] slogan. It was originally used as a name of the Russian revolutionary organization [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Zemlya i Volya]] in 1878, then by the revolutionary leaders of the [[Mexican Revolution]]; the revolution was fought over land rights, and the leaders such as [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] were fighting to give the land back to the natives from whom it was expropriated either by force or by some dubious manner. Without land, the peasants were at the mercy of landowners for subsistence.

Similarly, during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the main concern of the peasants was to free themselves from subservience to landowners, to get a plot of land if they had none, or to expand on their land holdings. Consequently, the Russian peasants welcomed the Russian Revolution under the banner "Zemlya i Volya": "Land and Liberty".

The slogan of "Tierra y Libertad" was also used during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] (1936–1939). In 1995, a film covering the [[Spanish Civil War]] was released with the title ''[[Land and Freedom]]''.

== Meaning ==

In a narrow sense, the possession of land meant freedom from the landowner. And this may have been the main concern of both the Mexican and Russian peasants.

In a broader sense, the slogan can be interpreted to mean that the necessary (though not the sufficient) condition of liberty is something like possession or access to subsistence land. If possession or access to land is a necessary condition of liberty, then its deprivation results in some form of slavery: [[tenancy]], [[sharecropping]], [[wage-slavery]]. Access to land is only a necessary condition because even with access, the government may impose taxes to such an extent that one is not free. For example, in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932–1933, the government was removing from the peasants their agricultural products to the extant that it produced an artificial{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} famine which directly or indirectly killed roughly 2.582 million&lt;ref name="Vallin2"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jacques Vallin |author2=France Mesle |author3=Serguei Adamets |author4=Serhii Pyrozhkov  | doi=10.1080/00324720215934 |title=A New Estimate of Ukrainian Population Losses during the Crises of the 1930s and 1940s |journal=[[Population Studies]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |date=November 2002 |pages=249–264 |jstor=3092980 |pmid=12553326}}&lt;/ref&gt; people only in [[Ukraine]]. (See [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].) So, the possession of or access to subsistence land is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for liberty.

In the following passage, [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] points out the relation of the possession of land to liberty:
"In former times the marauding minority of mankind, by means of physical violence, compelled the working majority to render feudal services, or reduced them to a state of slavery or serfdom, or at least made them pay a tribute. Nowadays the dependence of the working classes is secured in a less direct but equally efficacious manner, viz. by means of the superior power of capital; the labourer being forced, in order to get his subsistence, to place his labour power entirely at the disposal of the capitalist. So there is a semblance of liberty; but in reality the labourer is exploited and subjected, because, all the land having been appropriated, he cannot procure his subsistence directly from nature, and, goods being produced for the market and not for the producer's own use, he cannot subsist without capital. Wages will rise above what is wanted for the necessaries of life, where the labourer is able to earn his subsistence on free land, which has not yet become private property. But wherever, in an old and totally occupied country, a body of labouring poor is employed in manufactures, the same law, which we see at work in the struggle for life throughout the organized world, will keep wages at the absolute minimum".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Albert Lange]], ''Die Arbeiterfrage. Ihre Bedeutung für Gegenwart und Zukunft''. Vierte Auflage. 1861, pp.&amp;nbsp;12, 13. Quoted by H. J. Nieboer, [http://www.ditext.com/nieboer/title.html ''Slavery: As an Industrial System''] (Ethnological Researches), 2nd edition, 1909, p.&amp;nbsp;421.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appropriation as title ==
''Land and Liberty'' is the title of a publication produced in Britain by the supporters of the land value taxation programme described by Henry George in his book ''Progress and Poverty''. The journal was first published towards the end of the nineteenth century, originally under the name "Land Values". It was given its present title just before World War I. At present, the journal is quarterly. Articles are mostly about economics and political topics, with special reference to their relationship to land tenure and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;An almost-complete archive of Land Values and ''Land and Liberty'' is held at the library of [http://www.schooleconomicscience.org The School of Economic Science] in Mandeville Place, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|de|'''Landesrabbiner'''}}{{efn|Variant terms: ''Landrabbiner'', ''Oberlandesrabbiner''.}} ({{IPA-de|ˈlandəs.ʁaˌbiːnɐ|lang}}; {{lang-he|רב מדינה|Rav Medinah}}) are [[spiritual leader|spiritual head]]s of the [[History of the Jews in Europe|Jewish communities]] of a country, province, or district, [[History of the Jews in Germany|particularly in Germany and Austria]]. The office is a result of the legal condition of the Jews in medieval times when the Jewish communities formed a unit for the purposes of taxation. As the community had to pay certain taxes to the government, the latter had to appoint some one who should be responsible to it for their prompt collection, and who consequently had to be invested with a certain authority. The office of ''Landesrabbiner'' had no ecclesiastical meaning until the 18th century, when the various governments began to consider it their duty to care for the spiritual welfare of the Jews. Such ecclesiastical authority, owing to the strictly congregational constitution of the communities, never took root among the Jews (see, however, on the [[chief rabbinate]] of [[Moravia]] after the death of [[Marcus Benedict]], [[Moses Sofer]], [[Responsa]], [[Oraḥ Ḥayyim]], 13).

== Earliest Data ==
The transfer of the Jews from the status of imperial to that of territorial subjects, provided by the charter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] of Austria (1244) and recognized by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles IV]] in his [[Golden bull]] (1356), as well as their very frequent expulsion from the large cities in the 15th and 16th centuries, scattered the Jews in small communities. These were without protection against the arbitrary action of petty tyrants; and they caused the rulers considerable inconvenience owing to constant litigation concerning encroachments on the rights of Jews living under their protection. Therefore the Jews of a given territory organized themselves into an association which elected an advocate ("[[Shtadlan]]") for the protection of their interests. Such an official was recognized by the government as the legal representative of the Jews, whose duty it was to see that the taxes imposed on the Jews as a body were promptly paid, that the laws against usury were obeyed, and who in turn was given jurisdiction in civil cases. This jurisdiction, which he exercised either personally if a scholar or through his deputy if not one, gave the Landesrabbiner an authority within the community. Inasmuch as the Jews from the sixteenth century lived almost exclusively in small communities and could not maintain a rabbi or a rabbinical court (which consisted of three members in every settlement), several communities in a district combined to do so. To this condition of things may be attributed the real creation of the office of ''Landesrabbiner'', the former attempts to appoint a chief rabbi over all the Jews of a country—e.g., in Germany by Emperor [[Rupert of Germany|Rupert]] in 1407, and in Spain, France, and [[Portugal]], partly in the 14th, partly in the 15th, century—having been mostly abortive, and at all events merely fiscal measures designed for the purpose of tax-collecting (see [[Heinrich Grätz]], "''Gesch.''" viii. 8, 102, [[et passim]]; [[Scherer]], ''"Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden"'', p.&amp;nbsp;258; [[Bishop of the Jews]]; [[Hochmeister]]). The first Landesrabbiner of whom there is authentic record is [[Judah Löw ben Bezaleel]], of whom his contemporary [[David Gans]] says that he was for 20 years (1553–73) the spiritual head ("ab bet din") of all the Jewish congregations in the province of Moravia (''"[[Ẓemaḥ Dawid]]"'', year 5352).

== From the 17th century ==
At the time of Löw ben Bezaleel the congregations of Moravia were evidently very small. They were composed of refugees who through the influence of [[Capistrano]] had been expelled from the large cities like [[Brünn]] and [[Olmütz]] (1454) and had settled where any well-disposed lord would receive them under his protection. As they formed communities too small to engage a well-qualified rabbi, they elected to act as their judge one having his seat in one of the largest congregations of the province. Similar conditions prevailed elsewhere. The Jews living in the principality of [[Bamberg]] obtained in 1619 permission to elect a "Paumeister oder obristen Rabbi", and they may have had such an official earlier ([[Eckstein]], ''"Gesch. der Juden im Ehemaligen Fürstbistum Bamberg"'', pp.&amp;nbsp;62, 157, Bamberg, 1898). The communities of the {{Interlanguage link multi|County of Oettingen|de|3=Grafschaft Oettingen|lt=Principality of Oettingen}}, also formed from refugees of larger cities like [[Nördlingen]], had a ''Landesrabbiner'' from early times (Müller, ''"Aus Fünf Jahrhunderten"'', p.&amp;nbsp;171, [[Augsburg]], 1900). The Jews living under the protection of the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop of Mayence]] had in 1718 [[Issachar Berush Eskeles]] as their ''Landesrabbiner'' ([[Bamberger]], ''"Historische Berichte über die Juden . . . [[Aschaffenburg]]"'', p.&amp;nbsp;18, [[Strasbourg]], 1900). The title was occasionally conferred as a sign of distinction; thus [[Samson Wertheimer]] received in 1717 from Emperor Charles VI. the title of ''Landesrabbiner'' of Hungary ("pro archi sive superiori Judæorum Rabbino"). His son-in-law, the above-named Eskeles, who (although he resided in Vienna, being connected with his father-in-law's banking business there) had succeeded his father, [[Gabriel Eskeles]], as ''Landesrabbiner'' of Moravia, was appointed (1725) at Wertheimer's death his successor as ''Landesrabbiner'' of Hungary ([[Kaufmann]], ''"Samson Wertheimer"'', p.&amp;nbsp;104, [[Vienna]], 1888; [[Wurzbach]], ''"Biographisches Lexikon"'', s.v. "Eskeles").

== As Spiritual Chiefs ==
In the course of the 18th century various governments attempted to influence the internal condition of the Jewish communities, and for this reason legislated with regard to their congregational constitutions. Typical in this respect is [[Maria Theresa]], who in her "General-Polizei-Prozess und Kommercialordnung für die Judenschaft" of Moravia (December 29, 1753) prescribes in detail the duties of the ''Landesrabbiner''; e.g., that he shall assign the tractate which all other rabbis shall adopt for instruction; bestow the title of ''"Doppelter Reb" ("[[Morenu]]")''; see that all taxes are promptly paid; and arrange the complicated election of a new official.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willibald Müller]] (ed.), ''Urkundliche Beiträge zur Geschichte der mährischen Judenschaft im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert'', Olmütz and Leipzig: Kullil and Harassowitz, 1903, pp.&amp;nbsp;86–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Other provinces were to have a ''Landesrabbiner''. Indeed, the empress appointed one for [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], but he had no successor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salomon Buber]], ''Ansche Schem: Biographien und Leichensteininschriften von Rabbinen, Lehrhausvorstehern, Religionsweisern, Rabbinatsassesoren und Gemeindevorstehern, die während eines Zeitraumes von vierhundert Jahren (1500 - 1890) in Lemberg lehrten und wirkten'', [[Kraków]]: self-published, 1895, pp.&amp;nbsp;xix et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany it was chiefly in the small states, where the governments directed all affairs, that the institution was established. [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Cassel]] had a ''"Landesrabbinat"'', which was a board constituted on the same basis as the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|Protestant consistory]], but with a ''Landesrabbiner'' as presiding officer. Its establishment was decreed in 1823. Hanover made similar provisions in the law of 1844 on Jewish affairs. Up to 1938&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Schneider, ''Die jüdische Gemeinde in Hildesheim : 1871 - 1942'', Hildesheim: Stadtarchiv, 2003, (=Schriftenreihe des Stadtarchivs und der Stadtbibliothek Hildesheim / Stadtarchiv und Stadtbibliothek Hildesheim. - Hildesheim: Gerstenberg, 1978- ; vol.&amp;nbsp;31), simultaneously: Göttingen, Univ., PhD., 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;4 in chap.&amp;nbsp;'IV. Schlußbetrachtung'. {{ISBN|3-931987-11-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it has had 4 ''Landrabbiner''s, at [[Hanover]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Land Rabbinate of Hanover|de|3=Landrabbinat Hannover}}, est. 1687), [[Hildesheim]] (est. 1842), [[Stade]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Land Rabbinate of Stade|nds|3=Landrabbinat Stood}}, est. 1842; since 1860 served per pro by the land rabbis of Hanover and Emden alternately) and [[Emden]] (est. 1827).&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Löb, ''Die Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden im ehemaligen Königreiche und der jetzigen Provinz Hannover'', Frankfurt upon Main: Kauffmann, 1908, pp.&amp;nbsp;57seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Specially typical conditions existed in the [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], where the government established the institution of ''Landesrabbiner'' May 14, 1839, continuing the 1764-established chief rabbinate for the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. Here the rabbis ([[Samuel Holdheim]] and [[David Einhorn (rabbi)|David Einhorn]]) were at first supposed to introduce radical reforms, but after the revolution of 1848, when the policy of the government became reactionary, the 1853-newly elected rabbi {{Interlanguage link multi|Baruch Isaak Lipschütz|de}} was intended to strengthen "historic Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Donath, ''Geschichte der Juden in [[Mecklenburg]] von den ältesten Zeiten (1266) bis auf die Gegenwart (1874)'', [[Leipzig|Leipsic]]: Leiner, 1874, pp.&amp;nbsp;221 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saxe-Weimar]] the government used the ''Landesrabbiner'' to enforce the law of June 20, 1823, which ordered that services be held in German (see Hess, Mendel). In [[Saxe-Meiningen]] the Landesrabbinat was organized by the law of Jan. 5, 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Armin Human, ''Geschichte der Juden im Herzogthum S.[achsen]-Meiningen-Hildburghausen'', (=Schriften des Vereins für Sachsen-Meiningische Geschichte und Landeskunde; vol.&amp;nbsp;30), [[Hildburghausen]]: Kesselring, 1898, pp.&amp;nbsp;69 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Here as elsewhere in the small German states the object of the institution was to raise the moral and intellectual status of the Jews.

== In the 19th century ==
By the 19th century, only some of the small states of Germany still had a ''Landesrabbiner'', namely, [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], [[Oldenburg]], [[Birkenfeld]], [[Saxe-Meiningen]], [[Anhalt]], [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]], and [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]]. [[Prussia]], which always proclaimed the principle of non-interference in internal Jewish affairs, retained the office in some of the provinces annexed in 1866, as the 4 Landrabbinate in the [[Province of Hanover]] and in the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]] ([[Kassel|Cassel]]). The office of ''Landesrabbiner'' for the [[province of Brandenburg]], which existed in Berlin and in [[Frankfort-on-the-Oder]], survived, as in other countries, up to the end of the 18th century by virtue of the rabbi's capacity as [[civil judge]]. The last one to hold the title was [[Hirschel Lewin]], while his successor, [[Simon Mayer Weyl]] (d. 1828), held the title of ''"Vice[-]ober[-]landesrabbiner"''. As an exceptional favor the government in 1849 gave to [[Gedaliah Tiktin]] of [[Breslau]] the title of ''Landesrabbiner'', which was interpreted as a manifestation of the government in favor of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]] and as a disapproval of the [[Reform Judaism|Reform movement]] ([[L. Geiger]], ''"[[Abraham Geiger]]'s Leben in Briefen"'', pp.&amp;nbsp;113 et seq., Berlin, 1878).

In Austria [[Samson Hirsch]] held the office for the [[Margraviate of Moravia|province of Moravia]] from 1847 to 1851. He was elected according to the complicated method prescribed in the law issued by Maria Theresa. At the time of his resignation the legal position of the Jewish communities was in a state of chaos owing to the events of 1848, which had played havoc with the principles on which the legislation rested. The government then appointed as substitute [[Abraham Placzek]] of [[Boskowitz]], who in his last years had his son [[Baruch Placzek]] of [[Brünn]] appointed as his assistant. An attempt made by Baron [[Moritz Königswarter]], who was a member of the [[Reichsrat (Austria)#House of Lords|House of Lords]], to introduce into the law of 1890 regulating the legal status of the Austrian Jewish congregations a clause reestablishing the office of ''Landesrabbiner'' of Moravia was defeated in the [[lower house]] of the ''[[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]]h'' ([[Löw]], ''"Das Mährische Landesrabbinat"'', in ''"Gesammelte Schriften"'', ii. 215–218, [[Szegedin]], 1890; [[D'Elvert]], ''"Zur Gesch. der Juden in Mähren und [[Austrian Silesia|Oesterreich. Schlesien]]"'', pp.&amp;nbsp;209–211, Brünn, 1895; [[Willibald Müller]], ''"Beiträge zur Geschichte der Mährischen Judenschaft"'', pp.&amp;nbsp;157–165, Olmütz, 1903). Baruch Placzek is, however, officially addressed by the government authorities as ''"Landesrabbiner"''; he recently appointed [[Solomon Funk]], rabbi of Boskowitz, as his substitute, an appointment which the government confirmed (''"[[Oesterr. Wochenschrift]]"'', 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;190). The office existed also in [[Siebenbürgen]] early in the 19th century.

A similar institution is that of '''''Chief Rabbi''''' of the [[United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire]], which, however, rests exclusively on voluntary acknowledgement on the part of the congregations, and does not extend over whole groups of congregations like the Portuguese, the Reform, and the Polish organizations. The office of the '''''Grand Rabbin''' du Consistoire Central'' in France is also of similar nature, but differs in that the chief rabbi acts merely in his capacity as member of the [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistory]], and not as hierarchic chief.

The '''Liberal Republican Party of the United States''' was an American [[political party]] that was organized in May 1872 to oppose the reelection of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and his [[Radical Republican]] supporters in the [[United States presidential election, 1872|presidential election of 1872]]. The party emerged in Missouri under the leadership of Senator [[Carl Schurz]] and soon attracted other opponents of Grant. The party opposed Grant's [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policies and sought [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]]. It lost in a landslide and disappeared after the 1872 election.

The [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] had emerged as the dominant party in the aftermath of the Civil War, but many original Republicans became dissatisfied with the leadership of President Grant. Prominent Liberal leaders like Schurz, [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Lyman Trumbull]] had been leaders in the fight against slavery and for the first stages of Reconstruction. They considered the job done and by 1872 demanded an end to Reconstruction and a restoration of  self-government to the South.  Liberal Republicans decried the scandals of the Grant administration and sought civil service reform.

The [[1872 Liberal Republican convention]] nominated a ticket consisting of [[Horace Greeley]], longtime publisher of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]''; and Missouri Governor [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]]. Seeking to defeat Grant, the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] nominated the Liberal Republican ticket and endorsed the Liberal Republican platform. However, Grant emerged triumphant in the election, capitalizing on superior party organization. Democrats lacked of enthusiasm for Greeley, who for decades had denounced them. Greeley received 44% of the popular vote, winning the states of Texas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Maryland. Grant received 286 of the 352 [[electoral college]] votes.  Greeley died shortly after the election.

The Liberal Republican Party vanished immediately after the election, though a handful of its leaders continued to serve in Congress. Former Liberals party members scattered into the Democratic and Republican parties.  By cutting the allegiance of liberal elements to the Republican Party, the Liberal Republicans made it possible for many of these leaders, such as Schurz, to move to the Democratic Party.

==History of the party==
[[File:1872 Cincinnati Convention of Liberal Republicans (cropped).jpg|thumb|Interior of the convention hall during the announcement of [[Horace Greeley]] as the [[1872 Liberal Republican convention|party's nominee for President in 1872]]]]

===Formation===
The party began in Missouri in 1870 under the leadership of [[Carl Schurz]] and spread nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; It had strong support from powerful Republican newspaper editors such as [[Murat Halstead]] of the ''Cincinnati Commercial'', [[Horace White (writer)|Horace White]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', [[Henry Watterson]] of the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'', [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles]] of the ''[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Springfield Republican]]'' and especially [[Whitelaw Reid]] and [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New-York Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Many Liberal Republican leaders had been Democrats and members of the [[Free Soil Party]] before joining the Republican Party after its creation in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 730-731&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Republicans thought that the Grant administration and the President personally were fully corrupt. More important they thought that the goals of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] had been achieved. These goals were first the destruction of slavery and second the destruction of Confederate nationalism. With these goals achieved the tenets of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] demanded that federal military troops be removed from the South, where they were propping up allegedly corrupt Republican regimes. Many of the original founders of the Republican party and leaders of the Civil War joined the movement, including its nominee [[Horace Greeley]], [[Charles Sumner]] of Massachusetts, [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois, [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (1810–1903)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]] of Kentucky and [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] of Massachusetts. The party platform demanded "the immediate and absolute removal of all disabilities imposed on account of the rebellion" and local self-government for the southern states. It regarded "a thorough [[Civil Service Reform Act|reform of the civil service]] as one of the most pressing necessities of the hour". Many Liberal Republicans also sought a downward revision of the [[tariffs in United States history|tariff]], believing that powerful industries had unfairly won the [[Protectionism|protection]] of certain goods.&lt;ref name="Ross 1910"&gt;Ross (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Republicans believed in civil and political rights for African Americans and argued that goal had been achieved. Hence, now they said it was time for "amnesty", which meant restoring the right to vote and hold office to ex Confederates.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Burg, "Amnesty, Civil Rights, and the Meaning of Liberal Republicanism, 1862-1872". ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 2003 4(3): 29-60.&lt;/ref&gt; A key motivation for many Liberal Republicans was a belief in [[states' rights]] and a fear of a strong federal government.&lt;ref name="mdinunzio1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiNunzio|first1=Mario R.|title=Lyman Trumbull, the States' Rights Issue, and the Liberal Republican Revolt|journal=Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society (1908-1984)|date=Winter 1973|volume=66|issue=4|pages=364–375|jstor=40190731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Liberal Republicans had joined the Republican Party in the 1850s in opposition to the expansion of slavery into the territories, but with slavery no longer an issue and the Civil War over other issues such as federal power re-emerged.&lt;ref name="mdinunzio1"/&gt; Many of the Liberal Republicans, including Trumbull, had opposed the [[impeachment of Andrew Johnson]] and were wary of an upset of the traditional constitutional balance of power.&lt;ref name="mdinunzio1"/&gt;

Led by Schurz, judge [[Stanley Matthews (lawyer)|Stanley Matthews]] and editor William Grosvenor, the Liberal Republican Party organized a [[1872 Liberal Republican convention|national convention]] in Cincinnati in May 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 730-731&lt;/ref&gt; In Missouri, Democrats and Liberal Republicans had successfully [[Missouri gubernatorial election, 1870|defeated]] the incumbent Republican governor and the Liberal Republicans hoped to nominate a presidential candidate who could likewise win the support of Democrats.&lt;ref name=witcover/&gt; Though Schurz had founded the party, he was ineligible to run for President as he had been born in Germany and instead became the chairman of the convention. Those who attended the convention had various motivations, though all were united in opposition to Grant. Many delegates were attracted to the party's support for civil service reform and an end to Reconstruction. Others like [[Reuben Fenton]] hoped to recapture control of state party organizations. In Missouri, the Liberal Republicans had become established as a major party, but the other states lacked a party organization and their delegations were little more than self-appointed committees.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 734-736&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering the convention, Supreme Court Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois and former Congressman [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] of Massachusetts were among the major candidates for the presidential nomination.&lt;ref name=witcover&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witcover|first1=Jules|title=Party of the People|date=2003|publisher=Random House|pages=241–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schurz favored Adams, but was unwilling to publicly back a candidate as he wished to retain the appearance of impartiality. Davis entered the week of the convention with perhaps the strongest backing, but saw his candidacy damaged by unfavorable coverage from newspapers aligned with the Liberal Republican movement.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 737-738&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper publisher [[Horace Greeley]] of New York won the support of many former Davis backers, despite some concern about his lack of support for tariff reduction.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 741-743&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first ballot of the convention, Adams and Greeley emerged as the two strongest contenders for the nomination. Most delegates voted for Adams or Greeley on subsequent ballots, though Trumbull retained significant support. On the sixth and final ballot, Greeley picked up just enough to clinch the nomination. Following the presidential nomination, the convention chose Missouri Governor [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] as the party's vice presidential nominee. Brown had supported Greeley's nomination as a way to increase his power within the state party at the expense of Schurz and Brown won the support of most pro-Greeley delegates on the vice presidential ballot.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, pp. 741-750&lt;/ref&gt;

===1872 campaign===
{{see also|United States presidential election, 1872|Horace Greeley presidential campaign, 1872}}
Prior to the Liberal Republican convention, Democratic leaders had given the Liberal Republicans assurances that they would nominate the Liberal Republican ticket. The Democrats believed that they could not win the 1872 election without anti-Grant Republicans and Democratic leaders hoped that they would reap patronage rewards from a Liberal Republican presidency. However, Democratic leaders were dismayed by the nomination of Greeley. Many Southern Democrats were eager to elect any candidate that might put an end to Grant's Reconstruction policies, but Greeley's frequent attacks on the Democratic Party had earned the enmity of many Democrats, especially in the Northeast.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 129-135&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these qualms, most Democrats decided that Greeley was better than Grant and represented their only chance to defeat the Republican President. Though several state conventions endured considerable debate, every state Democratic convention other than Delaware's convention ultimately endorsed Greeley. By a wide margin, the July [[1872 Democratic National Convention]] voted to endorse the Liberal Republican ticket and accept the party's platform without modification. After the convention, a group of disaffected Democrats led by [[Blanton Duncan]] nominated [[Charles O'Conor (American politician)|Charles O'Conor]] and [[John Quincy Adams II]] on the [[Straight-Out Democratic Party]] ticket, but both refused the nomination and neither actively campaigned.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 129-141, 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Republican Party fused with the Democratic Party in all states except for Louisiana and Texas. In states where Republicans were stronger, the Liberal Republicans fielded a majority of the joint slate of candidates for lower offices; while in states where Democrats were stronger, the Democrats fielded the most candidates. In many states, such as Ohio, each party nominated half of a joint slate of candidates. Even initially reluctant Democratic leaders like [[Thomas F. Bayard]] came to support Greeley.&lt;ref name="Ross 1910"/&gt;

The 1872 campaign was primarily conducted on personalities rather than issues, with Greeley and Grant both sustaining numerous personal attacks.&lt;ref name=ross150160/&gt; Greeley favored protectionism and did not emphasize civil service reform, two of the motivating issues for the party's founders. Greeley attacked many of Grant's many appointments as corrupt, but Greeley's past associations with Republican leaders undermined the corruption argument.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 167-169&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Liberal Republican leaders like Schurz and Sumner coalesced behind Greeley and most actively campaigned for the party's nominee.&lt;ref name=ross150160&gt;Ross, pp. 150-160&lt;/ref&gt; Grant's backers accused the Liberal Republicans of seeking to overturn the results of the Civil War and the Republicans mobilized veteran's organizations in support of Grant. Liberal Republicans argued that they sought reconciliation of North and South and that the time had come to end radical Reconstruction policies.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 173-176&lt;/ref&gt; Each party sought to appeal to African Americans, with the Liberal Republican appeal centering on Greeley's long history of abolitionism. However, [[Fredrick Douglass]] successfully organized blacks in support of Grant.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 163-165&lt;/ref&gt; Many inside and outside of the Liberal Republican Party believed that their coalition would triumph in the 1872 election and the outcome of the election remained in doubt until October.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 177-183&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Republicans utilized superior organization, the backing of financiers like [[Jay Cooke]] and lingering Democratic doubts about Greeley to win most elections throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 184-190&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election, Greeley won 43.8% of the popular vote and just 66 of the 352 electoral votes, while O'Conor won 0.3% of the popular vote. Greeley died on November 29, 1872 before the presidential electors met on December 4 to cast the electoral votes. The Greeley electors were not able to coordinate their votes before meeting, but their action made no difference in the face of Grant's [[electoral college]] landslide.&lt;ref&gt;Most Greeley electors (42 of 66) voted for Thomas A. Hendricks for President. Greeley electors who were Liberal Republicans cast 18 electoral votes for B. Gratz Brown (8 in Missouri, 6 in Georgia, and 4 in Kentucky). Two Greeley electors voted for Charles Jenkins, one for David Davis, and three electors (in Georgia) voted for Greeley, even though he had died. Congress refused to count the three electoral votes cast for Greeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Although the Liberal Republican Party did not survive Greeley's death, several of its reforms materialized in the following decade. Reform Republicans accomplished the nomination and then election of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]], who brought Reconstruction to an end and removed some of the more offensive of Grant's appointments. The Liberal Republican call for civil service reform was passed during the administration of President [[Chester Arthur]].&lt;ref name="Ross 1910"/&gt; However, Greeley's relatively poor performance (he fared worse than [[Horatio Seymour]] had in [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868]]) also put an end to the Democratic experiment with fusion tickets.&lt;ref name=witcover/&gt;

Though the national party organization disappeared, several Liberal Republican members continued to serve in Congress after the 1872 elections. While those in the House were allowed to keep their committee assignments and chairmanships, Liberal Republican Senators became de facto independents and received inferior committee assignments. Most Liberal Republican Congressmen eventually joined the Democratic Party. Outside of the South, some Liberal Republicans sought the creation of a new party opposed to Republicans, but Democrats were unwilling to abandon their old party affiliation and even relatively successful efforts like Wisconsin's [[Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)|Reform Party]] collapsed. Even the Missouri Liberal Republican Party collapsed as the Democrats became the major opposition party to the Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 192-230&lt;/ref&gt;

Democrats won several seats in Congress and numerous other offices in the [[United States elections, 1874|1874 elections]], aided by dissatisfaction with Grant and the defection of former Liberal Republicans. As Republicans became increasingly worried about their chances in the [[United States elections, 1876|1876 elections]], they courted former Liberal Republican leaders like Schurz and Fenton. Both parties made direct appeals to former Liberal Republicans in the 1876 elections and former party supporters split roughly evenly between the two presidential candidates. Schurz actively campaigned for Hayes and became the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]] after Hayes won the election. In the following years, former Liberal Republicans became members in good standing of both major parties. In the 1880s, many would join the [[Mugwumps|Mugwump]] movement in opposition to [[James G. Blaine]]. Many also joined the [[Greenback Party]], which sought inflationary policies and labor reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, pp. 230-239&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:Cincinnati Convention of Liberal Republicans.png|thumb|[[Thomas Nast]]'s caricature of the [[1856 Democratic National Convention|Cincinnati Convention]] from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', April 13, 1872]]
Historian Richard Gerber (1975) argues that most authors and historians portray the Liberal Republicans as an aberration, noting the many unresolved issues of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. He groups the historical interpretations of the party that prevailed after 1872 into two main categories. One historical interpretation emphasizes the Liberal Republican push for the re-establishment of self-government in the South and the restoration of national unity. The second interpretation sees the Liberal Republicans as primarily motivated by opposition to the corruption of the Grant administration and support for lower tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1975), pp. 40-42, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Downey (1967) argues Greeley was nominated as a result of a crass political bargain imposed against the will of a convention that really wanted Charles Francis Adams. Men like Schurz supported Adams, but were inexperienced political idealists and not professional politicians. They neither acted nor voted as a bloc, particularly after the collapse of a boom for David Davis, a collapse engineered by a group of leading reformist Republican editors. The shift of particular votes to Greeley was not decisive, but the feeling of the delegates that Adams could not win support among Irish workers, the Western masses, or Democratic voters.&lt;ref&gt;Downey (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lunde (1978) argues Grant supporters hailed the Civil War as a great triumph which had bound the United States into a united nation, linked not only by sentiment but by rapidly increasing networks of railroads. The Democrats and their Liberal Republican allies thought the war was a tragedy, recoiled against centralization and sought to recapture the purity of prewar days through reconciliation and respect for the autonomy of the states. Greeley's benevolent image of nationalism was defeated by the centralizing, "blood and iron" concept of Grant.&lt;ref&gt;Lunde (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

McPherson (1972) argues that three-quarters of ex abolitionists favored Grant, although such antislavery Republicans as Charles Francis Adams, Carl Schurz and Charles Sumner were key supporters of Greeley. Focused on the welfare of the freedmen, abolitionists were appalled by Greeley's formula for cooperation with "better class" southern whites by granting amnesty to all Confederates and adopting a hands-off policy toward the South. They supported Grant in the belief that his Southern policy promised the best protection for the African Americans. Most abolitionists believed that, moral suasion having failed earlier, true equality could be achieved only through relentless law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Slap (2006) redeems the reputation of the Liberal Republicans from allegations of opportunism (as presented by [[Ari Hoogenboom]]), of elitism (as presented by John G. Sproat) and racism as presented by the [[Neoabolitionism|neoabolitionists]].  He joins Heather Cox Richardson and David Quigley in concluding that Reconstruction ended not because of politicized violence in the South, but because of the Northern decision that the war goals had been achieved and it would thwart [[Republicanism in the United States|republican ideals]] to continue Army rule of the South.

'''Liberal corporatism''' is the application of economic [[corporatism]] by [[Liberalism|liberal]] political parties and organizations, that recognizes the bargaining interests of multiple groups within society, such as in the business, labour, and agricultural sectors and licenses them to engage in bargaining over economic policy with the state.&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999. P36"&gt;Frank Bealey, Richard A. Chapman, Michael Sheehan. ''Elements in political science''. Edinburgh, UK: Edinburgh University Press, 1999. P36. {{ISBN|0748611096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal corporatism is often in conflict from proponents of liberal [[Ontological pluralism|pluralism]] that opposes the granting of power to organized [[interest group]]s.&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999. P36"/&gt; English liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] supported corporatist-like economic associations as needing to predominate in society to create equality for labourers and give them a voice in management through democratic economic rights.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Samuel. ''The commercial society: foundations and challenges in a global age''. Lanham,USA; Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, 2007. Pp. 109. {{ISBN|073911994X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a number of other forms of corporatism, liberal corporatism does not reject capitalism or [[individualism]], but believes that the capitalist firm is a social institution that requires its managers to go beyond achieving the [[Net income|bottom line]], by recognizing the needs of their members.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"&gt;Waring, Stephen P. ''Taylorism Transformed: Scientific Management Theory Since 1945''. University of North Carolina Press, 1994. Pp. 193. {{ISBN|0807844691}}&lt;/ref&gt; This liberal corporatist ethic was similar to [[Taylorism]] but called for democratization of the capitalism firm.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"/&gt; Liberal corporatists believed that inclusion of all members in the election of management would bring them into the process of management and in effect "reconcile ethics and efficiency, freedom and order, liberty and rationality".&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"/&gt;

Liberal corporatism was an influential component of the [[progressivism in the United States]] that has been referred to as "interest group liberalism".&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 134"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J. ''Corporatism and comparative politics''. M.E. Sharpe, 1996. Pp. 134. {{ISBN|156324716X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support by labour leaders' advocacy of liberal corporatism of the U.S. progressives is believed to have been influenced by an attraction to the [[syndicalism]] and particularly the [[anarcho-syndicalism]] at the time in Europe.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 134"/&gt; In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the [[New Deal]] economic program of the United States in the 1930s as well as in [[Fordism]] and [[Keynesianism]].&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243"&gt;R. J. Barry Jones. ''Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A-F''. Taylor &amp; Frances, 2001. Pp. 243. {{ISBN|0415243521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal corporatism is commonly supported by proponents in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999.

To take land values for public purposes is not really to impose a tax, but to take for public purposes a value created by the community. And out of the fund which would thus accrue from the common property, we might, without degradation to anybody, provide enough to actually secure from want all who were deprived of their natural protectors or met with accident, or any man who should grow so old that he could not work. All prating that is heard from some quarters about its hurting the common people to give them what they do not work for is humbug. The truth is, that anything that injures self-respect, degrades, does harm; but if you give it as a right, as something to which every citizen is entitled to, it does not degrade.

The first newspapers appeared in major port cities such as Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and Charleston in order to provide merchants with the latest trade news. They typically copied any news that was received from other newspapers, or from the London press. The editors discovered they could criticize the local governor and gain a bigger audience; the governor discovered he could shut down the newspapers. The most dramatic confrontation came in New York in 1734, where the governor brought [[John Peter Zenger]] to trial for criminal libel after his paper published some  satirical attacks. Zenger's lawyers argued that truth was a defense against libel and the jury acquitted Zenger, who became the iconic American hero for freedom of the press.  The result was an emerging tension between the media and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Olson, "The Zenger Case Revisited: Satire, Sedition and Political Debate in Eighteenth Century America."

The illiterates often could hear newspapers read aloud at local taverns. By the mid-1760s, there were 24 weekly newspapers in the 13 colonies (only New Jersey was lacking one), and the satirical attack on government became common practice in American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David A.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], already famous as a printer in Philadelphia published one of the first editorial cartoons, ''[[Join, or Die]]'', calling on the colonies to join together to defeat the French. By reprinting news originating in other papers, colonial printers created a private network for evaluating and disseminating news for the whole colonial world. Franklin took the lead, and eventually had two dozen newspapers in his network.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Frasca, "Benjamin Franklin's Printing Network and the Stamp Act," ''Pennsylvania History'' (2004) 71#3 pp. 403-419 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27778636  in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The network played a major role in organizing opposition to the Stamp Act, and in organizing and embolding the Patriots in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;David Copeland,  "'Join, or die': America's press during the French and Indian War."

Colonial newspaper networks played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, starting with their attack on the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2747114 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The newspapers also printed and sold pamphlets, such as the phenomenally successful ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776), which destroyed the king's prestige and jelled Patriot opinion overnight in favor of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop D.

However, the British controlled important cities for varying periods of time, including New York City, 1776 to 1783. They sponsored a Loyalist press that vanished in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, ''American Journalism: A History, 1690-1960'' pp 79-94&lt;/ref&gt;

== New nation, 1780s–1820s==
{{main|First Party System}}
[[File:~party3.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Federalist poster about 1800. Washington (in heaven) tells partisans to keep the pillars of Federalism, Republicanism and Democracy]]
With the formation of the first two political parties in the  1790s, Both parties set up national networks of newspapers to provide a flow of partisan news and information for their supporters.  The newspapers also printed pamphlets, flyers, and ballots that voters could simply drop in the ballot box.

By 1796, both parties had a national network of newspapers, which attacked each other vehemently.  The [[History of American newspapers|Federalist and Republican newspapers]] of the 1790s traded vicious barbs against their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Daniel, ''Scandal and Civility: Journalism and the Birth of
American Democracy'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most heated rhetoric came in debates over the French Revolution, especially the [[Jacobin#The Terror|Jacobin Terror]] of 1793–94 when the guillotine was used daily.  Nationalism was a high priority, and the editors fostered an intellectual nationalism typified by the Federalist effort to stimulate a national literary culture through their clubs and publications in New York and Philadelphia, and through Federalist [[Noah Webster]]'s efforts to simplify and Americanize the language.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine O'Donnell Kaplan, ''Men of Letters in the Early Republic: Cultivating Forms of Citizenship'' 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of political passion came in 1798 as the Federalists in Congress passed the four [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. The fourth Act made it a federal crime to publish "any false, scandalous, or malicious writing or writings against the Government of the United States, with intent to defame... Or to bring them... into contempt or disrepute." Two dozen men were charged with felonies for violating the  Sedition Act, chiefly newspaper editors from the Jeffersonian Republican Party. The act expired in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Berns, "Freedom of the Press and the Alien and Sedition Laws: A Reappraisal," ''Supreme Court Review'' (1970) pp. 109-159
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108724 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Party System: 1830s–1850s==
{{main|History of American newspapers#The press in the Party System: 1820–1890}}
Both parties relied heavily on their national network of newspapers. Some editors were the key political players in their states, and most of them filled their papers with useful information on rallies and speeches and candidates, as well as the text of major speeches and campaign platforms.

== Third Party System: 1850s–1890s==
{{main|Third Party System}}
Newspapers continued their role as the main internal communication system for the Army-style campaigns of the era. The goal was not to convince independents, who are few in number, but to rally all the loyal party members to the polls by making them enthusiastic about the party's platform, and apprehensive about the enemy.

Nearly all weekly and daily papers were party organs until the early 20th century. Thanks to Hoe's invention of high-speed rotary presses for city papers, and free postage for rural sheets, newspapers proliferated. In 1850, the Census counted 1,630 party newspapers (with a circulation of about one per voter), and only 83 "independent" papers. The party line was behind every line of news copy, not to mention the authoritative editorials, which exposed the 'stupidity' of the enemy and the 'triumphs' of the party in every issue. Editors were senior party leaders, and often were rewarded with lucrative postmasterships. Top publishers, such as [[Horace Greeley]], [[Whitelaw Reid]], [[Schuyler Colfax]], [[Warren Harding]] and [[James M. Cox|James Cox]] were nominated on the national ticket. After 1900, [[William Randolph Hearst]], [[Joseph Pulitzer]] and other big city politician-publishers discovered they could make far more profit through advertising, at so many dollars per thousand readers. By becoming non-partisan they expanded their base to include the opposition party and the fast-growing number of consumers who read the ads but were less and less interested in politics. There was less and less political news after 1900, apparently because citizens became more apathetic, and shared their partisan loyalties with the new professional sports teams that attracted larger and larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lee Kaplan, ''Politics and the American press: the rise of objectivity, 1865-1920'' (2002) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. Summers, ''The Press Gang: Newspapers and Politics, 1865-1878'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progressive era==
{{main|Fourth Party System|Muckraker}}
The American Newspaper industry during this era had been massively expanding. The number of English-language newspapers had nearly tripled during this time. Technology had a hand to do with this because of faster printing presses, and more efficient transportation. Newspapers such as the New York World and the New York Journal appealed to a wide variety of audiences with pages devoted to finances, sports, women, entertainment, etc. Special Interest newspapers were also on the rise during this period with many different groups pushing their agenda through newspapers and other forms of media. These special interest newspapers include the National American Woman Suffrage Association's Woman's Journal, The Anti-Saloon League's American Issue, and others. There even came a time that there was up to nine publications in the major cities such as Chicago, Boston, and New York which in turn created fierce competition. Competition caused these publications to lower their prices to just a penny just to stay afloat. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Progressive Era: Primary Documents on Events from 1890 to 1914|last=Burt|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2004|isbn=0313320977|location=West-port,CT|pages=7-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magazines were not a new medium but they became much more popular around 1900, some with circulations in the hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Thanks to the rapid expansion of national advertising, the cover price fell sharply to about 10 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter C. Holloran et al. eds.|title=The A to Z of the Progressive Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt3243E-Wm0C&amp;pg=PA266|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cause was the heavy coverage of corruption in politics, local government and big business, especially by ''Muckrakers.''  They were journalists in the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s-1920s) who wrote for popular magazines to expose social and political sins and shortcomings. They relied on their own  [[investigative journalism]] reporting; muckrakers often worked to expose social ills and corporate and [[Corruption in the United States|political corruption]]. Muckraking magazines–notably ''[[McClure's]]''–took on corporate monopolies and crooked [[political machine]]s while raising public awareness of chronic urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, and [[social issues]] like [[child labor]].  These Journalists were nicknamed muckrakers by Theodore Roosevelt because he complained they were being disruptive by raking up the muck.
&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Shapiro,  ed., ''The muckrakers and American society'' (Heath, 1968), contains representative samples as well as academic commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ray Stannard Baker]], [[George Creel]], and [[Brand Whitlock]] specialized in exposing corruption at the state and local levels. [[Lincoln Steffens]] went after corruption in big cities. [[Ida Tarbell]] attacked John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. Most of the muckrakers wrote nonfiction, but fictional exposes often had a major impact as well, such as those by [[Upton Sinclair]].  He is best known for exposing the corrupt meatpacking industry and the horrific working conditions of men working in these factories and the contamination in the meat.&lt;ref&gt;Judson A. Grenier, "Muckraking the muckrakers: Upton Sinclair and his peers." in  David R Colburn and Sandra Pozzetta, eds., ''Reform and Reformers in the Progressive Era '' (1983) pp: 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Deal era ==
{{main|Fifth Party System|New Deal Coalition}}
Most of the major newspapers in the larger cities were owned by conservative publishers and they turned hostile to liberal President [[Franklin D Roosevelt]] by 1934 or so, including major chains run by [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Roosevelt turned to radio, where he could reach more listeners more directly. During previous election campaigns , the parties sponsored nationwide broadcasts of major speeches. Roosevelt, however, gave intimate talks, person-to-person, as if he were in the same room sitting next to the fireplace. His rhetorical technique was extraordinarily effective. However, it proved very hard to duplicate. Young [[Ronald Reagan]], beginning a career in as a radio broadcaster and Hollywood star, was one of the few to match the right tone, nuance, and intimacy that Roosevelt had introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas B. Craig, ''Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States, 1920-1940'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Fireside-Politics-Political-1920-1940-Reconfiguring-ebook/dp/B007RKNUR6/  excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

In peacetime, [[Freedom of the press]] was not an issue for newspapers. However radio presented the new issue, for the government control the airwaves and licensed them. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] ruled in the "Mayflower decision" in 1941 against the broadcasting of any editorial opinion, although political parties could still purchase airtime for their own speeches and programs. This policy was replaced in 1949 by the "[[Fairness Doctrine]]" which allowed editorials, if opposing views were given equal time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L. Brinson|title=The Red Scare, Politics, and the Federal Communications Commission, 1941-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V02uMPJGX5MC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television era: 1950–1980s ==
Television arrived in the American home in the 1950s, and immediately became the main campaign medium. Party loyalties had weakened and there was a rapid growth in the number of independents. As a result candidates Paid less attention to rallying diehard supporters and instead appealed to independent-minded voters. They adopted television advertising techniques as their primary campaign device. At first the parties paid for long-winded half-hour or hour long speeches. By the 1960s, they discovered that the 30-second or one-minute commercial, repeated over and over again, was the most effective technique. It was expensive, however, so fund-raising became more and more important in winning campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. West, ''Air Wars: Television Advertising and Social Media in Election Campaigns, 1952-2012'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Major technological innovations transformed the mass media. Radio, already overwhelmed by television, transformed itself into a niche service. It developed an important political dimension based on [[Talk radio]]. Television survived with a much reduced audience, but remained the number one advertising medium for election campaigns. Newspapers were in desperate trouble; most afternoon papers closed, and most morning papers barely survived, as the Internet undermined both their advertising and their news reporting.

The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, made use first of the personal computer and the Internet, and after 2010 of the smart phones to connect hundreds of millions of people, especially those under age 35. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message among much larger audiences than they had previously reached.&lt;ref&gt;Juliet E. Carlisle, and Robert C. Patton, "Is Social Media Changing How We Understand Political Engagement?

As political strategists turn their attention to the 2016 presidential contest, they identify Facebook as an increasingly important advertising tool. Recent technical innovations have made possible more advanced divisions and subdivisions of the electorate. Most important, Facebook can now deliver video ads to small, highly targeted subsets. Television, by contrast, shows the same commercials to all viewers, and so cannot be precisely tailored.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Goldmacher, "Facebook the Vote: The social network at the center of American digital life could become the epicenter of the presidential race," [http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/facebook-the-vote-20150612 ''National Journal Magazine'' June 13, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Online presence is vital to the success of a presidential candidate's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globalriskinsights.com/2016/03/how-social-media-is-changing-political-campaigns/|title=How social media is changing political campaigns {{!}} GRI|date=2016-03-11|newspaper=Global Risk Insights|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media presence lets candidates: have direct access to voters, advertise for free, and fundraise, among other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uspolitics.about.com/od/CampaignsElections/tp/How-Social-Media-Has-Changed-Politics.htm|title=Social Media in Politics - Twitter and Facebook as Campaigns Tools|newspaper=About.com News &amp; Issues|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9074">The '''Maysville Road veto''' occurred on May 27, 1830, when United States President [[Andrew Jackson]] vetoed a bill that would allow the federal government to purchase stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Road Company, which had been organized to construct a road linking [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] to [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] on the [[Ohio River]] (Maysville being located approximately 66 miles/106&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Lexington), the entirety of which would be in the state of [[Kentucky]]. Its advocates regarded it as a part of the national [[Cumberland Road]] system. Congress passed a bill in 1830 providing federal funds to complete the project. Jackson vetoed the bill on the grounds that federal funding of intrastate projects of this nature was unconstitutional. He declared that such bills violated the principle that the federal government should not be involved in local economic affairs. Jackson also pointed out that funding for these kinds of projects interfered with paying off the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;Glyndon G. Van Deusen, ''The Jacksonian Era: 1828-1848'' (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1959) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of [[internal improvements]], such as the development of roads and bridges, argued that the federal government had an obligation to harmonize the nation's diverse, and often conflicting, sectional interests into an "[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]." Jackson's decision was heavily influenced by his Secretary of State [[Martin Van Buren]]. Some authors have described the motives behind the veto decision as personal, rather than strictly political. The veto has been attributed to a personal grudge&lt;!-- Jackson's or both? --&gt; against [[Henry Clay]], a political enemy and resident of Kentucky, as well as to preserve the trade monopoly of New York's [[Erie Canal]], in Van Buren's case.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Wiltse, ''The New Nation: 1800-1845'' (1961)  p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate in Congress==
Supporters of the bill insisted on the project's national significance. This particular project was intended to be a part of a much larger interstate system extending from [[Zanesville, Ohio]], to [[Florence, Alabama]]. If the highway as a whole was of national significance, they argued, surely the individual sections must be as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 433-435 (Sen. Tyler). p. 831-833 (Rep. Polk).&lt;/ref&gt; They looked to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision handed down six years before in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', in which the court confirmed the power to regulate commerce among the states including those portions of the journey which lay within one state or another. Additionally, the road connected the interior of Kentucky to the Ohio River, and therefore served as the main artery for the transportation of goods. Kentucky Representative [[Robert Letcher]] made this argument regarding the road's connection to the rest of the nation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The road designed to be improved is intended to intersect at the great national road in the State of Ohio. It connects itself also on each side with the Ohio River. These two connections most certainly and justly entitle it to the appellation of a national work.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.''  p. 820 (Rep. Letcher)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, the federal government had provided funding for other intrastate projects when they benefited the rest of the nation. As Representative Coleman stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But gentlemen say, every inch of the Maysville road is in the State of Kentucky. How can it be national? I answer, every inch of the Delaware Canal, sixteen miles in length, is in the State of [[New Jersey]]; and every inch of the Louisville Canal is in one county; nay, I believe in one city. How can they be national? Yet, Congress have subscribed for stock in both of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 828 (Rep. Coleman)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These arguments were all intended to illustrate the road's overwhelming national significance. Opponents responded that this line of argument would establish that every road was a national road; there would be no limit to federal power.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Debates, 21st Congress, 1st Session.'' p. 831 (Rep. Polk)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jackson's veto==
Jackson believed that federal money should only be spent when carrying out Congress' enumerated powers. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] employed a broad view of the spending power when he carried out the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the construction of the Cumberland Road. In contrast, President [[James Madison]], the "Father of the Constitution”, viewed this type of spending as unconstitutional, as evidenced by his veto of the [[Bonus Bill of 1817]]. Jackson sided with Madison's view and felt that Jefferson's broad view of the spending power was not enough to justify passage of the bill before him.
One of Jackson's main arguments against the bill was the project's provincial nature. It was understood that Congress could only fund projects which benefited the nation as a whole, but the Maysville project was "purely local matter:"

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has no connection with any established system of improvements; is exclusively within the limits of a State, starting at a point on the Ohio River and running out 60 miles to an interior town, and even as far as the State is interested conferring partial instead of general advantages.{{citation needed}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson was quick to clarify that this did not imply that he would approve of projects which were of "national" character. Even though there is not a constitutional argument to be made against this type of action, it would be unwise to do so at the time, given the public debt. Until the debt was paid off, there would be no surplus to spend on these projects.

Generally, Jackson supported internal improvements. During his first term, he sanctioned federal expenditures for transportation projects at a rate nearly double that of the expenditures under President [[John Quincy Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Deusen p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as good policy to spend federal money on national improvements, as long as two conditions were met. First, they should be done pursuant to a general system of improvement, not by ad hoc legislation. Second, the Constitution should be amended to make clear the limits on federal power.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Currie, ''The Constitution in Congress: Democrats and Whigs, 1829-1861'' (U of Chicago Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that Jackson's veto can be seen as largely driven by personal, rather than political motives, particularly given Jackson's approval of internal improvement bills with as much a local nature as the Maysville Road. Jackson's veto may have been one of the many manifestations of the rivalry between Jackson and Henry Clay, who was one of the major proponents of the Maysville Road as part of his [[American System (economic plan)|American System]].

Because the Maysville Road Project was of a local nature, the veto did not encounter resounding opposition in Congress. In fact, the veto would please voters in New York and Pennsylvania who were responsible for financing their own projects, and saw no reason to help fund similar projects in other states. It also appealed to Southern [[states' rights]] supporters who had no need for canals or new roads. For Jackson, this decision underscored his belief that the construction of roads and canals lay more within the realm of the states rather than the federal government. This belief in limiting the federal government's scope of action was to be one of the tenets of [[Jacksonian democracy]].

In 1846 President [[James K. Polk]], an admirer and follower of Jackson, vetoed the [[Rivers and Harbors Bill]] on similar grounds. [[Henry Clay]] and his [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], in contrast to Jackson, supported both the 1830 and 1846 bills because they believed the national government had a responsibility to promote trade commerce and economic modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), 232–37&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Route 68==
While Henry Clay and the Whig Party lost the argument, the two positions represented by the Maysville Road veto continued to face each other into the future. A route that closely approximated the surveyed right-of-way for the Maysville and Lexington Turnpike received substantial federal aid in the 20th century and would be designated as part of [[U.S. Route 68]]. This aid and designation represented a reversal of the principles set forth by Jackson in his 1830 veto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5433">'''Parity of esteem''' is a concept which can be applied in a variety of contexts.

==As a political philosophy==
Parity of esteem can be used to establish a theory to overcome inter-communal conflict. Promoters of the theory argue that ''"parity of esteem"'' "offers a language for negotiation of a post-conflict equilibrium". This negotiation begins with the communities recognising the stalemate of their position. Rather than continue trying to out-do each other, the communities should attempt to negotiate a peaceful coexistence in a shared physical space despite their cultural differences.

''"Parity of esteem"'' can be described as a [[Age of Enlightenment|post-Enlightenment]] theory as it differs drastically from classical [[Liberalism|liberal]] or [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[rationalism]] and is contrary to 20th-century ideas of "[[self-determination]]" or the 19th-century idea of the [[nation-state]]. Many of these anticipated a "withering away of [[nationalism]]" once minorities were brought within the nation-state. These concepts are today the most dominant within contemporary political theory. As [[Ernest Gellner]] writes, "the idea that political boundaries must be congruent with ethnic ones, that rulers must not be ethnically distinguishable from the ruled now has a salience and authority which it has never possessed in the previous history of mankind". Where Enlightenment theories addressed issues of inter-communal conflict, it did so either by promoting "non-sectarianism" against "tribalism" (liberalism) or emphasising "class politics" against "[[bourgeois nationalism]]" (Marxism). Neither of these approaches recognised the traditions of belligerents in inter-communal conflicts. ''"Parity of esteem"'' on the other hand can accepts various nationalist traditions within one state.

Interest in ''"parity of esteem"'' approaches emerged during the mid-1980s and accelerated following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the early 1990s. It was recognised that while there were 184 independent states, there were more than 600 living [[Language family|language groups]] and more than 5,000 [[ethnic groups]]. Simply put, without enough [[Geo-politics|geo-political space]], slogans such as the Serb nationalist claim for "All Serbs in One State" were simply unworkable. Since the end of the 1990s, ''"Parity of esteem"'' is a core concept to the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].

==Health care==
''"Parity of Esteem for Mental Health"'' is an issue for many [[healthcare system]]s because of the pervasive [[Mental disorder#Stigma and discrimination|stigma of mental illness]]. People with diagnosed mental illness die on average around 20 years earlier than those without such a diagnosis, some because of suicide, but mostly because of poorly treated physical illness. Mental illness has been assessed as constituting around a quarter of the [[disease burden]] in developed countries.  There is much bigger [[Global mental health#Treatment gap|treatment gap]] for mental illness than for physical illness.  

In the USA legislation was enacted in 2006 which attempted to achieve equality in health insurance coverage between surgical treatment and mental health treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parity of Esteem for Mental Health|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-485/POST-PN-485.pdf|accessdate=13 September 2015|issue=485|publisher=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the UK [[Norman Lamb]] campaigned for mental health to be given parity of esteem with physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norfolk MP Norman Lamb defeated by Tim Farron in his bid to lead the LiberalD emocrats|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/norfolk_mp_norman_lamb_defeated_by_tim_farron_in_his_bid_to_lead_the_liberal_democrats_1_4156211|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] proposed that parity of esteem should be defined as "Valuing mental health equally with physical health". In practice most arguments have been centred on levels of funding.  Expenditure on mental health services provided by NHS trusts fell by around 8.25% between 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health trust funding down 8% from 2010 despite coalition’s drive for parity of esteem|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/03/20/mental-health-trust-funding-8-since-2010-despite-coalitions-drive-parity-esteem/|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Community Care|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr Phil Moore chair of the Mental Health Commissioners Network at NHS Clinical Commissioners discussions in 2016 had degenerated into a funding dispute.  He wanted to see discussions about the degree to which mental health is embedded into other services, including the integration of psychological services with general practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal||title=\CCG deputy chair urges commissioners to refocus 'parity of esteeem'talks|journal=Commissioning Review|issue=Summer 2016|pages=36-38|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''political faction''' is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a [[political party]], a [[trade union]] or other group, or simply a [[political climate]], united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.

Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.

The Latin word ''factio'' denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognisable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the "team", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.

Occasionally, the term "faction" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but "with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a [[Tory]]) dismissively defined [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as "the name of a faction". Similarly, in the tenth instalment of The Federalist Papers, [[James Madison]] defines a faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." In plain English this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.

==Aims of factions==
The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular [[policy]] or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world.  A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies.  Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “powerbrokers” or “factional chiefs”.

==Organisation==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT change the spelling of "organisation" to "organization". See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English]].--&gt;
Factions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or [[platform (European politics)|platforms]]. Most factions are very loose organisations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, [[whip (politics)|whips]] and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.

==Operation of factions==
In political organisations that are [[democracy|democratic]] in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.

If one faction develops within an organisation, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organisation and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organisation’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.

Key to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way.

A power base serves several key functions:
* It acts as a recruitment centre for new members, and promotes homogeneity within the membership (crucial for maintaining factional cohesion);
* It can be used as an organising centre for factional events and activities;
* It functions as a springboard, advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout.

==Effects of factions==
The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation.  If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.

To avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal [[Feud|vendettas]] where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers.  A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.

Despite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.

In any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.

Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic [[government]] is often invigorated by a strong [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.

The Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.

'''Politics of the International Space Station'''  begins with the 1972 milestone in co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space, the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. This cooperative venture resulted in the July 1975 docking of [[Soyuz 19]] with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]] spacecraft. From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's [[Interkosmos]] programme included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in manned and unmanned missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986 the USSR extended this co-operation to a dozen countries in the [[Mir]] programme. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited MIR in the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]]me. In 1998, assembly of the [[International Space Station]] began.&lt;ref name="OnOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |title=On-Orbit Elements |publisher=NASA |author=NASA |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029013438/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the Canadian Space Agency and those from Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the International Space Station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's Canadarm will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Canada+renews+pledge+International+Space+Station+until+2020/6235789/story.html Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020.] The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply are established by the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). This international treaty was signed on 28 January 1998 by the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="PartStates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration—European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610083738/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|archivedate=10 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level.&lt;ref name="RSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these main intergovernmental agreements, Brazil originally joined the programme as a bilateral partner of the United States by a contract with NASA to supply hardware.&lt;ref name="Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Signs International Space Station Agreement With Brazil|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1996_1998/h97-233.html|date=14 October 1997|accessdate=18 January 2009|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to its ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS programme.

The heads of both the South Korean and Indian space agency [[ISRO]] announced at the first plenary session of the 2009 [[International Astronautical Congress]] that their nations wished to join the ISS programme, with talks due to begin in 2010. The heads of agency also expressed support for extending ISS lifetime.&lt;ref name="ISRO and KARI to join ISS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/10/14/333406/south-korea-india-to-begin-iss-partnership-talks-in.html|title=South Korea, India to begin ISS partnership talks in 2010|work=Flight International|accessdate=14 October 2009|date=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; European countries not part of the programme will be allowed access to the station in a three-year trial period, [[ESA]] officials say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/EU_mulls_opening_ISS_to_more_countries_999.html|title=EU mulls opening ISS to more countries|publisher=Space-travel.com|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian part of the station is operated and controlled by the Russian Federation's space agency and provides Russia with the right to nearly one-half of the crew time for the ISS. The allocation of remaining crew time (three to four crew members of the total permanent crew of six) and hardware within the other sections of the station is as follows: ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'': 51% for the ESA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; ''[[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibō]]'': 51% for the JAXA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_japan.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=24 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]'': 97.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_csa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Canadian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crew time, electrical power and rights to purchase supporting services (such as data upload and download and communications) are divided 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSSM"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American observers comment that Shenzhou spacecraft could dock at the ISS if it became politically feasible, whilst Chinese engineers say work would still be required on the rendezvous system.

The '''raised fist''', or the '''clenched fist''', is a [[symbol]] of [[Social solidarity|solidarity]] and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/22/every-movement-needs-a-symbol-enter-the-wisconsin-fist-of-solidarity/ |title=Every Movement Needs a Symbol: Enter The Wisconsin Fist of Solidarity |first=Megan |last=Gibson |publisher=Time |date=February 22, 2011 }}{{rs|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a [[salute]] to express unity, strength, defiance, or [[Resistance movement|resistance]].

The gesture of the raised fist, so widespread among left-wing workers' groups, gave rise to more regimented variations, such as the salute with the fist on one's temple, characteristic of the German  ''[[Rotfrontkämpferbund|Rotfront]]'', which was adopted by the republican Popular Army. }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A raised fist was used as a [[logo]] by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L. Kornbluh, Solidarity, 1917; Rebel Voices: An IWW Anthology, Charles H. Kerr Publishing, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (IWW) in 1917. However, it was popularised during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939, when it was used by the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] as a greeting, and was known as the "[[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] salute" or the "[[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute". The salute subsequently spread among leftists and anti-fascists across Europe.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17739105 |title=Breivik: What's behind clenched-fist salutes? |last=Kelly |first=Jon |date=17 April 2012 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic symbol was popularised in 1948 by [[Taller de Gráfica Popular]], a print shop in [[Mexico]] that used art to advance revolutionary social causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Bancroft/BANC_PIC_2001_206.html|title=Mexican posters on social and educational themes|work=docspopuli.org|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use spread through the United States in the 1960s after artist and activist [[Frank Cieciorka]] produced a simplified version for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]: this version was subsequently used by [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and the [[Black Power movement]].&lt;ref name=aiga&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aiga.org/not-your-grandparent-s-clenched-fist |title=Not Your Grandparent’s Clenched Fist |last=Patton |first=Phil |date=10 January 2006 |website=[[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raised fist was frequently used in propaganda posters produced during the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 revolt in France]], such as ''La Lutte continue'', depicting a factory chimney topped with a clenched fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rfi.fr/20180404-culture-france-may-68-posters-show-where-they-were-made-beaux-arts-paris |title=France May 68: the art of revolution |last=Hird |first=Alison |date=4 April 2018 |website=[[rfi.fr]] |access-date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Considine |first1=Liam |date=Autumn 2015 |title=Screen Politics: Pop Art and the Atelier Populaire |url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/24/screen-politics-pop-art-and-the-atelier-populaire |journal=Tate Papers |issn=1753-9854 |issue=24 |access-date=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/arts/design/may-1968-paris.html |title=Printing a Revolution: The Posters of Paris ’68 |last=Rubin |first=Alissa J. |author-link=Alissa J.

The symbol has been picked up and incorporated around the world by various [[oppression|oppressed]] groups. In 2015 it has emerged in the southeast area of Ukraine among the [[separatists]] battling the Ukraine Kiev government forces, along with the phrase "¡No Pasarán!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Senesi |first=Vauro |date=19 January 2015 |title=Viaggio in Ucraina: al fronte di Lugansk con i ribelli filorussi.

The image gallery shows how a raised fist is used in [[visual communication]]. Combined with another [[graphic design|graphic element]], a raised fist is used to convey [[polysemous]] [[gesture]]s and opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hat4PMRx7lUC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=raised%20fist&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=raised%20fist&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Meaning in Gesture|first=Geneviève|last=Calbris|date=1 January 2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|accessdate=16 January 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the elements combined, the meaning of the gesture changes in [[Tone (literature)|tone]] and [[intention]]. For example, a [[hammer and sickle]] combined with a raised fist is part of [[communist symbolism]], while the same fist combined with a [[Venus symbol]] represents [[Feminism]], and combined with a [[book]], it represents [[librarian]]s.

A raised-fist icon appears prominently as a feminist symbol on the covers of two major books by [[Robin Morgan]], ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'', published in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinmorgan.us/robin_morgan_bookDetails.asp?ProductID=9 Author's website], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sisterhood Is Forever'', in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinmorgan.us/robin_morgan_bookDetails.asp?ProductID=7 Author's website], as accessed September 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol had been popularised in the feminist movement during the [[Miss America protest]] in 1968 which Morgan co-organised.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The raised fist logo may represent unity or solidarity, generally with oppressed peoples. The black fist, also known as the [[Black Power]] fist is a logo generally associated with [[black nationalism]] and sometimes [[socialism]]. Its most widely known usage is by the [[Black Panther Party]] in the 1960s. A black fist logo was also adopted by the [[northern soul]] music [[subculture]]. The white fist, also known as the Aryan fist or the [[White Supremacy|White Power]] fist is a logo generally associated with [[white nationalism]].

A white fist holding a red rose is used by the [[Socialist International]] and some socialist or [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties, such as the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party in France]] and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

[[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] occasionally use a red clenched fist on [[Northern Irish murals|murals]] depicting the [[Red Hand of Ulster]]. However, this is considered rare; the red hand is usually depicted with a flat palm.

[[Irish Republicans]] often have the raised fist as a symbol of resistance against British rule.

The Gonzo fist emblem is characterized by two thumbs and four fingers holding a [[peyote]] button, was originally used in [[Hunter S. Thompson|Hunter S. Thompson's]] 1970 campaign for sheriff of [[Aspen, Colorado]]. It has become a symbol of Thompson and [[gonzo journalism]] as a whole.

The [[Unicode]] character for the raised fist is {{unichar|270A}}.

The raised fist salute consists of raising one arm in the air with a clenched fist. The meaning can vary based on context.

[[Image:Raised Fist at antiwar demo.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]]: A woman raises her fist in solidarity with protestors opposing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].]]

Different movements sometimes use different terms to describe the raised fist salute: amongst communists and socialists, it is sometimes called the red salute, whereas amongst some African-American activists, especially in the United States it has been called the [[Black Power]] salute. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], it was sometimes known as the [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute.

The clenched fist gesture is sometimes thought to have originated in the [[Spanish Civil War]], where the Popular Front salute was at one time the standard salute of Republican forces. A letter from the Spanish Civil War stated: "...the raised fist which greets you in Salud is not just a gesture—it means life and liberty being fought for and a greeting of solidarity with the democratic peoples of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Mary. Letter to Leo Hurwitz and Janey Dudley, 25 November 1938. Reprinted in Cary Nelson and Jefferson Hendricks, eds. "Madrid 1937: Letters of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade from the Spanish Civil War," Routledge: 1996. Reprinted online [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/scw/letters.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rotfrontkämpferbund]] [[paramilitary]] organization of [[Communist Party of Germany]] used the salute before [[World War II]] as a probable counter-gesture to the fascist salute.&lt;ref&gt;Korff, Gottfried: "Symbolgeschichte als Sozialgeschichte? Zehn vorläufige Notizen zu den Bild- und Zeichensystemen sozialer Bewegungen in Deutschland", in: Warneken, Bernd Jürgen (Hg.): "Massenmedium Strasse. Zur Kulturgeschichte der Demonstrationen." Frakfurt/Main 1991. S. 27–28. Cited in: Schulte-Rummel, Sven "Die politische Symbolik der Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands in der Weimarer Republlik" [http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/vorschau/95026.html].
"Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Symbolen der Kommunisten beginnt die Geschichte der geballten Faust in der Ära der Weimarer Republik. Sie war prägendes Symbol bei Straßenaufmärschen, Spiegel der gewaltbereiten Demonstranten, die voller Frust über das System dem Staat die geballte Faust zeigten." Translation: "Unlikely the most of other Communists symbols, the history of Raised fist started in the era of Weimar Republic. It was a definitive symbol of street marches, reflection of the marchers who were ready for violence, who were disappointed by the whole system of the state and showed their clenched fists to it."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], medal winners [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|gave the raised fist salute]] during the American [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] as a sign of black power, and as a protest on behalf of the Olympic Project for Human Rights. For this, they were banned from further Olympic activities. The event was one of the most overtly political statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html | publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] | last=Lewis | first=Richard | date=2006-10-08 | title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]]. Tommie Smith stated in his autobiography, "Silent Gesture", that the salute was not a Black Power salute, but in fact a [[human rights]] salute.

[[Nelson Mandela]] also used the clenched fist salute upon his release from [[Victor Verster Prison]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

A raised White fist is also a popular [[White nationalism#White power|White Power]] symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/raised-fist-salute-has-varied-meanings/ |title=Raised-Fist Salute Has Varied Meanings |first=J. David |last=Goodman |date=April 16, 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian right-wing terrorist [[Anders Behring Breivik]] made a clenched-fist salute upon his conviction. Similarly [[Carlos the Jackal]] used the gesture in court, and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] raised his fist to photographers after his arrest for the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The raised fist is used by officials in Mainland China when being sworn into office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/premier/news/2016/09/18/content_281475445040096.htm|title=State Council holds first swearing-in ceremony to uphold Constitution|work=english.gov.cn|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] has suggested that the appeal of the salute is that it allows the individual to indicate that they "intend to meet malevolent, massive institutional force with force of (their) own", and that they are bound in struggle with others against common oppression.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Real freedom''' is a term coined by the [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] and [[economist]] [[Philippe Van Parijs]]. It expands upon notions of [[negative freedom]] by incorporating not simply institutional or other constraints on a person's choices, but also the requirements of physical reality, resources and personal capacity. To have real freedom, according to Van Parjis, an individual must:

:1. not be prevented from acting on their will (i.e. they must have traditional negative freedom)
:2. possess the resources or capacities actually to carry out their will.

Under this conception, a [[moral agent]] could be ''negatively'' free to take a holiday in [[Miami]], because no-one is forcing them not to (condition 1 is met); but not ''really'' free to do so, because they cannot afford the flight (condition 2 is not met). Similarly, someone could be negatively free to swim across the [[English Channel]]; but not really free, because they are not a good enough swimmer and would not be able to succeed in the task. Real freedom is, then, a matter of ''degree'' — one is more or less really free, not just either really free or not; and no-one has ''complete'' real freedom — no-one is currently really free to [[Teleportation|teleport]] to [[Mars]], for instance.

Real freedom expands on negative freedom by adding the idea of actually being able to exercise a capacity or resource in the absence of constraint; but does not go as far as some ideas of positive freedom, by refraining from appeal to self-government by a real, best, or higher self.

Van Parijs uses the concept of real freedom as part of his influential argument for a [[universal basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philippe |last=Van Parijs |title=Real Freedom For All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism? |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Income Tax Germany 2010.png|thumb|German [[progressive tax]] rates for different incomes. Progressive tax systems require the rich to pay taxes at higher rates, to make it possible to raise larger total sums to pay for governmental functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Investopedia|title=The Advantages of a Progressive Tax|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue such systems are primarily for wealth redistribution.]]

'''Redistribution of income''' and '''redistribution of wealth''' are respectively the transfer of [[income]] and of [[wealth]] (including physical [[property]]) from some [[individual]]s to others by means of a social mechanism such as [[taxation]], [[charity (practice)|charity]], [[welfare]], [[public services]], [[land reform]], [[monetary policies]], [[confiscation]], [[divorce]] or [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/redistribution/ |title=Redistribution |date=2 July 2004 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |publisher=Stanford University |quote=The ''social mechanism'', such as a change in tax laws, monetary policies, or tort law, that engenders the redistribution of goods among these subjects|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically refers to redistribution on an economy-wide basis rather than between selected individuals.

Interpretations of the phrase vary, depending on personal perspectives, political ideologies and the selective use of statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker: Elizabeth Warren’s claim that the bottom 90 percent got ‘zero percent’ of wage growth after Reagan.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/23/elizabeth-warrens-claim-that-the-bottom-90-percent-got-zero-percent-of-wage-growth-after-reagan/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is frequently heard in politics, usually referring to perceived redistributions from those who have more to those who have less.  Occasionally, however, it is used to describe laws or policies that cause opposite redistributions that shift monetary burdens from wealthy to low-income individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Robert|title=Trump’s Stock in Trade is Cruelty. Count the ways.|url=http://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trumps-stock-trade-cruelty-count-ways-594472|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase can be emotionally charged and used to exaggerate or misconstrue the motivations of opponents during political debates.  For example, if an individual politician calls for increased taxes on higher income individuals, their sole focus may be to raise funds for specific government programs, tapping the largest available sources while realizing that low-wage workers have little or no excess income to draw tax revenues from. Political opponents might argue that this politician's prime motivation is to redistribute wealth, when redistribution is not their goal.

The phrase is often coupled with the term "[[Class conflict|class warfare]]," with high income earners and the wealthy portrayed as victims of unfairness and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FAIR|title=For Media, ‘Class War’ Has Wealthy Victims, Rich getting richer seldom labeled as belligerents.|url=http://fair.org/extra/for-media-class-war-has-wealthy-victims/|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redistribution tax policy should not be confused with [[predistribution]] policies.  "Predistribution" is the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities occurring in the first place rather than through the tax and benefits system once they have occurred.  For example, a government predistribution policy might require employers to pay all employees a [[living wage]], not just a [[minimum wage]], as a "bottom-up" response to widespread income inequalities or high poverty rates.

Many alternate taxation proposals have been floated without the political will to alter the status quo. One example is the proposed "[[Buffett Rule]]", which is a hybrid taxation model composed of opposing systems, intended to minimize the favoritism of the special interest tax design.

The effects of a redistribution system are actively debated on ethical and economic grounds. The subject includes analysis of its rationales, objectives, means, and policy effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Cowell ([1987] 2008).  "redistribution of income and wealth," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000067&amp;edition=current&amp;q= TOC.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=January 27, 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 survey among 264 members of the [[American Economic Association]] found that 71.2% of them support redistribution, while 20.4% oppose it, and 7.2% had mixed feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Stern|first2=Charlotta|title=Economists’ policy views and voting|journal=Public Choice|date=2006|volume=126|issue=3-4|page=337|doi=10.1007/s11127-006-7509-6|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/klein/PdfPapers/KS_PublCh06.pdf|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient times, redistribution operated as a [[palace economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lukas|last=de Blois |author2=R.J. van der Spek |translator=Susan Mellor |title=An Introduction to the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|pages=56–60|isbn=0-415-12773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These economies were centrally based around the administration, so the dictator or pharaoh had both the ability and the right to say who was taxed and who got special treatment.

Another early form of wealth redistribution occurred in [[Plymouth Colony]] under the leadership of [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]].&lt;ref name=commoncourse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/william-bradford|title=William Bradford – Facts &amp; Summary |publisher=History.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradford records in his diary that this "common course"&lt;ref name=commoncourse /&gt; bred confusion, discontent, distrust, and the colonists looked upon it as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tYecOAN1cwwC&amp;pg=PA135 ''History of Plymouth Plantation''], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term [[Distributism]] (also known as distributionism or distributivism) is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of [[Catholic social teaching]], especially the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his encyclical ''Rerum novarum'' and [[Pope Pius XI]] in ''Quadragesimo anno''.  More recently, [[Pope Francis]] in his ''Evangelii Gaudium'', echoed the earlier Papal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt III|first1=Arthur W.|title=Pope Francis Needs Distributism: Americans and popes alike can embrace a humane alternative to modern capitalism.|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/pope-francis-needs-distributism/|publisher=The American Conservative|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in economic systems ==
Different types of [[economic system]]s feature varying degrees of interventionism aimed at redistributing income, depending on how unequal their initial distributions of income are. Free-market [[capitalist]] economies tend to feature high degrees of income redistribution. However, Japan's government engages in much less redistribution because its initial wage distribution is much more equal than Western economies. Likewise, the [[socialist]] planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc featured very little income redistribution because private [[Property income|capital and land income]] – the major drivers of income inequality in capitalist systems – was virtually nonexistent; and because the wage rates were set by the government in these economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 11|quote=Economies vary based on the extent to which and the methods by which governments intervene to redistribute income. This depends partly on how unequal income is to begin with before any redistributive policies are implemented. Thus the Japanese government does much less redistributing than the governments of many other capitalist countries because Japan has a more equal distribution of wages than most other capitalist countries. Command socialist economies also have had less income redistribution because governments initially control the distribution of income by setting wages and forbidding capital or land income.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern forms of redistribution ==
Today, income redistribution occurs in some form in most [[Democracy|democratic]] countries through economic policies. Some redistributive policies attempt to take wealth, income, and other resources from the “haves” and give them to the “have-nots,” but many redistributions go elsewhere.

In his article ''Redistribution'',&lt;ref name="Redistribution"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Dwight R.|title=Redistribution|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight R. Lee states:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
“…most government transfers are not from the rich to the poor. Instead, government takes from the relatively unorganized (e.g., consumers and general taxpayers) and gives to the relatively organized (groups politically organized around common interests, such as the elderly, sugar farmers, and steel producers). The most important factor in determining the pattern of redistribution appears to be political influence, not poverty. “

“The direct transfer of cash and services is only one way that government transfers income. Another way is by restricting competition among producers. The inevitable consequence—indeed, the intended consequence—of these restrictions is to enrich organized groups of producers at the expense of consumers. Here, the transfers are more perverse than with Medicare and Social Security. They help relatively wealthy producers at the expense of relatively poor (and, in some cases, absolutely poor) consumers. Many government restrictions on agricultural production, for example, allow farmers to capture billions of consumer dollars through higher food prices (see [[agricultural subsidy]] programs). Most of these dollars go to relatively few large farms, whose owners are far wealthier than the average taxpayer and consumer (or the average farmer). Also, wealthy farmers receive most of the government’s direct agricultural subsidies."

|}

Some consider the U.S. government’s progressive-rate [[income tax]] policy as redistributive, because some of the tax revenue goes to social programs such as welfare and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Christine, and Gerald C. Wright. ''Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics.'' 7th ed.: CQ, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] system, a high income earner will pay a higher tax rate (a larger percentage of their income) than a low income earner; and therefore, will pay more total dollars per person.&lt;ref&gt;Prante, Gerald, and Scott A. Hodge. "The Distribution of Tax and Spending Policies in the United States." Tax Foundation. N.p., 13 Nov. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other taxation-based methods of redistributing income are the [[negative income tax]] for very low income earners and [[tax loopholes]] (tax avoidance) for the better-off.

Two other common types of governmental redistribution of income are [[subsidies]] and [[vouchers]] (such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]). These [[transfer payment]] programs are funded through general taxation, but benefit the poor or influential special interest groups and corporations.&lt;ref name="Redistribution"/&gt; While the persons receiving transfers from such programs may prefer to be directly given cash, these programs may be more palatable to society than cash assistance, as they give society some measure of control over how the funds are spent.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey S. Rosen &amp; Ted Gayer, Public Finance pp. 271–72 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the U.S. [[Social security|Social Security]] program redistributes income from the rich to the poor,  but the majority of those receiving Social Security earned their benefits through tax withholding from their paychecks or quarterly income statements, and most benefits are indexed to the actual earning levels of individual workers.  Only the highest- and lowest-income workers fall outside normal rates.  In addition, Social Security deductions are only taken from the first $200,000 in income, with nothing further taken from higher incomes over that amount. In other words, a person who earns $100 million a year pays the same Social Security tax as another worker who earns $200,000 a year.

Contrary to popular belief, a recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balls|first1=Andrew|title=Social Security Does Not Redistribute Income|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html#navDiv=6|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, overall, the Social Security System was slightly regressive against the poor and not redistributive, once important factors were taken into account (for example, the longer life expectancy of the wealthy when compared to the poor gives them more years to collect benefits).

Governmental redistribution of income may include a direct benefit program involving either cash transfers or the purchase of specific services for an individual. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Rector, Robert. "The Redistributive State: The Allocation of Government Benefits, Services, and Taxes in the United States." The Heritage Foundation. N.p., 15 Sept. 2015. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare is a government-run health insurance program that covers people age 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with [[end-stage renal disease]] (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD). This is a direct benefit program because the government is directly providing health insurance for those who qualify.

The difference between the [[Gini index]] for the [[income distribution]] before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Wealth redistribution can be implemented through [[land reform]] that transfers ownership of land from one category of people to another, or through [[inheritance tax]]es or direct [[wealth tax]]es. Before-and-after Gini coefficients for the [[distribution of wealth]] can be compared.

==Objectives==
The objectives of income redistribution are to increase economic stability and opportunity for the less wealthy members of society and thus usually include the funding of [[public services]].

One basis for redistribution is the concept of [[distributive justice]], whose premise is that money and resources ought to be distributed in such a way as to lead to a [[socially just]], and possibly more financially [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], society. Another argument is that a larger [[middle class]] benefits an economy by enabling more people to be [[consumer]]s, while providing equal opportunities for individuals to reach a better standard of living. Seen for example in the work of [[John Rawls]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} another argument is that a truly fair society would be organized in a manner benefiting the least advantaged, and any inequality would be permissible only to the extent that it benefits the least advantaged.

Some proponents of redistribution argue that [[capitalism]] results in an [[externality]] that creates unequal wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. A. ,''Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=December 2011}} argue that wealth and income inequality are a cause of [[economic crises]], and that reducing these inequalities is one way to prevent or ameliorate economic crises, with redistribution thus benefiting the economy overall. This view was associated with the [[underconsumptionism]] school in the 19th century, now considered an aspect of some schools of [[Keynesian economics]]; it has also been advanced, for different reasons, by [[Marxian economics]]. It was particularly advanced in the US in the 1920s by [[Waddill Catchings]] and [[William Trufant Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dorfman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title= Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics.

There is currently a great debate concerning the extent to which the world's extremely rich have become richer over recent decades. Thomas Piketty's ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' is at the forefront, critiqued in certain publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Forget the 1%; Free Exchange", ''The Economist'', 8 November 2014, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral obligation ===
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
[[Peter Singer]]'s argument contrasts to Thomas Pogge's in that he states we have an individual moral obligation to help the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.net/singer/by/1972----.htm|title=Famine, Affluence, and Morality, by Peter Singer|first=Pablo|last=Stafforini|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/fighting-poverty|title=Fighting Poverty|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, British researchers [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]] show a correlation between income inequality and higher rates of health and social problems ([[obesity]], [[mental illness]], [[homicide]]s, [[teenage birth]]s, [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration]], child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods ([[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy]], educational performance, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust among strangers]], [[Women's rights#2011 study of status by country|women's status]], [[social mobility]], even numbers of [[patent]]s issued per capita), on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resources/slides|title=The Spirit Level - The Equality Trust|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue inequality leads to the social ills through the psychosocial [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], [[Social status|status]] anxiety it creates.&lt;ref name=thinktanks&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/14/the-spirit-level-equality-thinktanks "The Spirit Level: how 'ideas wreckers' turned book into political punchbag"], Robert Booth, ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[International Monetary Fund]] by Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry found a strong association between lower levels of inequality and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries (such as Brazil, Cameroon, Jordan) with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf "Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin?"] Andrew G.

==Criticism==
[[Public choice]] theory states that redistribution tends to benefit those with political clout to set spending priorities more than those in need, who lack real influence on government.&lt;ref&gt;Plotnick, Robert (1986) "An Interest Group Model of Direct Income Redistribution", ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', vol. 68, no. 4, pp. 594–602.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] criticize redistribution via taxation in the context of [[Nordic model|Nordic-style]] [[social democracy]], highlighting its limited success at promoting relative egalitarianism and its lack of sustainability. They point out that social democracy requires a strong labor movement to sustain its heavy redistribution, and that it is unrealistic to expect such redistribution to be feasible in countries with weaker labor movements. They point out that, even in the Scandinavian countries, social democracy has been in decline since the labor movement weakened. Instead, Roemer and Bardhan argue that changing the patterns of enterprise ownership and [[market socialism]], obviating the need for redistribution, would be more sustainable and effective at promoting egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation", by Pranab Bardhan and Johen E. Roemer. 1992. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', vol. 6, no. 3, p. 104: "Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] argue that social democratic reforms – including policies to redistribute income – such as unemployment benefits and high taxes on profits and the wealthy create more contradictions in capitalism by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system via reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism 1998. P.60-61"&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. pp. 60–61: "The Marxist answers that...it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the [[reserve army of labour]], taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion)."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Marxist view, redistribution cannot resolve the fundamental issues of capitalism – only a transition to a socialist economy can.

'''Reform''' ({{lang-lat|reformo}}) means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc.&lt;ref&gt;dictionary definition http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reform?s=t&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from [[Christopher Wyvill#The Yorkshire Association|Christopher Wyvill’s Association movement]] which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim.&lt;ref&gt;Reform in English Public Life: the fortunes of a word. Joanna Innes 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform is generally distinguished from [[revolution]]. The latter means basic or radical change; whereas reform may be no more than fine tuning, or at most redressing serious wrongs without altering the fundamentals of the system.  Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it wholesale. Radicals on the other hand, seek to improve the system, but try to overthrow whether it be the government or a group of people themselves.

[[Rotation in office]] or [[term limits]] would, by contrast, be more revolutionary, in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.&lt;ref&gt;On term limits reform see, [http://www.ustl.org/index.html U.S. Term Limits].  On more radical/revolutionary changes, including term limits, see, for example, Robert Struble, Jr., [http://www.tell-usa.org  ''Treatise on Twelve Lights: To Restore America the Beautiful under God and the Written Constitution''], 2007-08 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Developing countries]] may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from [[international financial institutions]] and [[aid agencies]]. This can include reforms to [[macroeconomic policy]], the [[civil service reform in developing countries|civil service]], and [[Public finance|public financial management]].

[[Reform (Religion)|Religious Reforms]] are performed in religions and churches.

==Re-form==
A note about [[spelling]]: when used to describe something which is ''physically'' formed again, such as re-[[casting]] it in a [[molding (process)|mold/mould]], or a [[band (music)|band]] that gets back together, the proper term is ''re-form'' (with a [[hyphen]]), not "reform".

As a philosophy, secularism seeks to interpret life on principles taken solely from the material world, without recourse to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Livingstone |first1=E.A. |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191727214 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198614425.001.0001/acref-9780198614425}}&lt;/ref&gt; In political terms, secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]] and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]] (the attainment of such is termed [[secularity]]). Under a brief definition, Secularism means that governments should remain neutral on the matter of religion and should not enforce nor prohibit the free exercise of religion, leaving religious choice to the [[liberty]] of the people.  One manifestation of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, or, in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief, from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;See also [[Separation of church and state]] and ''[[Laïcité]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another manifestation of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions, especially [[Politics|political]] ones, should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;"Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives".

Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;See also [[Public reason]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as [[Zeno of Citium]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]; from [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[John Locke]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Voltaire]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Thomas Paine]]; and from more recent [[Freethought|freethinkers]] and [[Atheism|atheists]] such as [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Christopher Hitchens]]. It shifts the focus from religion to other ‘temporal’ and ‘this-worldly’ things with emphasis on nature, reason, science, and development.&lt;ref&gt;Yaniv Roznai citing Domenic Marbaniang in "Negotiating the Eternal: The Paradox of Entrenching Secularism in Constitutions," ''Michigan State Law Review'' 253, 2017, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of secularism, on a social or philosophical level, has often occurred while maintaining an official [[state church]] or other state support of religion. In the [[United States]], some argue that [[#State secularism|state secularism]] has served to a greater extent to protect religion and the religious from governmental interference, while secularism on a social level is less prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Yavuz, Hakan M. and John L.

On the other hand, [[Meiji era]] Japan maintained that it was secular and allowed [[freedom of religion]] despite enforcing [[State Shinto]] and continuing to prohibit certain "superstitions;" scholar of religion Jason Ānanda Josephson has labelled this conception of the secular "the Shinto Secular" and noted that it follows a pattern established in certain European constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Jason Ānanda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=132-139, 186-91|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holyoake2.JPG|thumb|The [[British people|British]] writer [[George Jacob Holyoake]] (1817–1906) coined the term "secularism" in 1851&lt;ref name="Holyoake" &gt;{{cite book |last=Holyoake |first=G.J. |authorlink=George Holyoake |year=1896 |title=English Secularism: A Confession of Belief |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCg0dcD2bBAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DCg0dcD2bBAC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Mr.+Holyoake%22%22will+lay+before+the+meeting+%5Bthen+proposed%5D+the+present+position+of+Secularism+in+the+provinces.%22%22(Reasoner,+Dec.+10,+1851,+p.+62.)%22%22This+was+the+first+time+the+word%22%22Secularism%22%22appeared+in+the+press%22 47−48] |publisher=Library of Alexandria |id={{ISBN|1-46551332-9}} |isbn=978-1-465-51332-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|right|[[Italians|Italian]] law professor [[Alberico Gentili]] (1552–1608) first split secularism from [[canon law]] and [[Roman Catholic theology]].]]
The term "secularism" was first used by the [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[George Jacob Holyoake]] in 1851.&lt;ref name="Holyoake" /&gt; Holyoake invented the term secularism to describe his views of promoting a social order separate from religion, without actively dismissing or criticizing religious belief. An [[agnostic]] himself, Holyoake argued that "Secularism is not an argument against Christianity, it is one independent of it. It does not question the pretensions of Christianity; it advances others. Secularism does not say there is no light or guidance elsewhere, but maintains that there is light and guidance in secular truth, whose conditions and sanctions exist independently, and act forever. Secular knowledge is manifestly that kind of knowledge which is founded in this life, which relates to the conduct of this life, conduces to the welfare of this life, and is capable of being tested by the experience of this life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Holyoake | first=G.J. | title=The Reasoner | publisher=Holyoake. | issue=v. 30 | year=1872 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cA7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA100 | access-date=2017-10-04 | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Kosmin]] of the [[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture]] breaks modern secularism into two types: hard and soft secularism.  According to Kosmin, "the hard secularist considers religious propositions to be [[epistemological]]ly illegitimate, warranted by neither reason nor experience."  However, in the view of soft secularism, "the attainment of absolute truth was impossible and therefore skepticism and tolerance should be the principle and overriding values in the discussion of science and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/9614BC42-9E4C-42BF-A7F4-0B5EE1009462/0/Kosmin_paper.pdf |title=Kosmin, Barry A.

==History==
The departure from reliance on religious faith to reason and science marks the beginning of the secularization of education and society in history. Among the earliest documentations of a secular form of thought is seen in the [[Charvaka]] system of philosophy, which held [[direct perception]], [[empiricism]], and conditional [[inference]] as proper sources of knowledge, and sought to reject the prevailing religious practices of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govind-pansare-mm-kalburgi-gauri-lankesh-murder-5316465/|title=Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar|date=2018-08-21|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Domenic Marbaniang, Secularism emerged in the West with the establishment of reason over religious faith as human reason was gradually liberated from unquestioned subjection to the dominion of religion and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Budiselić, "Christian Witness for the 21st Century: Contemporary, yet Orthodox and Radical," ''Bogoslovni vestnik,'' 74 University of Ljlubljana, (2014) 3, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Secularism first appeared in the West in the classical philosophy and politics of ancient Greece, disappeared for a time after the fall of Greece, but resurfaced after a millennium and half in the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]]. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An increasing confidence in human capabilities, reason, and progress, that emerged during the Italian Renaissance, together with an increasing distrust in organized and state supported religion during the Reformation, was responsible for the ushering of modernity during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which brought all facets of human life including religion under the purview of reason and thus became responsible for the freeing of education, society, and state from the domination of religion; in other words, the development of modern secularism.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, ''Secularism in India: A Historical Analysis'' SI: Domenic Marbaniang, 2011, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Harvey Cox explains that the Enlightenment hailed Nature as the "deep reality" that transcended the corrupted man-made institutions of men. Consequently, the rights of man were not considered as God-given but as the de facto benefits of Nature as revealed by Reason.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Cox, ''The Secular City: Secularization and Urbanization in Theological Perspective'' (Princeton University Press, 2013), p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In political terms, secularism is a movement towards the separation of religion and government (often termed the [[separation of church and state]]).  This can refer to reducing ties between a government and a [[state religion]], replacing laws based on scripture (such as [[Halakha]], [[Dominionism]], and [[Sharia]] law) with civil laws, and eliminating discrimination on the basis of religion.  This is said to add to democracy by protecting the rights of religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). p. 14. "[Legal secularists] claim that separating religion from the public, governmental sphere is necessary to ensure the full inclusion of all citizens."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''On Temporal Authority (1523),'' [[Martin Luther]] argued for the division of the church and the state. He specified two distinct powers: ''weltliches Regiment'' (German word for ‘the kingdom of the world,’ ‘the State’) and ''geistliches Regiment'' (German word for ‘the kingdom of God,’ ‘the Church’) and argued that citizens need only subject to the ruler's edict as long as the edict conformed to God's divine will as revealed in the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Kingdom in Secular Politics" in ''Basileia: A Theological Journal'', Itarsi: Central India Theological Seminary, Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars, such as [[Jacques Berlinerblau]] of the Program for Jewish Civilization at the [[School of Foreign Service|Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]], have argued that the separation of church and state is but one possible strategy to be deployed by secular governments. What all secular governments, from the democratic to the authoritarian, share is a concern about the relationship between the church and the state. Each secular government may find its own unique policy prescriptions for dealing with that concern (separation being one of those possible policies; French models, in which the state carefully monitors and regulates the church, being another).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Berlinerblau|Berlinerblau, Jacques]], "How to be Secular," Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major impact on the idea of state religious liberty came from the writings of [[John Locke]] who, in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration]] argued in favor of religious toleration. He argued that government must treat all citizens and all religions equally and that it can restrict actions but not the religious intent behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Elissa B. Alzate, ''Religious Liberty in a Lockean Society'', Palgrave Studies in Religion, Politics, and Policy, 2017, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maharaja Ranjeet Singh]] of the [[Sikh empire]] of the first half of the 19th century successfully established a [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. This secular rule respected members of all races and religions and it allowed them to participate without discrimination in Ranjeet Singh's [[Durbar (court)|darbar]] and he had Sikh, Muslim and Hindu representatives heading the darbar.&lt;ref&gt;K.S. Duggal, ''Ranjit Singh: A Secular Sikh Sovereign'', Abhinav Publications (1989) {{ISBN|81-7017-244-6}}''&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh also extensively funded education, religion, and arts of various different religions and languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheikh|first=Majid|title=Destruction of schools as Leitner saw them|url=http://dawn.com/2010/10/31/destruction-of-schools-as-leitner-saw-them/|work=Dawn|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularism is most often associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe and it plays a major role in [[Western culture|Western society]]. The principles, but not necessarily the practices, of [[separation of church and state in the United States]] and ''[[Laïcité]]'' in [[France]] draw heavily on secularism. Secular states also existed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Islam and secularism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). "The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to the belief in the separation of church and state, secularists tend to prefer that politicians make decisions for secular rather than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman Noah (2005). pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, policy decisions pertaining to topics like [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[embryonic stem cell]] research, [[same-sex marriage]], and [[sex education]] are prominently focused upon by American secularist organizations such as the [[Center for Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, November 15, 2006 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/14/AR2006111401176.html "Think Tank Will Promote Thinking" ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfidc.org/declaration.html |title=Declaration in Defense of Science and Secularism |publisher=Cfidc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117073312/http://www.cfidc.org/declaration.html |archive-date=2009-01-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] and scholars (notably in the United States) oppose secularism, often claiming that there is a "radical secularist" ideology being adopted in our current day and they see secularism as a threat to "Christian rights"&lt;ref name="christianpost-jerrys-kids"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a sign that ‘hard secularism’ is taking over from ‘soft secularism’ towards becoming the predominant ideological mindset. According to the terminologi of Barry Kosmin, described earlier in this article.

The most significant forces of religious fundamentalism in the contemporary world are [[Christian fundamentalism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]].  At the same time, one significant stream of secularism has come from religious minorities who see governmental and political secularism as integral to the preservation of equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the well known states that are often considered "[[constitution]]ally secular" are the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mount|first=Steve|title="The Constitution of the United States," Amendment 1 - Freedom of Religion, Press|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am1|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/coifiles/preamble.htm |title=Preamble of the Constitution of India |publisher=Indiacode.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Mexico#Article 3|See article 3 of the 1917 Mexican constitution]], and [[Constitution of Mexico#Article 24|Article 24]]. See also Schmitt (1962) and Blancarte (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]], and [[Turkey]] although none of these nations have identical forms of governance with respect to religion.

Countries with state religion in northern Europe have a high degree of political secularism with systems build upon Protestant and democratic ideology. For example, the monarchy of Denmark have a constitutional right for the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and it is illegal to discriminate individually upon religion, ethnic origins etc.

One of the most wellknown countries with a religious political system is the Islamic republic of Iran.

== Secular society ==
In studies of religion, modern [[democracy|democracies]] are generally recognized as secular. This is due to the near-complete [[freedom of religion]] (beliefs on religion generally are not subject to legal or social sanctions), and the lack of authority of religious leaders over political decisions.  Nevertheless, it has been claimed that surveys done by [[Pew Research Center]] show Americans as generally being more comfortable with religion playing a major role in public life, while in Europe the impact of the church on public life is declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2005/04/21/secular-europe-and-religious-america-implications-for-transatlantic-relations/ |title=Secular Europe and Religious America: Implications for Transatlantic Relations |last= |first= |date= |website= Pew Research Center|publisher= |access-date= 4 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[sociology]] has, since [[Max Weber]], often been preoccupied with the problem of [[authority]] in secularized societies and with [[secularization]] as a sociological or historical process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'', Max Weber, London, Routledge Classics, 2001, pp. 123–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth-century scholars, whose work has contributed to the understanding of these matters, include [[Carl L. Becker]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Hans Blumenberg]], [[Meyer Howard Abrams|M. H. Abrams]], [[Peter L. Berger]], [[Paul Bénichou]] and [[D. L. Munby]], among others.

Some societies become increasingly secular as the result of social processes, rather than through the actions of a dedicated secular movement; this process is known as [[secularization]].

Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] maintained that the modern world can no longer be described as being secular or becoming increasingly secular, instead it can best be described as being pluralistic.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger and Ross Douthat, "Why Hasn't Religion Died Out?", 2015. The Veritas Forum, http://www.veritas.org/why-hasnt-religion-died-out/ Accessed on June 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secular ethics ==
{{main|Secular ethics|Secular religion}}

[[George Holyoake]]'s 1896 publication ''English Secularism'' describes secularism as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Secularism is a code of duty pertaining to this life, founded on considerations purely human, and intended mainly for those who find theology indefinite or inadequate, unreliable or unbelievable. Its essential principles are three: (1) The improvement of this life by material means. (2) That science is the available Providence of man. (3) That it is good to do good. Whether there be other good or not, the good of the present life is good, and it is good to seek that good.&lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, G.J. (1896). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DCg0dcD2bBAC&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=%22Secularism+is+a+code+of+duty+pertaining+to+this+life,+founded+on+considerations+purely+human,+and+intended+mainly+for+those+who+find+theology+indefinite+or+inadequate,+unreliable+or+unbelievable.+Its+essential+principles+are+three:%22 37].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holyoake held that secularism and [[secular ethics]] should take no interest at all in religious questions (as they were irrelevant), and was thus to be distinguished from strong [[freethought]] and atheism. In this he disagreed with [[Charles Bradlaugh]], and the disagreement split the secularist movement between those who argued that anti-religious movements and activism was not necessary or desirable and those who argued that it was.

Contemporary ethical debate in the West is often described as "secular." The work of well known moral philosophers such as [[Derek Parfit]] and [[Peter Singer]], and even the whole field of contemporary bioethics, have been described as explicitly secular or non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Clarendon Press |isbn = 0-19-824615-3 |publication-place = Oxford [Oxfordshire] |title = Reasons and persons |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3172889M/Reasons_and_persons |author = Derek Parfit |publication-date = 1984 |id = 0198246153 |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==American interpretation of secularism==
It has been argued that the concept of secularism has frequently been misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=uooavbjacq&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacques-berlinerblau/secularism-is-not-atheism_b_1699588.html|author=Jacques Berlinerblau|title=Secularism Is Not Atheism|journal=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2012-07-28 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2012 ''[[Huffington Post]]'' article titled ''Secularism Is Not Atheism'', Jacques Berlinerblau, Director of the Program for Jewish Civilization at Georgetown University, wrote that "Secularism must be the most misunderstood and mangled ism in the American political lexicon. Commentators on the right and the left routinely equate it with Stalinism, Nazism and Socialism, among other dreaded isms. In the United States, of late, another false equation has emerged. That would be the groundless association of secularism with atheism. The religious right has profitably promulgated this misconception at least since the 1970s."&lt;ref name=uooavbjacq /&gt;

== Secularism in late 20th century political philosophy ==
It can be seen by many of the organizations (NGO's) for secularism that they prefer to define ''secularism'' as the common ground for all [[life stance]] groups, religious or atheistic, to thrive in a society that honors freedom of speech and conscience. An example of that is the [[National Secular Society]] in the UK.  This is a common understanding of what secularism stands for among many of its activists throughout the world. However, many scholars of Christianity and conservative politicians seem to interpret secularism more often than not, as an antithesis of religion and an attempt to push religion out of society and replace it with [[atheism]] or a void of values, [[nihilism]]. This dual aspect (as noted above in "Secular ethics") has created difficulties in political discourse on the subject. It seems that most political theorists in philosophy following the landmark work of [[John Rawls|John Rawl]]´s ''Theory of Justice'' in 1971 and its following book, ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948824118|title=Political Liberalism : Expanded Edition|last=Inc.|first=Recorded Books,|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9780231527538|location=|pages=457|oclc=948824118}}&lt;/ref&gt; would rather use the conjoined concept ''overlapping consensus'' rather than secularism. In the latter Rawls holds the idea of an overlapping consensus as one of three main ideas of [[Classical liberalism|political liberalism]]. He argues that the term ''secularism'' cannot apply; &lt;blockquote&gt;But what is a secular argument? Some think of any argument that is reflective and critical, publicly intelligible and rational, as a secular argument; [...], Nevertheless, a central feature of political liberalism is that it views all such arguments the same way it views religious ones, and therefore these secular philosophical doctrines do not provide public reasons. Secular concepts and reasoning of this kind belong to [[Metaphysics|first philosophy]] and [[Ethics|moral doctrine]], and fall outside the domain of the political.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Still, Rawl´s theory is akin to Holyoake´s vision of a tolerant democracy that treats all [[life stance]] groups alike. Rawl´s idea it that it is in everybody´s own interest to endorse "a reasonable constitutional democracy" with "principles of toleration". His work has been highly influential on scholars in political philosophy and his term, ''overlapping consensus'', seems to have for many parts replaced ''secularism'' among them. In textbooks on modern political philosophy, like Colin Farelly´s, ''An Introduction to Contemporary Political Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/290530058|title=Contemporary political theory : a reader|last=Patrick.|first=Farrelly, Colin|date=2004-01-01|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761949084|oclc=290530058}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Will Kymlicka´s, ''Contemporary Political Philosophy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/611694157|title=Contemporary political philosophy : an introduction|last=Will.|first=Kymlicka,|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198782742|oclc=611694157}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term secularism is not even indexed and in the former it can be seen only in one footnote. However, there is no shortage of discussion and coverage of the topic it involves. It is just called ''overlapping consensus, [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]'', ''[[multiculturalism]]'' or expressed in some other way. In The ''Oxford Handbook of Political Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/474737332|title=The Oxford handbook of political theory|last=1953-|first=Dryzek, John S.,|last2=Bonnie.|first2=Honig,|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199270033|location=|pages=636|oclc=474737332}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is one chapter called "Political secularism", by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. It covers secularism in a global context and starts with this sentence: "Secularism is a beleaguered doctrine."

== Organizations ==
{{main|List of secularist organizations}}

Groups such as the [[National Secular Society]] (United Kingdom) and [[Americans United]] campaign for secularism are often supported by [[Humanism|Humanists]]. In 2005, the National Secular Society held the inaugural "Secularist of the Year" awards ceremony. The award's first winner was [[Maryam Namazie]], of the [[Worker-Communist Party of Iran]] and the [[Central Council of Ex-Muslims#Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain|Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Secular Society]] is active in Scotland and is currently focused on the role of religion in education. In 2013 it raised a petition at the [[Scottish Parliament]] to have the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1980]]  changed so that parents will have to make a positive choice to opt into [[Religious Observance]].

Another secularist organization is the [[Secular Coalition for America]]. The Secular Coalition for America lobbies and advocates for separation of church and state as well as the acceptance and inclusion of Secular Americans in American life and public policy.  While Secular Coalition for America is linked to many secular humanistic organizations and many [[secular humanism|secular humanists]] support it, as with the Secular Society, some non-humanists support it.

Local organizations work to raise the profile of secularism in their communities and tend to include secularists, freethinkers, atheists, agnostics, and humanists under their organizational umbrella.

Student organizations, such as the [[Toronto Secular Alliance]], try to popularize nontheism and secularism on campus.  The [[Secular Student Alliance]] is an educational nonprofit that organizes and aids such high school and college secular student groups.

In Turkey, the most prominent and active secularist organization is [[Atatürkist Thought Association]] (ADD), which is credited for organizing the [[Republic Protests]] – demonstrations in the four largest cities in Turkey in 2007, where over 2 million people, mostly women, defended their concern in and support of secularist principles introduced by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].

[[Leicester Secular Society]] founded in 1851 is the world's oldest secular society.

'''Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders''' ({{lang-fi|Työväen ja Pienviljelijäin Sosialidemokraattinen Liitto}}, TPSL) was a political party in [[Finland]]. TPSL originated as a fraction of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]], headed by [[Emil Skog]] and [[Aarre Simonen]]. Skog was the former chairman of SDP and was in dispute with the incumbent chairman, Väinö Leskinen. The party was founded in 1959, had seats in the parliament in 1959–1970 and was dissolved in 1973. It was generally identified as being politically between SDP and [[Finnish People's Democratic League|SKDL]] (a Communist-dominated organization).
==History==
The fraction split from SDP in 1959 after few years of infighting, and retained SDP's party platform until 1967, opining that SDP didn't follow its own platform. The main cause for the rift was that SDP's party leadership, particularly [[Väinö Tanner]] and [[Väinö Leskinen]] wanted to develop the party towards a "general party" appealing to the entire public. TPSL in contrast, as the name suggests, wanted SDP to be a special interest party for the workers and small farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Rauli Mickelsson. Suomen puolueet - Historia, muutos ja nykypäivä. Vastapaino 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Leskinen wanted to co-operate with the right wing, based SDP politics on the general population, and his economic policy was conservative and deflatory, and he criticised [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]]. In contrast, Skog's fraction wanted to co-operate with the agrarians and other leftists in [[popular front]] governments (''kansanrintamahallitus''), and base their politics exclusively on the trade unions. For example, Heikki Laavola has written that the disagreement was not over left vs. right ideology; all of Tanner, Leskinen, Skog and Simonen had been formerly active in anti-Communist pursuits. Disagreements between and about individuals played a role; Tanner had actually been convicted (under Soviet pressure) for being responsible to the [[Continuation War]], and as such, he being the leader of SDP was a problem to the Soviets.

The rift was accompanied by a division in associated societies and the trade unions. The main trade union, [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]], was controlled mostly by Skog's men, as was [[Socialist Youth League of Finland|the youth league]], [[Finnish Workers' Sports Federation|sports federation]] and [[Social Democratic Women's League (Finland)|women's league]]. The first example was that SDP's leadership wanted the worker's sports federation to associate with the right-wing sports federation in order to qualify for entry to [[Olympics]], which Skog's fraction disputed as bourgeoise.

TPSL had 13-15 representatives of 200 in the [[Eduskunta|parliament]] after the split in 1959, gained only two in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1962|1962 elections]], got seven representatives in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1966|1966]] and permanently dropped out of the parliament in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1970|1970]]. Significantly, TPSL co-operated with the especially powerful President [[Urho Kekkonen]], and was a partner in coalition cabinets (Karjalainen I, Paasio I, Koivisto I). In 1963, SDP changed its policy such that good relations with Kekkonen and Soviet Union were a new priority, thus removing a significant cause for disagreement. Skog himself returned to SDP in 1965. TPSL radicalized and became more Soviet-friendly, but lost its popular support, and was dissolved in 1973. The decision was made in December 1972 as TPSL board voted 10–3 for the return to the SDP.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Devlin: [http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/142-1-302.shtml Death of a Splinter Party: Finland's Left-Socialists Give Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108085222/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/142-1-302.shtml |date=2012-01-08 }} (Radio Free Europe 5.12.1972)&lt;/ref&gt; A minority faction, including Simonen and some other former MPs, formed the [[Socialist Workers Party (Finland)|Socialist Workers Party]].

A '''[[state (subnational)|state]] government''' is the [[government]] of a [[country subdivision]] in a [[federation|federal]] [[form of government]], which shares [[political power]] with the [[federal government|federal]] or [[central government|national government]]. A state government may have some level of political [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]], or be subject to the direct control of the federal government. This relationship may be defined by a [[constitution]].

The reference to "state" denotes country subdivisions which are officially or widely known as "states", and should not be confused with a "[[sovereign state]]". Provinces are usually divisions of unitary states. Their governments, which are also ''provincial governments'', are not the subject of this article.

The [[United States]] and [[Australia]] are the main examples of [[Federation|federal]] systems in which the term "state" is used for the subnational components of the federation. In addition, the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian provinces]] fulfil a similar role. The term for subnational units in non-English-speaking federal countries may also often be translated as "state", e.g. [[States of Germany]] (German ''Länder'').

==Australia==
{{main|States and territories of Australia}}
The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] is a [[Federation|federal]] nation with six states (and two mainland territories). [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution]] sets out the division of [[legislature|legislative]] power between the states and the Commonwealth (federal) government. The Commonwealth government is given a variety of legislative powers, including control of [[foreign policy]], [[taxation]] (although this cannot discriminate between states or parts of states), and regulation of interstate [[commerce]] and [[corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm Section 51 of the Australian Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014193759/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm |date=2011-10-14 }} at theamericanParliament website&lt;/ref&gt; Since the original ratification of the constitution, the [[High Court of Australia]] has settled a number of disputes concerning the extent of the Commonwealth's legislative powers, some of which have been controversial and extensively criticised; these included a dispute in 1982 over whether the Commonwealth was entitled to designate land for national heritage purposes under [[United Nations]] agreements,&lt;ref&gt;Barwick, Sir Garfield, [http://www.samuelgriffith.org.au/papers/html/volume6/v6chap1.htm A View of the External Affairs Power], Samuel Griffith Society&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous disputes over the extent of the Commonwealth's power over [[trade union]] and [[industrial relations]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Creighton, Breen |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2000/33.html |title=One Hundred Years of the Conciliation and Arbitration Power: A Province Lost?}} (2000) 24(3) Melbourne University Law Review 839.&lt;/ref&gt;

One difference between the Australian and [[United States]] models of federalism is that, in Australia, the Commonwealth Parliament has explicit constitutional power over [[marriage]] legislation; this has been a focal point for recent controversies over [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2001-02/02rn17.pdf The High Court and the Meaning of 'Marriage' in Section 51(xxi) of the Constitution], Australian Parliamentary Library&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government structure===
{{see also|Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|Premiers of the Australian states}}

Each state of Australia has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], who represents the [[Queen of Australia]] (currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]) and performs the ceremonial duties of a [[head of state]]. Every state also has a [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|parliament]]; most states have a [[bicameral]] parliament, except for [[Queensland]], where the upper chamber (the [[Legislative Council]]) was abolished in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/view/historical/historical.asp?area=council&amp;LIndex=6&amp;SubArea=presidents The Legislative Council of Queensland]{{Dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, Queensland Parliament website&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike their [[United States]] counterparts, Australian states have a [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary government; the head of government, known in each state as a [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]], is drawn from the  state parliament.

==India==
{{see also|List of States of India by type of legislature}}
In [[India]], the state governments are the level of governments below the central government. India is  a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic  with a Parliamentary system of government. The Republic is governed in terms of the Constitution. Sovereignty is shared between the centre and the state government, but the central government is given greater powers. The President is the constitutional head Executive of the Union. Real executive power vests in a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as head of government. The State resembles the federal system. In the states, the Governor is the head of Executive, but real executive power vests with the Chief Minister who heads the Council of Ministers. The judicial setup of the country is headed by the Chief justice, who presides over one of the largest judicial apparatus dispensing criminal, civil and all other forms of litigation. The government head of its legal wing is the Attorney General of India.

== Nigeria==
{{see also|States of Nigeria}}
In [[Nigeria]], States are constituent political entities, which shares sovereignty with the Federal Government of Nigeria. In the [[Nigerian constitution|Nigerian Constitution]] all powers not granted to the States are reserved to the Federal Government.

==Pakistan==
{{see also|Provincial Governments of Pakistan}}
In [[Pakistan]], the provincial governments are the level of government below the federal government. Pakistan is a Sovereign [[Islamic Republic]] and a unitary Parliamentary [[Multi-party system]] form of a [[Central government|National Government]].

==South Africa==
{{main|Provincial governments of South Africa}}
South Africa is divided into [[Provinces of South Africa|nine provinces]] which have their own elected governments. Chapter Six of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] describes the division of power between the national government and the provincial governments, listing those "functional areas" of government that are exclusively reserved to the provincial governments and those where both levels of government have concurrent powers; the remaining areas not listed are reserved to the national government. In areas where both levels have concurrent powers there is a complex set of rules in the event of a conflict between national and provincial legislation. Generally in such a case the provincial legislation prevails, but national legislation may prescribe standards and frameworks for provinces to follow, and may prevent provinces from adversely affecting national interests or the interests of other provinces. The functional areas in which the provincial governments have powers include agriculture, arts and culture, primary and secondary education, the environment and tourism, health, housing, roads and transport, and social welfare.

The provincial governments are structured according to a [[parliamentary system]] in which the executive is dependent on and accountable to the legislature. The unicameral [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]] is elected by [[party-list proportional representation]], and the legislature in turn elects one of its members as [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] to head the executive. The Premier appoints an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Executive Council]] (a cabinet), consisting of members of the legislature, to administer the various [[government department|departments]] of the provincial administration.

{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Statute of the Jewry''' was a [[statute]] issued by [[Edward I of England]] in 1275. It placed a number of restrictions on [[Jews]] of [[England]], most notably outlawing the practice of [[usury]].&lt;ref name="Prestwich"&gt;Prestwich, Michael. Edward I p 345 (1997) Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-07157-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Since the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], Jews had been filling a small but vital role in the English economy. Usury by [[Christian]]s was banned by the [[Catholic Church]] at the time, but Jews were permitted to act as [[moneylenders]] and bankers. That position enabled some Jews to amass tremendous wealth, but also earned them the enmity of the English populace,&lt;ref&gt; Rubenstein, W.D. A History of the Jews p 36 (1996) Macmillan Press. {{ISBN|0-333-55833-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which added to the increasing [[antisemitic]] sentiments of the time, due to widespread indebtedness and financial ruin among the [[gentile]] population.

When Edward returned from the [[Crusades]] in 1274, two years after his accession as [[King of England]], he found that land had become a commodity, and that many of his subjects had become dispossessed and were in danger of destitution. Jews traded land for money, and land was often mortgaged to Jewish moneylenders.

As special direct subjects of the [[King of England|monarch]], Jews could be taxed indiscriminately by the King. Some have described the situation as indirect usury: the monarch permitting and encouraging Jews to practise usury and then taxing the profit. In the years leading up to the Statute, Edward taxed them heavily to help finance his forthcoming military campaigns in [[Wales]], which commenced in 1277. One theory{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} holds that he had exhausted the financial resources of the Jewish community when the Statute was passed in 1275.&lt;ref name="Prestwich" /&gt;

==Provisions==
* Usury was outlawed in every form.
* Debtors of Jews were no longer liable for certain debts.
* Jews were not allowed to live outside certain cities and towns.
* Any Jew above the age of seven had to wear a [[yellow badge]] of felt on his or her outer clothing, six inches by three inches.
* All Jews from the age of 12 on had to pay a special tax of three pence annually.
* Christians were forbidden to live among Jews.
* Jews were licensed to buy farmland to make their living for the next 15 years.
* Jews could thenceforth make a living in England only as merchants, farmers, craftsmen or soldiers.

The licence to buy land was included so that farming, along with trading, could give Jews an opportunity to earn a living with the abolition of usury. Unfortunately, other provisions along with widespread prejudice made this difficult for many.&lt;ref&gt; Glassman, David. Anti-Semitic Stereotypes p 17 (1975) Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|0-8143-1545-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After fifteen years had passed, it was discovered that Jews widely but secretly continued to practise usury, leading Edward I to issue the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, James. The Jew in the Medieval Community p 394 (1976) Hermon Press. {{ISBN|0-87203-059-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">'''Technolibertarianism''', sometimes referred to as '''cyberlibertarianism''', is a [[political philosophy]] with roots in the internet’s early hacker [[cypherpunk]] culture in [[Silicon Valley]] in the early 1990s and in American libertarianism that focuses on minimizing government regulation, censorship or anything else in the way of a "free" World Wide Web. In this case the word "free" is referring to the meaning of ''libre'' (no restrictions) not ''gratis'' (no cost). Cyber-libertarians embrace fluid, meritocratic hierarchies (which are believed to be best served by markets). The most widely known cyberlibertarian is [[Julian Assange]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurgenson, N.

Technolibertarian principles are defined as:
* The policy should always be considerate of [[civil liberties]]
* The policy should oppose [[government]] over [[regulation]]
* The policy that provides [[Homo economicus|rational, free market]] incentives is the best choice

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9063">In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]] the term '''tenant-in-chief'''  (or '''vassal-in-chief'''), denoted a person who held his lands under various forms of [[feudal land tenure]]  directly from the king or territorial prince to whom he did homage, as opposed to holding them from another nobleman or senior member of the [[clergy]].&lt;ref name=Bloch333&gt;Bloch ''Feudal Society Volume 2'' p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict272&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms &amp; Phrases'' p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The tenure was one which denoted great honour, but also carried heavy responsibilities as the tenants-in-chief were originally responsible for providing knights and soldiers for the king's feudal army.&lt;ref&gt;Bracton, who indiscriminately called tenants-in-chief "barons" stated: "sunt et alii potentes sub rege qui barones dicuntur, hoc est robur belli" ("there are other magnates under the king, who are called barons, that is the hardwood of war"), quoted in Sanders, I.J., Feudal Military Service in England, Oxford, 1956, p.3; "Bracton's definition of the ''baro''" (plur ''barones'') "proves that tenants of this class were considered to be the military backbone of the realm" (Sanders, p.3)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Feudal status}}
==Etymology==
Other names for tenant-in-chief were [[captal]] or [[baron]],{{efn|Baron was the term used in the ''Cartae Baronum'' of 1166, a return of all tenants-in-chief, not just those who held per baroniam.}} although the latter term came to mean specifically one who held in-chief by the tenure ''per baroniam'', the [[English feudal barony|feudal baron]].&lt;ref name=Bloch333/&gt; The [[Latin]] term was ''tenens in [[capite]]''.&lt;ref name=Coredon161&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Tenens (singular), tenentes (plur)}}

==History==
In most countries [[Allodial title|allodial property]] could be held by laypeople or the church; however in England after the [[Norman Conquest]], the king became in law the only holder of land by allodial title; thus all the lands in England became the property of the Crown.&lt;ref name="ganshof130"&gt;Ganshof ''Feudalism'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ganshof165"&gt;Ganshof ''Feudalism'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; A tenure by [[frankalmoin]], which in other countries was regarded as a form of privileged allodial holding, was in England regarded as a [[Tenement (law)|feudal tenement]].  Every land-holding  was deemed by feudal custom to be no more than an  [[estate in land]] whether directly or indirectly held  of the king; absolute title in land could only be held by the king himself, the most anyone else could hold was a right over land, not a title in land ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ganshof165"/&gt; In England, a tenant-in-chief could enfief, or grant fiefs carved out of his own holding, to his own followers. The creation of subfiefs under a tenant-in-chief or other fief-holder was known as [[subinfeudation]].&lt;ref name=Word240&gt;Cosman ''Medieval Wordbook'' p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman kings, however, eventually imposed on all free men (i.e. those whose tenures were "freehold", that is to say for life or heritable by their heirs) who occupied a tenement a duty of [[fealty]] to the crown rather than to their immediate lord who had enfeoffed them. This was to diminish the possibility of sub-vassals being employed by tenants-in-chief against the crown.&lt;ref name="ganshof165"/&gt;

In the great feudal survey [[Domesday Book]] (1087), tenants-in-chief were listed first in each county's entry.&lt;ref name=Dict272/&gt;. The lands held by a tenant-in-chief in England, if comprising a large [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]], were called an [[honour (feudal land tenure)|honour]].&lt;ref name="ganshof166"&gt;Ganshof ''Feudalism'' p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties of tenants-in-chief==
As feudal lord, the king had the right to collect [[scutage]] from the barons who held these ''honours''.&lt;ref name="bartlett164"&gt;Bartlett ''England under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Scutage (literally ''shield money'', from ''[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]'') was a tax collected from vassals in lieu of military service. The payment of scutage rendered the crown more independent of the [[Feudalism|feudal levy]] and enabled it to pay for troops on its own.&lt;ref name="ganshof166"/&gt; Once a tenant-in-chief received a demand for scutage, the cost was passed on to the sub-tenants and thus came to be regarded as a universal land tax.&lt;ref name="bartlett164"/&gt; This tax was a development from the taxation system created under the Anglo-Saxon kings to raise money to pay off the invading Danes, the so-called [[Danegeld]].&lt;ref name="bartlett165"&gt;Bartlett ''England under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heirs===
When an English tenant-in-chief died, an [[inquisition post mortem]] was held in each county in which he held land and his or her land temporarily [[escheat]]ed (i.e.reverted) to the [[demesne]] of the crown until the heir paid a sum of money (a [[Feudal relief|relief]]), and was then able to take possession ([[livery of seisin]]) of the lands. However, if the heir was underage (under 21 for a male heir, under 14 for an heiress) they would be subject to a ''feudal wardship'' where the custody of their lands and the right to arrange their marriage passed to the monarch, until they came of age. The wardship and marriage was not usually kept in Crown hands, but was sold, often simply to the highest bidder, unless outbid by the next of kin.&lt;ref name=national1&gt;''Court of Wards and Liveries: land inheritance 1540–1645''&lt;/ref&gt;

When an heir came of age, he or she passed out of wardship but could not enter upon their inheritance until, like all heirs of full age on inheritance, they had sued out their livery. In either case, the process was complicated.&lt;ref name=national1/&gt; Eventually a warrant was issued for the livery to pass under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]].&lt;ref name=national1/&gt; From its inception in 1540, The [[Court of Wards and Liveries]] administered the funds received from the wardships, marriages and the granting of livery; both courts and practice were abolished in 1646&lt;ref name="friar465"&gt;Friar ''Sutton Companion to Local History'' p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; and the whole system of feudal tenure&amp;nbsp;— except for [[fee simple]] - was abolished by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]].

"'''The Engineering of Consent'''" is an [[essay]] by [[Edward Bernays]] first published in 1947, and a [[#Book|book]] he published in 1955.

==Overview==

In his own words, Bernays describes engineering consent as "use  of  an  engineering  approach—that is, action  based  only  on   thorough  knowledge of  the  situation  and  on  the  application  of  scientific  principles  and  tried practices  to  the  task  of  getting  people to   support   ideas   and  programs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernays|first1=Edward|title=The engineering of consent.|date=1969|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=9780806103280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernays explained, "Professionally, [public relations] activities are planned and executed by trained practitioners in accordance with scientific principles, based on the findings of [[social scientist]]s. Their dispassionate approach and methods may be likened to those of the engineering professions which stem from the [[physical science]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Bernays 1955 page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat of engineered consent in democracy has been expressed in a textbook on American government:&lt;ref&gt;John C. Livingston &amp; Robert G. Thompson (1966) ''The Consent of the Governed'', 2nd edition, page 11, [[Collier Macmillan]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Under modern conditions of political advertising and manipulation, it has become possible to talk of the engineering of consent by an elite of experts and professional politicians. Consent that is thus engineered is difficult to distinguish in any fundamental way from the consent that supports modern totalitarian governments. Were the manipulated voter to become the normal voter, the government he supports could hardly be said to rest on his consent in any traditional sense of that word.

To some observers, [[Consumer psychology|consumer psychologists]] have already made the choice for people before they buy a certain product. [[Marketing]] is often based on themes and symbols that unconsciously influence consumer behavior.

* The United States has become a small room where a single whisper is magnified thousands of times.
* There are two divisions in media: commercial and organized group information systems.
* Today’s leaders have become more remote physically from the public, yet, at the same time, the public has much greater familiarity with these leaders through the system of modern communications...Increased influence of mass media is due to widespread and enormously rapid diffusion of [[literacy]].
* With the aid of technicians in the field who have specialized in utilizing the channels of communications, [some leaders] have been able to achieve purposefully and scientifically what we have termed "the engineering of consent".
* The freedoms of press, speech, petition and assembly, the freedoms which make the engineering of consent possible, are among the most cherished guarantees in the Constitution of the United States.
* Under no circumstances should the engineering of consent supersede or displace the educational system, either formal or informal, in bringing about understanding by the people as the basis for their actions. The engineering of consent often does supplement the educational process.
* The chief function [of the profession] is to analyze objectively and realistically the position of its client vis-a-vis a public, and to advise as to the necessary corrections in its client’s attitudes towards and approaches to that public.
* It must be remembered of course that good will, the basis of lasting adjustment, can be preserved in the long run, only by those whose actions warrant it...The public relations counsel has the professional responsibility to push only those ideas that he can respect, and not to promote causes or accept assignments for clients he considers anti-social.
* As in physical engineering, a feasibility study must be done and a budget drawn up.
* The engineer of consent must be powerfully equipped with facts, with truths, with evidence before he shows himself before a public.
* Bernays recommends ''[[World Almanac]]'' with lists of thousands of [[voluntary association|associations]] across the United States – a cross-section of the country.
* The public’s attitudes, ideas, presumptions or prejudices result from definite influences. One must try to find out what they are in any situation in which one is working.
* Democratic society is actually only a loose aggregate of constituent groups...To influence the public, the engineer of consent works with and through group leaders and opinion moulders on every level.
* [[Research]] furnishes the equivalent of the mariner's chart, the architect's blue print,the traveler's road map.
* Themes must appeal to the motives of the public. [[Motivation|Motives]] are the activation of both conscious and subconscious pressure created by the force of desires
* Organization also correlates the activities of any specialists who may be called upon from time to time, such as opinion researchers, fund raisers, publicity men, radio and motion picture experts, specialists for women's clubs or foreign language groups, and the like.
* Set in motion a broad activity, the success of which depends on interlocking all phases and elements of the proposed strategy, implemented by tactics that are timed to the moment of maximum effectiveness.
* The developing of events and circumstances that are not routine is one of the basic functions of the engineer of consent.

==Book==
In 1955 [[University of Oklahoma Press]] published Bernays' book ''The Engineering of Consent''.  In fact Bernays contributed only the first chapter (22 pages) "The Theory and Practice of Public Relations: A Resumé". The seven other chapters were by his associates: "Objectives" by Howard Walden Cutler, "Research" by Sherwood Dodge, "Strategy" by [[Nicholas Samstag]], "Themes and Symbols" by [[Doris Fleischman]] and H.W. Cutler, "Organization for public relations" by John Price Jones, "Planning" by [[Benjamin Fine]], and "The tactics of public relations" by A. Robert Ginsburgh.

The longest chapter, the one on strategy, begins with sociological and psychological observations on human motivation drawn from [[Karl Menninger]] and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]. Samstag illustrates varieties of strategy with sample cases before the public. He details aspects of timing, forbearance, approach, surprise, participation, association, disassociation, crossroads, personalization, bland withdrawal, apparent withdrawal, apparent runner-up, omission, reversal, mosaic, and understatement.

===Reviews===
A. Edgar Schuler&lt;ref&gt;A. Edgar Schuler (1956) [http://chla.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=chla;cc=chla;rgn=full%20text;idno=5075626_4307_001;didno=5075626_4307_001;view=image;seq=0084;node=5075626_4307_001%3A5.13 Review: The Engineering of Consent], Rural Sociology 21(1):80, link from [[Cornell University]] Core Historical Literature of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; called the book a "convenient and compact introduction to the field of public relations." He singles out Samstag’s chapter as "interesting, enlightening, provocative, and poignant."

M. Weisglas reviewed the book for [[International Communication Gazette]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Weisglas (1956) "Review: Engineering of Consent", [[International Communication Gazette]] 2:59&lt;/ref&gt; panning it saying "Bernay’s and company have deluded their readers with false hopes about public relations- truths."

==Women’s smoking==
{{See also|Tobacco advertising}}
In a practical example of Edward Bernays’ theory detailed in his essay, [[George Washington Hill]], president of the [[American Tobacco Company]], hired Edward Bernays in 1928 to lead a campaign to entice more women to smoke in public.&lt;ref name="1929 Torches of Freedom"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is believed to have helped converting attitudes towards women's smoking from a social [[taboo]] to a more socially acceptable act.&lt;ref name="1929 Torches of Freedom" /&gt; Bernays did this by associating women’s smoking with the ideas of "power" and "freedom" which he did by using the slogan [[Torches of Freedom]] during a famous parade in [[New York City]].

The idea of “Engineering of Consent” was motivated by [[Freud]]’s idea that humans are irrational beings, and are motivated primarily by inner desires hidden in their [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. If one understood what those unconscious desires were, then one could use this to one’s advantage to sell products and increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn T. Tanoue (2000) "Cigarette Smoking and Women's Respiratory Health", ''Clinics in Chest Medicine'' 21(1): 47–65 {{doi| 10.1016/S0272-5231(05)70007-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The Engineering of Consent also applies to the pioneered application of Freudian psychoanalytic concepts and techniques to business—in particular to the study of consumer behavior in the marketplace. Ideas established strongly influenced the practices of the advertising industry in the twentieth century.

The techniques applied developing the "consumer lifestyle" were also later applied to developing theories in [[cultural commodification]]; which has proven successful in the later 20th century (with diffusion of cultures throughout North America) to sell ethnic foods and style in popular mainstream culture by removing them from geography and ethnic histories and sanitizing them for a general public.

[[Ernest Dichter]] applied what he dubbed "the strategy of desire" for building a "stable society," by creating for the public a common identity through the products they consumed; again, much like with cultural commodification, where culture has no "identity," "meaning," or "history" inherited from previous generations, but rather, is created by the attitudes which are introduced by consumer behaviors and social patterns of the period. According to Dichter, "To understand a stable citizen, you have to know that modern man quite often tries to work off his frustrations by spending on self-sought gratification. Modern man is internally ready to fulfill his self-image, by purchasing products which compliment it."
