In the [[history of science]], the '''clockwork universe''' compares the universe to a [[clockwork|mechanical clock]]. It continues ticking along, as a perfect machine, with its gears governed by the [[laws of physics]], making every aspect of the machine predictable.

== History ==

This idea was very popular among [[Deism|deists]]{{ref}} during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when [[Isaac Newton]] derived his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]], and showed that alongside the law of universal [[gravitation]], they could explain the behaviour of both [[motion (physics)|terrestrial objects]] and the [[solar system]].

A similar concept goes back, to [[Johannes de Sacrobosco|John of Sacrobosco's]] early 13th-century introduction to astronomy: ''[[De sphaera mundi|On the Sphere of the World]]''. In this widely popular medieval text, Sacrobosco spoke of the universe as the ''machina mundi'', the machine of the world, suggesting that the reported eclipse of the Sun at the crucifixion of Jesus was a disturbance of the order of that machine.&lt;ref&gt;John of Sacrbosco, ''On the Sphere'', quoted in Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr., 1974), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to [[Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Richard Danielson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5YOEaO_KO_cC&amp;pg=PA246 The Book of the Cosmos: Imagining the Universe from Heraclitus to Hawking]'', [[Basic Books]], 2001 (p. 246)&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent supporter of the theory, in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]], [[Samuel Clarke]] wrote:

:"The Notion of the World's being a great Machine, going on without the Interposition of God, as a Clock continues to go without the Assistance of a Clockmaker; is the Notion of Materialism and Fate, and tends, (under pretence of making God a Supra-mundane Intelligence,) to exclude Providence and God's Government in reality out of the World."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Edward B. 1991. "Newton's rejection of the "Newtonian world view" : the role of divine will in Newton's natural philosophy." Science and Christian Belief 3, no. 2: 103-117. Clarke quotation taken from article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 artist [[Tim Wetherell]] created a large wall piece for [[Questacon]] (The National Science and Technology centre in Canberra, Australia) representing the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the [[lunar terminator]].

'''Cosmic time''' (also known as '''time since the big bang''') is the [[time]] [[coordinate]] commonly used in the [[Big Bang]] models of [[physical cosmology]].  It is defined for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], [[Cosmic expansion|expanding]] universes as follows:  Choose a time coordinate so that the universe has the same [[density]] everywhere at each moment in time (the fact that this is possible means that the universe is, by definition, homogeneous).  Measure the passage of time using [[Clock|clocks]] moving with the [[Hubble flow]].  Choose the big bang singularity as the origin of the time coordinate. 

Cosmic time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|publisher=Academic Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Bonometto|first=Silvio|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0750308109|location=Bristol and Philadelphia|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of time by a physical clock with zero [[Peculiar velocity#Cosmology|peculiar velocity]] in the absence of matter over-/under-densities (to prevent time dilation due to relativistic effects or confusions caused by expansion of the universe). Unlike other measures of time such as temperature, redshift, particle horizon, or Hubble horizon, the cosmic time (similar and complementary to the comoving coordinates) is blind to the expansion of the universe. 

There are two main ways for establishing a reference point for the cosmic time. The most trivial way is to take the present time as the cosmic reference point (sometimes referred to as the lookback time) or alternatively, take the [[Big Bang]] as &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; (also referred to as age of the universe). The big bang doesn't necessarily have to correspond to a physical event but rather it refers to the point at which the scale factor would vanish for a standard cosmological model such as ΛCDM. For instance, in the case of inflation, i.e. a non-standard cosmology, the hypothetical moment of big bang is still determined using the benchmark cosmological models which may coincide with the end of the inflationary epoch. For inflationary models, it is not possible to establish a well defined origin of time before the big bang since the universe does not require a beginning event in such models. For technical purposes, concepts such as the average temperature of the universe (in units of eV) or the particle horizon are used when the early universe is the objective of a study since understanding the interaction among particles is more relevant than their time coordinate or age. 

Cosmic time is the standard time coordinate for specifying the [[Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker metric|Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker solutions]] of [[Einstein's equations]].

'''Cosmology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κόσμος, ''kosmos'' "world" and -λογία, ''-logia'' "study of") is the study of the [[Chronology of the universe|origin, evolution, and eventual fate]] of the [[universe]]. [[Physical cosmology]] is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate,]] as well as the [[Laws of science|scientific laws]] that govern these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9988-instant-expert-cosmology.html "Introduction: Cosmology – space"]. ''New Scientist''. 4 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cosmology'' was first used in English in 1656 in [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s ''Glossographia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals): Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology |first1=Norriss S. |last1=Hetherington |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-317-67766-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1731 taken up in Latin by [[German philosophy|German philosopher]] [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in ''Cosmologia Generalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wraparound Universe |first1=Jean-Pierre |last1=Luminet |publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4398-6496-8 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 Extract of page 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[creation myth]]s and [[eschatology]].

Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as [[Astronomy|astronomers]] and [[Physics|physicists]], as well as [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]], and [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophers of space and time]].  Because of this shared scope with [[philosophy]], [[theory|theories]] in physical cosmology may include both [[science|scientific]] and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be [[hypothesis|tested]]. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual [[celestial object]]s. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which attempts to bring together [[observational astronomy]] and [[particle physics]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology "Cosmology"] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.

[[Astrophysics#Theoretical astrophysics|Theoretical astrophysicist]] [[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] |title= Cosmology Today |journal=Daedalus |date=Fall 2014|volume=143|issue=4 |pages=125–133| doi = 10.1162/DAED_a_00312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [[Physical cosmology]] was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]]; an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged [[Age of the universe|13.799 ± 0.021]] [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters (See Table 4 on page 31 of PDF)|arxiv=1502.01589|bibcode=2016A&amp;A...594A..13P|author=Planck Collaboration|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201525830|volume=594|issue=13|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|pages=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmogony]] studies the origin of the Universe, and [[cosmography]] maps the features of the Universe.

In [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopédie]], cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=  |title=Detailed Explanation of the System of Human Knowledge

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical cosmology===
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[[celestial mechanics]]", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317" /&gt;]] 
[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]—that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst Öpik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.

{{Physical cosmology}}
In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way&lt;!-- and has galaxies of their own--&gt;&lt;!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.--&gt;.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[Redshift|red shift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious or mythological cosmology===
{{See also|Religious cosmology}}

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[Creation myth|creation]] and [[eschatology]].

===Philosophical cosmology===
{{See also|Cosmology (philosophy)}}

Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crouch |first1=C. L. |title=Genesis 1:26-7 As a statement of humanity's divine parentage |date=8 February 2010 |journal=The Journal of Theological Studies |pages=1–15 |volume=61 |issue=1 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jts/article/61/1/1/1673983 |accessdate=17 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern use metaphysical cosmology addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of science. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like [[dialectic]]s. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2015|title=Publications - Cosmos|website=www.cosmos.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])
* Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [[epistemology]])

| [[Hindu cosmology]]
| [[Rigveda]] (c. 1700–1100 BC)
| Cyclical or oscillating, Infinite in time
| One cycle of existence is around 311 trillion years and the life of one universe around 8 billion years. This Universal cycle is preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes. Includes an infinite number of universes at one given time.

|-
|  [[Jain cosmology]]
|  [[Jain Agamas]] (written around 500 AD as per the teachings of [[Mahavira]] 599–527 BC)
|  Cyclical or oscillating, eternal and finite 
|  Jain cosmology considers the ''[[loka]]'', or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to [[Jainism]], is broad at the top, narrow at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.

|-
| [[Babylonian astronomy#Cosmology|Babylonian cosmology]]
| [[Assyro-Babylonian literature|Babylonian literature]] (c. 3000 BC)
| Flat earth floating in infinite "waters of chaos"
| The Earth and the [[Heaven]]s form a unit within infinite "waters of chaos"; the earth is flat and circular, and a solid dome (the "firmament") keeps out the outer "chaos"-ocean.
|-
| [[Eleatics|Eleatic cosmology]]
| [[Parmenides]] (c. 515 BC)
| Finite and spherical in extent
| The Universe is unchanging, uniform, perfect, necessary, timeless, and neither generated nor perishable. Void is impossible. Plurality and change are products of epistemic ignorance derived from sense experience. Temporal and spatial limits are arbitrary and relative to the Parmenidean whole.

|-
| [[Atomism|Atomist universe]]
| [[Anaxagoras]] (500–428&amp;nbsp;BC) &amp; later [[Epicurus]]
| Infinite in extent
| The universe contains only two things: an infinite number of tiny seeds ([[atom]]s) and the void of infinite extent. All atoms are made of the same substance, but differ in size and shape. Objects are formed from atom aggregations and decay back into atoms. Incorporates [[Leucippus]]' principle of [[causality]]: "nothing happens at random; everything happens out of reason and necessity". The universe was not ruled by [[gods]].{{citation needed|reason=Ancient Greeks typically believed that nothing was random *because* there were gods – for instance, when you elected a leader by drawing straws, the person 'randomly' elected leader was the one chosen by the gods!  The random selection was intended to minimize human influence on the outcome of the election, not to eliminate the influence of mount olympus – which would have been considered impossible, by typical Greek thinkers at least.  Perhaps Anaxagoras was atypical in *that* way, as well as atypical in believing in some primitive version of the atomic theory, but methinks not.|date=January 2013}}

| [[Pythagorean astronomical system|Pythagorean universe]]
| [[Philolaus]] (d. 390 BC)
| Existence of a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe.
| At the center of the Universe is a central fire, around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and [[planet]]s revolve uniformly. The Sun revolves around the central fire once a year, the stars are immobile. The earth in its motion maintains the same hidden face towards the central fire, hence it is never seen. First known non-geocentric model of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Carl B.

|-
| [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian universe]]
| [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC)
| [[Geocentric]], static, steady state, finite extent, infinite time
| Spherical earth is surrounded by concentric [[celestial spheres]]. Universe exists unchanged throughout eternity. Contains a fifth element, called [[aether (classical element)|aether]], that was added to the four [[classical element]]s.
|-
| Aristarchean universe
| [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] (circa&amp;nbsp;280&amp;nbsp;BC)
| [[Heliocentric]]
| Earth rotates daily on its axis and revolves annually about the sun in a circular orbit. Sphere of fixed stars is centered about the sun.
|-
| [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic model]]
| [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century&amp;nbsp;AD)
| Geocentric (based on Aristotelian universe)
| Universe orbits around a stationary Earth. Planets move in circular [[epicycles]], each having a center that moved in a larger circular orbit (called an eccentric or a deferent) around a center-point near Earth. The use of [[equant]]s added another level of complexity and allowed astronomers to predict the positions of the planets. The most successful universe model of all time, using the criterion of longevity. [[Almagest]] (the Great System).
|-
| Aryabhatan model
| [[Aryabhata]] (499)
| Geocentric or Heliocentric
| The [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] and the planets move in [[elliptical orbit]]s around either the Earth or Sun; uncertain whether the model is geocentric or heliocentric due to planetary orbits given with respect to both the Earth and Sun.
|-
| Medieval universe
| [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] (500–1200)
| Finite in time
| A universe that is finite in time and has a beginning is proposed by the [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] [[John Philoponus]], who argues against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Logical arguments supporting a finite universe are developed by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]] [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Saadia Gaon]], and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]] [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]].

| Maragha models
| [[Maragheh observatory|Maragha school]] (1259–1528)
| Geocentric
| Various modifications to Ptolemaic model and Aristotelian universe, including rejection of [[equant]] and [[Deferent and epicycle|eccentrics]] at [[Maragheh observatory]], and introduction of [[Tusi-couple]] by [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Al-Tusi]]. Alternative models later proposed, including the first accurate [[Moon|lunar]] model by [[Ibn al-Shatir]], a model rejecting stationary Earth in favour of [[Earth's rotation]] by [[Ali Kuşçu]], and planetary model incorporating "circular [[inertia]]" by [[Al-Birjandi]].
|-
| Nilakanthan model

|-
|[[Giordano Bruno#Bruno.27s cosmology|Bruno's cosmology]]
| [[Giordano Bruno]] (1548–1600)
| Infinite extent, infinite time, homogeneous, isotropic, non-hierarchical
| Rejects the idea of a hierarchical universe. Earth and Sun have no special properties in comparison with the other heavenly bodies. The void between the stars is filled with [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], and matter is composed of the same [[Classical element|four elements]] (water, earth, fire, and air), and is atomistic, animistic and intelligent.
|-
|Keplerian
| [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630)
| Heliocentric with elliptical planetary orbits
| Kepler's discoveries, marrying mathematics and physics, provided the foundation for our present conception of the Solar system, but distant stars were still seen as objects in a thin, fixed celestial sphere.
|-
| Static Newtonian
| [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727)
| [[Static universe|Static]] (evolving), steady state, infinite
| Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle. Matter on the large scale is uniformly distributed. Gravitationally balanced but unstable.

| [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|Cartesian Vortex]] universe
| [[René Descartes]], 17th century
| Static (evolving), steady state, [[infinity|infinite]]
| System of huge swirling whirlpools of aethereal or fine matter produces what we would call gravitational effects. But his vacuum was not empty; all space was filled with matter.
|-
| Hierarchical universe
| [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Lambert]], 18th century
| Static (evolving), steady state, infinite
| Matter is clustered on ever larger scales of hierarchy. Matter is endlessly recycled.
|-
| [[Static universe|Einstein Universe with a cosmological constant]]
| [[Albert Einstein]], 1917
| Static (nominally). Bounded (finite)
| "Matter without motion". Contains uniformly distributed matter. Uniformly curved spherical space; based on [[Riemann sphere|Riemann's hypersphere]]. Curvature is set equal to Λ. In effect Λ is equivalent to a repulsive force which counteracts gravity. Unstable.

| [[De Sitter universe]]
| [[Willem de Sitter]], 1917
| [[Metric expansion of space|Expanding]] [[shape of the universe|flat space]].
Steady state.
Λ &gt; 0

| Expanding flat space
''k'' = 0 ; Λ = 0
Critical density
| Curvature constant ''k'' = 0. Said to be infinite (but ambiguous). "Unbounded cosmos of limited extent". Expands forever. "Simplest" of all known universes. Named after but not considered by Friedmann. Has a [[deceleration parameter|deceleration term]] ''q'' = 1/2, which means that its expansion rate slows down.
|-
| The original [[Big Bang]] (Friedmann-Lemaître)
| [[Georges Lemaître]] 1927–29
| Expansion
Λ &gt; 0 ; Λ &gt; |Gravity|
| Λ is positive and has a magnitude greater than gravity. Universe has initial high-density state ("primeval atom"). Followed by a two-stage expansion. Λ is used to destabilize the universe. (Lemaître is considered the father of the big bang model.)
|-
| [[Oscillating universe]] (Friedmann-Einstein)
| Favored by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]], 1920s
| Expanding and contracting in cycles
| Time is endless and beginningless; thus avoids the beginning-of-time paradox. Perpetual cycles of big bang followed by big crunch. (Einstein's first choice after he rejected his 1917 model.)

| [[Edward Arthur Milne|Edward Milne]], 1933, 1935;
[[William H. McCrea]], 1930s
| Kinematic expansion without space expansion
| Rejects general relativity and the expanding space paradigm. Gravity not included as initial assumption. Obeys cosmological principle and [[special relativity]]; consists of a finite spherical cloud of particles (or galaxies) that expands within an infinite and otherwise empty flat space. It has a center and a cosmic edge (surface of the particle cloud) that expands at light speed. Explanation of gravity was elaborate and unconvincing.
|-
| [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] class of models
| [[Howard Percy Robertson|Howard Robertson]], [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker|Arthur Walker]], 1935
| Uniformly expanding

|-
| Steady-state
| [[Fred Hoyle]] 1948
| Expanding, steady state; but unstable
| Matter creation rate maintains constant density. But since matter creation rate must be exactly balanced with the space expansion rate the system is unstable.
|-

| [[Hannes Alfvén]] 1965 [[Oskar Klein]]
| Cellular universe, expanding by means of matter–antimatter annihilation
| Based on the concept of [[plasma cosmology]]. The universe is viewed as "meta-galaxies" divided by [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]] and thus a bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic matter-[[antimatter]] [[annihilation]]s keep the bubbles separated and moving apart preventing them from interacting.
|-
| [[Brans–Dicke theory]]
| [[Carl H. Brans]], [[Robert H. Dicke]]

|-
| [[Cosmic inflation]]
| [[Alan Guth]] 1980
| [[Big Bang]] modified  to solve [[horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]]s
| Based on the concept of hot inflation. The universe is viewed as a multiple quantum flux – hence its bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic expansion kept the bubbles separated and moving apart.
|-
| [[Chaotic inflation theory|Eternal inflation]] (a multiple universe model)
| [[Andrei Linde|Andreï Linde]], 1983

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

== Etymology ==
The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
{{See also|debris ball|road debris}}

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)
| year=2003
| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

A '''double layer''' ('''DL''', also called an '''electrical double layer''', '''EDL''') is a structure that appears on the surface of an object when it is exposed to a fluid. The object might be a solid particle, a gas bubble, a liquid [[droplet]], or a [[porous media|porous body]]. The DL refers to two parallel layers of charge surrounding the object. The first layer, the [[surface charge]] (either positive or negative), consists of ions [[adsorbed]] onto the object due to chemical interactions.   The second layer is composed of ions attracted to the surface charge via the [[Coulomb force]], electrically [[Electric-field screening|screening]] the first layer. This second layer is loosely associated with the object. It is made of free ions that move in the fluid under the influence of [[Electromagnetism|electric attraction]] and [[thermal motion]] rather than being firmly anchored.  It is thus called the "diffuse layer".

[[Interface (chemistry)|Interfacial]] DLs are most apparent in systems with a large surface area to volume ratio, such as a [[colloid]] or porous bodies with particles or pores (respectively) on the scale of micrometres to nanometres. However, DLs are important to other phenomena, such as the [[electrochemical]] behaviour of [[electrode]]s.

DLs play a fundamental role in many everyday substances. For instance, homogenized milk exists only because fat droplets are covered with a DL that prevents their [[coagulation (milk)|coagulation]] into butter. DLs exist in practically all [[heterogeneous]] fluid-based systems, such as blood, paint, ink and ceramic and cement [[slurry]].

The DL is closely related to [[electrokinetic phenomena]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

== Development of the (interfacial) double layer ==

=== Helmholtz ===
[[File:EDLC-Potentialdistribution.png|thumb|right|200px|Simplified illustration of the potential development in the area and in the further course of a Helmholtz double layer.]]
When an ''electronic'' conductor is brought in contact with a solid or liquid ''ionic'' conductor (electrolyte), a common boundary ([[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]) among the two [[Phase (matter)|phases]] appears. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=H.|periodical=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|title=Ueber einige Gesetze der Vertheilung elektrischer Ströme in körperlichen Leitern mit Anwendung auf die thierisch-elektrischen Versuche |volume=165|issue=6|year=1853|pages=211–233|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18531650603|last1=Helmholtz|bibcode=1853AnP...165..211H}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to realize that [[Electric charge|charged]] electrodes immersed in electrolyte solutions repel the co-ions of the charge while attracting counterions to their surfaces. Two layers of opposite [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] form at the interface between electrode and electrolyte.
In 1853 he showed that an electrical double layer (DL) is essentially a [[molecule|molecular]] dielectric and stores charge electrostatically.&lt;ref name="EDL"&gt;{{cite web | title = The electrical double layer | year = 2011 | url = http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm | accessdate = 23 April 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110531014449/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Chemistry/Electrochemis/Electrochemical/ElectricalDouble/ElectricalDouble.htm | archivedate = 31 May 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Below the electrolyte's decomposition voltage, the stored charge is linearly dependent on the voltage applied.

This early model predicted a constant [[differential capacitance]] independent from the charge density depending on the [[dielectric constant]] of the electrolyte [[solvent]] and the thickness of the double-layer.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk"&gt;{{cite web |author= Adam Marcus Namisnyk |title= A survey of electrochemical supercapacitor technology |url= http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |accessdate= 2012-12-10 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141222044332/http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |archivedate= 2014-12-22 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;Srinivasan S. (2006) Fuel cells, from Fundamentals to Applications, Springer eBooks, {{ISBN|978-0-387-35402-6}}, [https://www.springer.com/chemistry/electrochemistry/book/978-0-387-25116-5 Chapter 2, Electrode/electrolyte interfaces: Structure and kinetics of charge transfer.] (769&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9780387251165-c2.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-351700-p52496949 Electrochemical double-layer capacitors using carbon nanotube electrode structures.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This model, with a good foundation for the description of the interface, does not consider important factors including diffusion/mixing of ions in solution, the possibility of [[adsorption]] onto the surface and the interaction between solvent [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moments]] and the electrode.

=== Gouy-Chapman ===
[[Louis Georges Gouy]] in 1910 and [[David Chapman (scientist)|David Leonard Chapman]] in 1913 both observed that capacitance was not a constant and that it depended on the applied potential and the ionic concentration. The "Gouy-Chapman model" made significant improvements by introducing a [[Diffusion|diffuse]] model of the DL. In this model the charge distribution of ions as a function of distance from the metal surface allows [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] to be applied. Thus the [[electric potential]] [[Exponential decay|decreases exponentially]] away from the surface of the fluid bulk.&lt;ref name="Namisnyk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Ehrenstein  | first = Gerald  | title = Surface charge  | year = 2001  | url = http://www.biophysics.org/Portals/1/PDFs/Education/ehrenstein.pdf  | accessdate = 30 May 2011  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928073500/http://www.biophysics.org/Portals/1/PDFs/Education/ehrenstein.pdf  | archive-date = 2011-09-28  | dead-url = yes  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stern ===
The Gouy-Chapman model fails for highly charged DLs. In 1924 [[Otto Stern]] suggested combining the Helmholtz model with the Gouy-Chapman model: In Stern's model, some ions adhere to the electrode as suggested by Helmholtz, giving an internal Stern layer, while some form a Gouy-Chapman diffuse layer.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, O. ''Z.Electrochem'', 30, 508 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stern layer accounts for ions' finite size and consequently an ion's closest approach to the electrode is on the order of the ionic radius. The Stern model has its own limitations, namely that it effectively treats ions as point charges, assumes all significant interactions in the [[diffuse layer]] are [[Coulomb]]ic,  and assumes [[dielectric permittivity]] to be constant throughout the double layer and that fluid viscosity is constant plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = SMIRNOV  | first = Gerald  | title = Electric Double Layer  | year = 2011| url = http://web.nmsu.edu/~snsm/classes/chem435/Lab14/double_layer.html   | accessdate = 23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grahame ===
[[File:Electric double-layer (BMD model) NT.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Schematic representation of a double layer on an electrode (BMD) model. 1. Inner Helmholtz plane, (IHP), 2. Outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), 3. Diffuse layer, 4. Solvated ions (cations) 5. Specifically adsorbed ions (redox ion, which contributes to the pseudocapacitance), 6. Molecules of the electrolyte solvent]]
D. C. Grahame modified the Stern model in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Grahame, Chem. Rev., 41 (1947) 441&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that some ionic or uncharged species can penetrate the Stern layer, although the closest approach to the electrode is normally occupied by solvent molecules. This could occur if ions lose their [[solvation shell]] as they approach the electrode. He called ions in direct contact with the electrode "specifically adsorbed ions". This model proposed the existence of three regions. The inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) passes through the centres of the specifically adsorbed ions. The outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) passes through the centres of solvated ions at the distance of their closest approach to the electrode.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nakamura et al., "Outer Helmholtz Plane of the Electrical Double Layer Formed at the Solid Electrode–Liquid Interface" ChemPhysChem, 12 (2011) 1430&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP.

=== Bockris/Devanathan/Müller (BDM) ===
In 1963 [[John Bockris|J. O'M. Bockris]], M. A. V. Devanathan and [[Klaus Müller (chemist)|Klaus Müller]]&lt;ref&gt;J. O'M. Bockris, M. A. V Devanathan, and K. Mueller, Proc. Roy. Soc, Ser. A. 274, 55 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the BDM model of the double-layer that included the action of the solvent in the interface. They suggested that the attached molecules of the solvent, such as water, would have a fixed alignment to the electrode surface. This first layer of solvent molecules displays a strong orientation to the electric field depending on the charge. This orientation has great influence on the [[permittivity]] of the solvent that varies with field strength. The IHP passes through the centers of these molecules. Specifically adsorbed, partially solvated ions appear in this layer. The solvated ions of the electrolyte are outside the IHP. Through the centers of these ions pass the OHP. The diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP.

=== Trasatti/Buzzanca ===
Further research with double layers on ruthenium dioxide films in 1971 by Sergio Trasatti and Giovanni Buzzanca demonstrated that the electrochemical behavior of these electrodes at low voltages with specific adsorbed ions was like that of capacitors. The specific adsorption of the ions in this region of potential could also involve a partial charge transfer between the ion and the electrode. It was the first step towards understanding pseudocapacitance.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan" /&gt;

=== Conway ===

Between 1975 and 1980 [[Brian Evans Conway]] conducted extensive fundamental and development work on [[ruthenium oxide]] electrochemical capacitors. In 1991 he described the difference between 'Supercapacitor' and 'Battery' behavior in electrochemical energy storage. In 1999 he coined the term supercapacitor to explain the increased capacitance by surface redox reactions with faradaic charge transfer between electrodes and ions.&lt;ref name="Conway Transition"&gt;{{citation|last1=Conway|first1=B.E.|periodical=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|title=Transition from 'Supercapacitor' to 'Battery' Behavior in Electrochemical Energy Storage |volume=138|issue=6|pages=1539–1548|date= May 1991|language=German|doi=10.1149/1.2085829}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.K.

His "supercapacitor" stored electrical charge partially in the Helmholtz double-layer and partially as the result of faradaic reactions with "pseudocapacitance" charge transfer of electrons and protons between electrode and electrolyte. The working mechanisms of pseudocapacitors are redox reactions, intercalation and electrosorption.

=== Marcus ===

The physical and mathematical basics of electron charge transfer absent chemical bonds leading to pseudocapacitance was developed by [[Rudolph A. Marcus]]. [[Marcus Theory]] explains the rates of electron transfer reactions—the rate at which an electron can move from one chemical species to another. It was originally formulated to address [[outer sphere electron transfer]] reactions, in which two chemical species change only in their charge, with an electron jumping. For redox reactions without making or breaking bonds, Marcus theory takes the place of [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]]'s [[transition state theory]] which was derived for reactions with structural changes. Marcus received the [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1992 for this theory.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1992/index.html Rudolph A.

[[File:DoubleLayer.gif|thumb|360px|detailed illustration of interfacial DL]]

As stated by Lyklema, "...the reason for the formation of a "relaxed" ("equilibrium") double layer is the non-electric affinity of charge-determining ions for a surface..."&lt;ref name="Lyklema"&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This process leads to the buildup of an [[electric surface charge]], expressed usually in C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This surface charge creates an electrostatic field that then affects the ions in the bulk of the liquid. This electrostatic field, in combination with the thermal motion of the ions, creates a counter charge, and thus screens the electric surface charge. The net electric charge in this screening diffuse layer is equal in magnitude to the net surface charge, but has the opposite polarity. As a result, the complete structure is electrically neutral.

The diffuse layer, or at least part of it, can move under the influence of [[tangential]] [[Stress (physics)|stress]]. There is a conventionally introduced slipping plane that separates mobile fluid from fluid that remains attached to the surface. Electric potential at this plane is called [[electrokinetic potential]] or [[zeta potential]] (also denoted as ζ-potential).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ian D.|last1=Morrison|first2=Sydney|last2=Ross|title=Colloidal dispersions : suspensions, emulsions, and foams|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-471-17625-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Jingkun|last2=Oberdörster|first2=Günter|last3=Biswas|first3=Pratim|title=Characterization of size, surface charge, and agglomeration state of nanoparticle dispersions for toxicological studies|journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research|date=25 June 2008|volume=11|issue=1|pages=77–89|doi=10.1007/s11051-008-9446-4|bibcode=2009JNR....11...77J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric potential on the external boundary of the Stern layer versus the bulk electrolyte is referred to as [[Stern potential]]. Electric potential difference between the fluid bulk and the surface is called the electric surface potential.

Usually [[zeta potential]] is used for estimating the degree of DL charge. A characteristic value of this electric potential in the DL is 25 mV with a maximum value around 100 mV (up to several volts on electrodes&lt;ref name=Kirby /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.S. Bogotsky, Fundamentals of Electrochemistry, Wiley-Interscience, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;). The chemical composition of the sample at which the ζ-potential is 0 is called the [[point of zero charge]] or the [[iso-electric point]]. It is usually determined by the solution pH value, since protons and hydroxyl ions are the charge-determining ions for most surfaces.&lt;ref name=Kirby /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyklema /&gt;

Zeta potential can be measured using [[electrophoresis]], [[electroacoustic phenomena]], [[streaming potential]], and [[electroosmotic flow]].

The characteristic thickness of the DL is the [[Debye length]], κ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is reciprocally proportional to the square root of the ion concentration ''C''. In aqueous solutions it is typically on the scale of a few nanometers and the thickness decreases with increasing concentration of the electrolyte.

The electric field strength inside the DL can be anywhere from zero to over 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;V/m. These steep electric potential gradients are the reason for the importance of the DLs.

The theory for a flat surface and a symmetrical electrolyte&lt;ref name="Lyklema" /&gt; is usually referred to as the Gouy-Chapman theory. It yields a simple relationship between electric charge in the diffuse layer σ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; and the Stern potential Ψ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D.A.H.| last2=Ghadiri| first2=M.

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma^d = -\sqrt{{8\varepsilon_0}{\varepsilon_m}CRT}\sinh \frac{F\Psi^d}{2RT}&lt;/math&gt;

There is no general analytical solution for mixed electrolytes, curved surfaces or even spherical particles. There is an asymptotic solution for spherical particles with low charged DLs. In the case when electric potential over DL is less than 25 mV, the so-called Debye-Huckel approximation holds. It yields the following expression for electric potential'' Ψ'' in the spherical DL as a function of the distance ''r'' from the particle center:

:&lt;math&gt; {\Psi}(r) = {\Psi^d}\frac{a}{r}\exp({-\kappa}(r-a))&lt;/math&gt;

There are several asymptotic models which play important roles in theoretical developments associated with the interfacial DL.

The first one is "thin DL". This model assumes that DL is much thinner than the colloidal particle or capillary radius. This restricts the value of the Debye length and particle radius as following:

:&lt;math&gt;     {\kappa}a &gt;&gt;1    &lt;/math&gt;

This model offers tremendous simplifications for many subsequent applications. Theory of [[electrophoresis]] is just one example.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Foundations of Colloid Science", Oxford University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[electroacoustic phenomena]] is another example.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |editor= |others= |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2002 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=33 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/psd/modeltheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thin DL model is valid for most aqueous systems because the Debye length is only a few nanometers in such cases. It breaks down only for nano-colloids in solution with ionic strengths close to water.

The opposing "thick DL" model assumes that the Debye length is larger than particle radius:

:&lt;math&gt;     {\kappa}a &lt;1    &lt;/math&gt;

This model can be useful for some nano-colloids and non-polar fluids, where the Debye length is much larger.

The last model introduces "overlapped DLs".&lt;ref name="Dukhin" /&gt; This is important in concentrated dispersions and emulsions when distances between particles become comparable with the Debye length.

== Electrical double layers ==
The '''electrical double layer''' ('''EDL''') is the result of the variation of [[electric potential]] near a surface, and has a significant influence on the behaviour of [[colloid]]s and other surfaces in contact with [[solution]]s or solid-state [[fast ion conductor]]s. 

The primary difference between a double layer on an electrode and one on an interface is the mechanisms of [[surface charge]] formation. With an electrode, it is possible to regulate the surface charge by applying an external electric potential. This application, however, is impossible in colloidal and porous double layers, because for colloidal particles, one does not have access to the interior of the particle to apply a potential difference.

EDLs are analogous to the [[double layer (plasma)|double layer]] in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. 

=== Differential capacitance ===
{{Main article|Differential capacitance}}
EDLs have an additional parameter defining their characterization: [[differential capacitance]]. Differential capacitance, denoted as ''C'', is described by the equation below:

:&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{d \sigma}{ d \Psi}&lt;/math&gt;

where σ is the [[surface charge]] and ψ is the [[electric surface potential]].

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==

In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M.

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull.

==Natural greenhouse effect==

{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

Energy resources bring with them great social and economic promise, providing financial growth for communities and energy services for local economies. However, the infrastructure which delivers energy services can break down in an '''energy accident''', sometimes causing much damage, and '''energy fatalities''' can occur, and with many systems often deaths will happen even when the systems are working as intended.

Historically, [[coal mining]] has been the most dangerous energy activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[Mining accident|mining disasters]] is a long one. [[Underground mining]] hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and [[gas]] explosions. [[Open cut mining]] hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners have been killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125676950 "Former Miner Explains Culture Of Mining.]" NPR: National Public Radio. April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Mine/story?id=1475697 Coal Mining Steeped in History]". ABC News. January 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], 279 ''major'' energy accidents occurred from 1907 to 2007 and they caused 182,156 deaths with $41 billion in property damages, with these figures not including deaths from smaller accidents.&lt;ref name=bksenpol&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' 36 (2008), pp. 1802–1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by far the greatest energy fatalities that result from energy generation by humanity, is the creation of [[air pollution]]. The most lethal of which, [[particulate matter]], which is primarily generated from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is (counting outdoor air pollution effects only) estimated to cause 2.1 million deaths annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceref.com/earth/fine-particulate-matter-map-shows-premature-mortality-due-to-air-polution.html |title=

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], while responsible for less than 1 percent of the total number of energy accidents, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] facilities claimed 94 percent of reported immediate fatalities. Results on immediate fatalities are dominated by one disaster in which  Typhoon Nina in 1975 washed out the [[Shimantan Dam]] (Henan Province, China) and 171,000 people perished.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; While the other major accident that involved greater than 1000 immediate deaths followed the rupture of the [[1998 Jesse pipeline explosion|NNPC petroleum pipeline]] in 1998 and the resulting explosion.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; The other singular accident described by Sovacool is the ''predicted'' latent death toll of greater than 1000, as a result of the 1986 [[steam explosion]] at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear reactor]] in the Ukraine. With approximately 4000 deaths in total, to eventually result in the decades ahead due to the [[radio-isotope]] pollution released.

In the oil and gas industry, the need for improved [[safety culture]] and training within companies is evidenced by the finding that workers new to a company are more likely to be involved in fatalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Coal mining accidents resulted in 5,938 immediate deaths in 2005, and 4746 immediate deaths in 2006 in China alone according to the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pozon|first=Ina|author2=Puanani Mench|title=Coming Clean: The future of coal in the Asia-Pacific region|journal=WWF|year=2006|url=http://wwf.panda.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=112520|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining is the most dangerous occupation in China, the death rate for every 100 tons of coal mined is 100 times that of the death rate in the US and 30 times that achieved in South Africa. Moreover, 600,000 Chinese coal miners, as of 2004, were suffering from [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis]] (known as "black lung") a disease of the lungs caused by long-continued inhalation of coal dust. And the figure increases by 70,000 miners every year in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/13/content_391242.htm|title= Coal mining: Most deadly job in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[mining disasters]] is a long one. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"/&gt; In the decades following this peak, an annual death toll of 1,500 miner fatalities occurred every year in the US until approximately the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT2.HTM|title= Injury Trends in Mining }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining fatalities in the US between 1990 and 2012 have continued to decline, with fewer than 100 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT10.HTM|title= Mine Safety and Health at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See more [[Coal mining disasters in the United States]])

In the United States, in the 2000s, after three decades of regulation on the [[Environmental impact of the coal industry]], including regulations in the 1970s and 1990s from the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], an act created to cut down on pollution related deaths from fossil fuel usage, US [[coal]] fired power plants were estimated, in the 2000s, to continue to cause between 10,000 and 30,000 latent, or air pollution related deaths per year, due to the emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and directly emitted [[particulate matter]] that result when coal is burnt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/rpp/RFF-DP-12-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2012, urban outdoor air pollution, from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is estimated to cause 3 million deaths worldwide per year and indoor air pollution from biomass and fossil fuel burning is estimated to cause approximately 4.3 million premature deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Air quality and health}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a team of researchers estimated the number of premature deaths caused by particulate matter in outdoor air pollution as 2.1 million, occurring annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt;

==Economic costs==
Benjamin Sovacool says that while hydroelectric plants were responsible for the most fatalities,{{Contradict-inline|reason=The table in the Fatalities section above attributes a far higher number of fatalities to fossil fuels|date=June 2017}} [[nuclear power]] plants rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; Excluding Chernobyl and the Shimantan Dam, the three other most expensive accidents involved the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] (Alaska), The [[Prestige oil spill]] (Spain), and the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]] (Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; However analysis presented in the international Journal, ''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' found that coal, oil, [[Liquid petroleum gas]] and hydro accidents have cost more than nuclear power accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10807030802387556|title=A Comparative Analysis of Accident Risks in Fossil, Hydro, and Nuclear Energy Chains|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: an International Journal|volume=14|issue=5|pages=947|year=2008|last1=Burgherr|first1=Peter|last2=Hirschberg|first2=Stefan}} See also [http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/_2012_LEA_Audit/TA01.pdf], p. 968 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy customer switching''' is a concept stemming from the [[Energy market|global energy markets]]. The concept refers to the action of one energy customer [[customer switching|switching]] [[energy supplier]], a switch is essentially seen as the free (by choice) movement of a customer. In addition to that a switch can include:

* A re-switch: When a customer switches for the second or subsequent time. 
* A switch-back: When a customer switches back to his/her former or previous supplier.

If a customer moves, there is often a switch, however this will only be counted if the customer is not dealing with the incumbent in the new area of residence.

The above is the official definition of switching and is being used by public energy institutions such as [[CEER]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceer.eu|title=Welcome - ceer.eu|website=www.ceer.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[ERGEG]] (forerunner to ACER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acer.europa.eu/Pages/ACER.aspx|title=Home|website=www.acer.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The definition was originally developed by Dr Philip E. Lewis, international switching expert.

Switching is a key concept to understanding [[competition (economics)|competition]]-related issues on the global energy markets as the switching level of a concrete market reveals the state of the competition; High switching rates equals high level of competition and low switching rates equals limited competition. Thus measuring and assessing switching rates is necessary in order to have a correct impression of the energy markets. The action of switching is often done via a [[price comparison website]] or by the traditional [[door-to-door]] sales method, where a salesperson assists the customer in switching.

'''Energy density''' is the amount of [[energy]] stored in a given system or region of space per unit [[volume]]. Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit [[mass]], though the accurate term for this is [[specific energy]].  Often only the ''useful'' or extractable energy is measured, which is to say that inaccessible energy (such as [[rest mass]] energy) is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html |title=The Two Classes of SI Units and the SI Prefixes |work=NIST Guide to the SI |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] and other [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contexts, however, the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the [[stress–energy tensor]] and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph.

Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as [[pressure]], and in many circumstances is a [[synonym]]: for example, the energy density of a magnetic field may be expressed as (and behaves as) a physical pressure, and the energy required to compress a compressed gas a little more may be determined by multiplying the difference between the gas pressure and the external pressure by the change in volume. In short, pressure is a measure of the [[enthalpy]] per unit volume of a system. A pressure gradient has the potential to perform work on the surroundings by converting enthalpy to work until equilibrium is reached.

==Introduction to energy density==
&lt;!-- This section in intended for learners, and therefore covers only common materials, and omits excessive detail --&gt;

There are many different types of energy stored in materials, and it takes a particular type of reaction to release each type of energy. In order of the typical magnitude of the energy released, these types of reactions are: nuclear, chemical, electrochemical, and electrical.

[[Nuclear reaction]]s are used by stars and nuclear power plants, both of which derive energy from the binding energy of nuclei. [[Chemical reaction]]s are used by animals to derive energy from food, and by automobiles to derive energy from gasoline. Liquid hydrocarbons (fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerozene) are today the most dense way known to economically store and  transport chemical energy at a very large scale (1 kg of diesel fuel burns with the oxygen contained in ~15 kg of air). [[Electrochemical reaction]]s are used by most mobile devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones to release the energy from batteries.

===Energy densities of common energy storage materials===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!-- STOP!!! This section is for a basic overview comparison of common energy storage materials. Before adding any items, first ask yourself: Is this material used on a large scale to produce energy, or is it commonly discussed in everyday journalism? If so, go ahead and add it! --&gt;

The following is a list of the thermal energy densities (that is to say: the amount of heat energy that can be extracted) of commonly used or well-known energy storage materials; it doesn't include uncommon or experimental materials. Note that this list does not consider the mass of reactants commonly available such as the oxygen required for combustion or the energy efficiency in use. An extended version of this table is found at [[Energy density#Extended Reference Table]]. Major reference = &lt;ref name="engineeringtoolbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fossil-fuels-energy-content-d_1298.html |title=Fossil and Alternative Fuels - Energy Content (2008).  |publisher=Engineering ToolBox |accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The following unit conversions may be helpful when considering the data in the table: 3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|MJ]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] ≈ 1.34&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower-hour|HPh]].

==Energy density in energy storage and in fuel==
[[File:Energy density.svg|thumb|400px|Selected energy densities plot&lt;ref name=tzar1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar8 /&gt;]]

In [[energy storage]] applications the energy density relates the [[mass]] of an energy store to the volume of the storage facility, e.g. the [[fuel]] tank. The higher the energy density of the fuel, the more energy may be stored or transported for the same amount of volume. The energy density of a fuel per unit mass is called the [[specific energy]] of that fuel. In general an [[engine]] using that fuel will generate less [[kinetic energy]] due to [[inefficiency|inefficiencies]] and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] considerations—hence the [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] of an engine will always be greater than its rate of production of the kinetic energy of motion.

===Nuclear energy sources===&lt;!--esoterica to most readers--&gt;
The greatest energy source by far is mass itself.  This energy, ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m = ρV'', ''ρ'' is the mass per unit volume, ''V'' is the volume of the mass itself and ''c'' is the speed of light.  This energy, however, can be released only by the processes of [[nuclear fission]] (0.1%), [[nuclear fusion]] (1%), or the annihilation of some or all of the matter in the volume ''V'' by matter-[[antimatter]] collisions (100%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Nuclear reactions cannot be realized by chemical reactions such as combustion.  Although greater matter densities can be achieved, the density of a [[neutron star]] would approximate the most dense system capable of matter-antimatter annihilation possible.  A [[black hole]], although denser than a neutron star, does not have an equivalent anti-particle form, but would offer the same 100% conversion rate of mass to energy in the form of Hawking radiation. In the case of relatively small black holes (smaller than astronomical objects) the power output would be tremendous.

The highest density sources of energy aside from antimatter are [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. Fusion includes energy from the sun which will be available for billions of years (in the form of sunlight) but so far (2018), sustained [[fusion power]] production continues to be elusive. 

Power from fission of uranium and thorium in [[nuclear power]] plants will be available for many decades or even centuries because of the plentiful supply of the elements on earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Uranium-Resources/Supply-of-Uranium/ |title=Supply of Uranium |publisher=world-nuclear.org |date=2014-10-08 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the full potential of this source can only be realised through [[breeder reactor]]s, which are, apart from the [[BN-600 reactor]], not yet used commercially.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts from Cohen |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]], [[gas]], and [[petroleum]] are the current primary energy sources in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506022627/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archivedate=2010-05-06 |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Annual Energy Review |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have a much lower energy density. Burning local [[biomass]] fuels supplies household energy needs ([[Biomass Cook Stoves|cooking fires]], [[oil lamp]]s, etc.) worldwide. 

====Thermal power of nuclear fission reactors====
The density of thermal energy contained in the core of a [[light water reactor]] ([[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or [[Boiling water reactor|BWR]]) of typically 1 GWe (1 000 MW electrical corresponding to ~3 000 MW thermal) is in the range of 10 to 100 MW of thermal energy per cubic meter of cooling water depending on the location considered in the system (the core itself (~30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the reactor pressure vessel (~50 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or the whole primary circuit (~300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)). This represents a considerable density of energy which requires under all circumstances a continuous water flow at high velocity in order to be able to remove the [[heat]] from the core, even after an emergency shutdown of the reactor. The incapacity to cool the cores of three [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] in 2011 after the [[tsunami]] and the resulting loss of the external electrical power and of the cold source was the cause of the meltdown of the three cores in only a few hours. Meanwhile, the three reactors were correctly shut down just after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]]. This extremely high power density distinguishes nuclear power plants (NPP's) from any thermal power plants (burning coal, fuel or gas) or any chemical plants and explains the large redundancy required to permanently control the [[Nuclear chain reaction|neutron reactivity]] and to remove the residual heat from the core of NPP's.

===Broad implications===
Energy density differs from [[energy conversion efficiency]] (net output per input) or [[embodied energy]] (the energy output costs to provide, as [[energy industry|harvesting]], [[Oil refinery|refining]], distributing, and dealing with [[pollution]] all use energy). Large scale, intensive energy use impacts and is impacted by [[climate]], [[nuclear waste|waste storage]], and [[deforestation|environmental consequences]].

No single energy storage method boasts the best in [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], [[specific energy]], and energy density. [[Peukert's Law]] describes how the amount of useful energy that can be obtained (for a lead-acid cell) depends on how quickly we pull it out.  To maximize both specific energy and energy density, one can compute the [[specific energy|specific energy density]] of a substance by multiplying the two values together, where the higher the number, the better the substance is at storing energy efficiently.

Alternative options are discussed for energy storage to increase energy density and decrease charging time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu-Zanetti|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Nanogap capacitors: Sensitivity to sample permittivity changes|date=2005|volume=99|issue=2|doi=10.1063/1.2161818|bibcode=2006JAP....99b4305I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoi|first1=K.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=New generation "nanohybrid supercapacitor".|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=2013|doi=10.1021/ar200308h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Osuagwu|first2=O.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|date=2010|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=D.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=: IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gravimetric]] and [[volumetric]] energy density of some fuels and storage technologies (modified from the [[Gasoline]] article):
:Note: Some values may not be precise because of [[isomers]] or other irregularities.  See [[Heating value]] for a comprehensive table of specific energies of important fuels.
:Note: Also it is important to realise that generally the density values for chemical fuels do not include the weight of oxygen required for combustion. This is typically two oxygen atoms per carbon atom, and one per two hydrogen atoms. The [[atomic weight]] of carbon and oxygen are similar, while hydrogen is much lighter than oxygen. Figures are presented this way for those fuels where in practice air would only be drawn in locally to the burner. This explains the apparently lower energy density of materials that already include their own oxidiser (such as gunpowder and TNT), where the mass of the oxidiser in effect adds dead weight, and absorbs some of the energy of combustion to dissociate and liberate oxygen to continue the reaction. This also explains some apparent anomalies, such as the energy density of a sandwich appearing to be higher than that of a stick of dynamite.

===Energy densities ignoring external components===
This table lists energy densities of systems that require external components, such as oxidisers or a heat sink or source. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of the required components as they are assumed to be freely available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems cannot be compared with self-contained systems. These values may not be computed at the same reference conditions.
&lt;!-- To ensure this table sorts correctly: avoid using "-" or unicode dash in columns with numbers; ensure each row has a single numeric value, use data-sort-value="0" |  if unknown; do not use ? or {{?}}; do not use "A to B", nor "C (approximately)"; provide a cite for each value. Test changes on several browsers as sort behaviour may vary. --&gt;

==Energy density of electric and magnetic fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Special relativity]] --&gt;
[[Electric field|Electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s store energy.  In a vacuum, the (volumetric) energy density is given by

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \mathbf{B}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The solution will be (in SI units) in Joules per cubic metre. In the context of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the physics of conductive fluids, the magnetic energy density behaves like an additional [[pressure]] that adds to the [[kinetic theory of gas|gas pressure]] of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

In normal (linear and nondispersive) substances, the energy density (in SI units) is

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{1}{2} ( \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{B} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]] and '''H''' is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetizing field]].

In the case of absence of magnetic fields, by exploting [[Herbert Fröhlich|Fröhlich's relationships]] it is also possible to extend these equations to [[anisotropic|anisotropy]] and [[nonlinear|nonlinearity]] dielectrics, as well as to calculate the correlated [[Helmholtz free energy]] and [[entropy]] densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parravicini | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.physb.2018.04.029 | title = Thermodynamic potentials in anisotropic and nonlinear dielectrics | journal = Physica B | volume = 541 | pages = 54-60 | year = 2018 | bibcode = 2018PhyB..541...54P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''energy flow''', also called the '''calorific flow''', refers to the flow of [[energy]] through a [[food chain]], and is the focus of study in '''ecological energetics'''. In an [[ecosystem]], [[ecologist]]s seek to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the relative importance of different component [[species]] and feeding relationships.

A general energy flow scenario follows:
*[[Solar energy]] is fixed by the [[photoautotroph]]s, called primary producers, like green [[plant]]s. [[Primary consumers]] absorb most of the stored energy in the plant through [[digestion]], and transform it into the form of energy they need, such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), through [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. A part of the energy received by primary consumers, [[herbivore]]s, is converted to [[thermoregulation|body heat]] (an effect of respiration), which is [[radiant energy|radiated]] away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in [[warm-blooded]] animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of [[digestion|undigested]] food (egesta) by [[excrement|excretion]] or [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].
*Secondary consumers, [[carnivore]]s, then consume the primary consumers, although [[omnivore]]s also consume primary producers. Energy that had been used by the primary consumers for growth and storage is thus absorbed into the secondary consumers through the process of digestion. As with primary consumers, secondary consumers convert this energy into a more suitable form (ATP) during respiration. Again, some energy is lost from the system, since energy which the primary consumers had used for respiration and regulation of body temperature cannot be utilized by the secondary consumers.
*Tertiary consumers, which may or may not be [[apex predator]]s, then consume the secondary consumers, with some energy passed on and some lost, as with the lower levels of the food chain.
*A final link in the food chain are [[decomposer]]s which break down the [[organic matter]] of the tertiary consumers (or whichever consumer is at the top of the chain) and release [[nutrient]]s into the [[soil]]. They also break down plants, herbivores and carnivores that were not eaten by organisms higher on the food chain, as well as the undigested food that is excreted by herbivores and carnivores. [[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are decomposers, and play a pivotal role in the [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[carbon cycle]]s.

The energy is passed on from [[trophic level]] to trophic level and each time about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the environment (an effect of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta). Therefore, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a [[food chain]] receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels. This loss of energy at each level limits typical food chains to only four to six links.

== History of ecological energetics ==
Ecological energetics appears to have grown out of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concerns of the [[Physiocrats]]. It began in the works of [[Sergei Podolinsky]] in the late 1800s, and subsequently was developed by the Soviet ecologist [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]], the Austro-American [[Alfred J. Lotka]], and American limnologists, [[Raymond Lindeman]] and [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]. It underwent substantial development by [[Howard T. Odum]] and was applied by [[systems ecology|systems ecologists]], and [[radiation ecology|radiation ecologists]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], [[energy]] is defined in terms of the '''energy operator''', acting on the [[wave function]] of the system as a consequence of [[time translation symmetry]].

==Definition==

It is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Mechanics Demystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{E} = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

It acts on the wave function (the [[probability amplitude]] for different [[Configuration space (physics)|configurations]] of the system)

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==

The energy operator [[correspondence principle|corresponds]] to the full energy of a system. The [[Schrödinger equation]] describes the space- and time-dependence of the slow changing (non-[[theory of relativity|relativistic]]) wave function of a quantum system. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]].

===Schrödinger equation===
Using the energy operator to the [[Schrödinger equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; \hat{E}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] [[operator (physics)|operator]].

In a [[stationary state]] additionally occurs the time-independent [[Schrödinger equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; E \Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is an [[eigenvalue]] of energy.
===Klein–Gordon equation===

The [[Mass in special relativity#The relativistic energy-momentum equation|relativistic mass-energy relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where again ''E'' = total energy, ''p'' = total 3-[[momentum]] of the particle, ''m'' = [[invariant mass]], and ''c'' = [[speed of light]], can similarly yield the [[Klein–Gordon equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; \hat{E}^2 = c^2\hat{p}^2 + (mc^2)^2 \\
&amp; \hat{E}^2\Psi = c^2\hat{p}^2\Psi + (mc^2)^2\Psi \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} =  c^2\nabla^2\Psi - \left(\frac{mc^2}{\hbar}\right)^2\Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation==

The energy operator is easily derived from using the [[free particle]] wave function ([[plane wave]] solution to Schrödinger's equation).&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-471-87373-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in one dimension the wave function is

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = e^{i(kx-\omega t)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of ''Ψ'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -i \omega e^{i(kx-\omega t)} = - i \omega \Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[De Broglie relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; E=\hbar \omega \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - i \frac{E}{\hbar} \Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Re-arranging the equation leads to

:&lt;math&gt; E\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;,

where the energy factor ''E'' is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value, the energy the particle has and the value that is measured. The [[partial derivative]] is a [[linear operator]] so this expression ''is'' the operator for energy:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{E} = i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be concluded that the scalar ''E'' is the [[eigenvalue]] of the operator, while &lt;math&gt; \hat{E} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the operator. Summarizing these results:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{E}\Psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\Psi=E\Psi \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For a 3-d plane wave

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi = e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

the derivation is exactly identical, as no change is made to the term including time and therefore the time derivative. Since the [[linear operator|operator is linear]], they are valid for any [[linear combination]] of plane waves, and so they can act on any wave function without affecting the properties of the wave function or operators. Hence this must be true for any wave function. It turns out to work even in [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], such as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] above.

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tour and critical reception ==
[[File:Seoul-youth-hub-mandala-lydon-kang.jpg|alt=Artists and filmmakers, Patrick M.

Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">A '''Gold universe''' is a [[cosmology|cosmological]] model of the [[universe]].  In these models, the universe starts with a [[Big Bang]] and expands for some time, with increasing [[entropy]] and a  [[thermodynamic]] [[arrow of time]] pointing in the direction of the expansion.  After the universe reaches a low-density state, it recontracts, but entropy now decreases, pointing the thermodynamic arrow of time in the opposite direction, until the universe ends in a low-entropy, high-density [[Big Crunch]]. 
There are two models of the universe which support the possibility of a reversed direction of time. The first begins with a state of low entropy at the Big Bang which continually increases until the Big Crunch. The second, a Gold Universe, posits that entropy will increase only until a moment of contraction, then gradually decrease. This latter model suggests the universe will become more orderly after the moment of contraction. The Gold model has been linked to the possibility of retrocausal change, questions concerning the preservation of information in a time-reversed universe (states of decreasing entropy), and [[Causality (physics)|causation]] in general.  The Gold Universe is named after the cosmologist [[Thomas Gold]], who proposed the model in the 1960s.

This '''timeline of the Big Bang''' shows a sequence of events as currently theorized by scientists. 

It is a [[logarithmic scale]] that shows &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; ''second'' instead of ''second''. For example, one microsecond is &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10} 0.000 001 = 10 \cdot (-6) = -60&lt;/math&gt;. To convert −30 read on the scale to second calculate &lt;math&gt;10^{-\frac{30}{10}} = 10^{-3} = 0.001&lt;/math&gt; second = one millisecond. On a logarithmic time scale a step lasts ten times longer than the previous step.

{{duplication}}&lt;!--what is the point of keeping two timelines with exactly the same scope, one "graphical" and the other in html table format?--&gt;
This more than 20-billion-year '''timeline of our universe''' shows the best estimates of major events from the universe's beginning to anticipated future events. Zero on the scale is the present day. A large step on the scale is one billion years; a small step, one hundred million years. The past is denoted by a minus sign: e.g., the oldest rock on Earth was formed about four billion years ago and this is marked at -4e+09 years, where 4e+09 represents 4 times 10 to the power of 9. The "[[Big Bang]]" event most likely happened 13.8 billion years ago; see [[age of the universe]].

'''Intelligent Energy''' is a fuel cell engineering company focused on the development and commercialisation of its PEM fuel cell technologies for a range of markets including automotive, stationary power and UAVs. We are headquartered in the UK, with offices and representation in the US, Japan, India, and China.

== History ==

The origins of Intelligent Energy began at [[Loughborough University]] in the UK during the late 1980s, when the University became one of Europe’s first research and development centres for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology. In 1995, the UK’s first kW-level PEM fuel cell stack was produced by the R&amp;D team.  In June of that year, Advanced Power Sources (APS) Ltd was founded as a spin-out from Loughborough University by Paul Adcock, Phil Mitchell, Jon Moore and Anthony Newbold, and was the first company in the UK formed specifically to address the development and commercialisation of PEM fuel cells.

Founded by Harry Bradbury, Intelligent Energy was established in 2001, acquiring Advanced Power Sources Ltd, together with its personnel and fuel cell related intellectual property that originated from research conducted by both APS and Loughborough University into PEM fuel cell technology. This triggered investment and enabled the company to grow its business activities.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.cleantechinvestor.com/portal/mainmenucomp/companiesi/586-intelligent-energy-/11138-profile-intelligent-energy-published-in-cleantech-infocus-uk-innovation-in-fuel-cells-and-hydrogen.html Profile: Intelligent Energy - October 2012]. ''Cleantech Investor''. October 2012. Retrieved 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2005, it launched the [[ENV]], the world’s first purpose-built fuel cell motorbike which gained the company recognition as a Technology Pioneer by the [[World Economic Forum]] in 2006. The ENV incorporated the company’s air-cooled fuel cell technology hybridised with a battery pack to provide 6&amp;nbsp;kW peak load to the motor to improve performance during spikes in power demand i.e. acceleration.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2005/03/intelligent_ene.html Intelligent Energy’s ENV Fuel Cell Motorcycle].

Intelligent Energy was acquired by Meditor Energy, part of the Meditor Group, in October 2017.

== Technology ==

Intelligent Energy's fuel-cell technology is divided into two platforms: air-cooled (AC) and evaporatively-cooled (EC). The air-cooled fuel cell systems use low-power fans to provide cooling and the oxidant supply for operation. Heat from the fuel cell stack is conducted to cooling plates and removed through airflow channels,  a simplified and cost-effective system for the power range from a few watts to several kilowatts. They  are used in a wide range of UAV, stationary power and automotive applications for two-wheel and small car range extender applications.

Evaporatively-cooled (EC) fuel cell systems provide power generation from a few kilowatts up to 200&amp;nbsp;kW. Efficient thermal management of the EC fuel cell stack reduces system complexity, mass and cost. These  systems are designed for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, and use modular architecture that can be quickly modified to suit the application.

== Market sectors ==

=== Automotive ===

The firm's fuel cell stacks have been developed for  small and large cars, scooters and motorbikes. 
In 2010, the company was involved in the development of the report entitled “A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis. The role of Battery Electric Vehicles, Plug-In Hybrids and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles”, produced by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] with input from car manufacturers, oil and gas suppliers, utilities and industrial gas companies, wind turbine and electrolyser companies as well as governmental and non-governmental organisations. The report concluded, amongst other findings, that fuel cell vehicles are technology ready, and cost competitive, and that decarbonisation targets for Europe are unlikely to be met without the introduction of fuel cell powertrains.&lt;ref name="n"&gt;[http://www.fch-ju.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Power_trains_for_Europe.pdf/ A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis]. ''Fuel Cells and Hydrogen''. 9 November 2010. Retrieved 19 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UAVs ===

The firm provides fuel cells to power UAVs and aerial drones. Its UAV Fuel Cell Modules run on hydrogen and ambient air to produce DC power in a lightweight package providing extended flight times when compared to battery systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">In the [[outline of physical science|physical sciences]], an '''interface''' is the boundary between two spatial regions occupied by different matter, or by matter in different physical states. The interface between matter and air, or matter and vacuum, is called a '''surface''', and studied in [[surface science]]. In [[thermal equilibrium]], the regions in contact are called [[phase (matter)|phases]], and the interface is called a [[phase boundary]]. An example for an interface out of equilibrium is the [[grain boundary]] in polycrystalline matter.

The importance of the interface depends on the type of system: the bigger the quotient area/volume, the greater the effect the interface will have. Consequently, interfaces are very important in systems with large interface area-to-volume ratios, such as [[colloid]]s.

Interfaces can be flat or curved. For example, [[oil]] droplets  in a [[salad dressing]] are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of water is mostly flat.

[[Surface tension]] is the physical property which rules interface processes involving liquids. For a liquid film on flat surfaces, the liquid-vapor interface keeps flat to minimize interfacial area and system [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. For a liquid film on rough surfaces, the [[surface tension]] tends to keep the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] flat, while the [[disjoining pressure]] makes the film conformal to the substrate. The equilibrium meniscus shape is a result of the competition between the [[capillary pressure]] and [[disjoining pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5037066 Han Hu, Christopher R. Weinberger, and Ying Sun ''[[Nano Lett.]]'', 14 (12), pp 7131–7137 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaces may cause various [[optical phenomena]], such as [[refraction]].  [[Lens (optics)|Optical lenses]] serve as an example of a practical application of the interface between [[glass]] and air.

One topical interface system is the gas-liquid interface between [[aerosols]] and other atmospheric molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">The '''ion vibration current''' ('''IVI''') and the associated '''ion vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.

Historically, the IVI was the first known [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic phenomenon]]. It was predicted by [[Peter Debye]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Debye, P. |title=A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions |journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=1 |page=13 |year=1933 |doi=10.1063/1.1749213|bibcode=1933JChPh...1...13D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[sound wave]] travels through a solvent, the associated pressure gradients push the fluid particles back and forth, and it is easy in practice to create such accelerations that measure thousands or millions of [[g-force|g's]]. If a solute molecule is more dense or less dense than the surrounding liquid, then in this accelerating environment, the molecule will move relative to the surrounding liquid. This relative motion is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs in a [[centrifuge]], or more simply, it is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs when low-density objects float to the top of a glass of water, and high-density particles sink to the bottom (see the [[equivalence principle]], which states that gravity is just like any other acceleration). The amount of relative motion depends on the balance between the molecule's effective mass (which includes both the mass of the molecule itself and any solvent molecules that are so tightly bound to the molecule that they follow along with the molecule's motion), its effective volume (related to [[buoyant force]]), and the viscous drag (friction) between the molecule and the surrounding fluid.

IVI concerns the case where the particles in question are [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s. In general, they will have different amounts of motion relative to the fluid during the sound wave oscillations, and that discrepancy creates an alternating [[electric potential]] between various points in a [[sound wave]].

This effect was extensively used in the 1950s and 1960s for characterizing ion [[solvation]]. These works are mostly associated with the names of Zana and Yaeger, who published a review of their studies in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=Zana, R. and Yeager, E. |title=Ultrasonic Vibration Potentials |journal=Mod.

[[Image:Samuel Clarke.jpg|thumb|Samuel Clarke.]]
The '''Leibniz–Clarke correspondence''' was a [[scientific]], [[theological]] and [[philosophical]] [[debate]] conducted in an exchange of letters between the [[Germany|German]] thinker [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], an [[England|English]] supporter of [[Isaac Newton]] during the years 1715 and 1716.  The exchange began because of a letter Leibniz wrote to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], in which he remarked that Newtonian physics was detrimental to [[natural theology]].  Eager to defend the Newtonian view, Clarke responded, and the correspondence continued until the death of Leibniz in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a variety of subjects is touched on in the letters, the main interest for modern readers is in the dispute between the [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] theory of [[space]] favoured by Newton and Clarke, and Leibniz's [[Relational space|relational]] approach.  Also important is the conflict between Clarke's and Leibniz's opinions on [[free will]] and whether God must create the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz had published only a book on moral matters, the ''[[Theodicy|Theodicée]]'' (1710), and his more metaphysical views had never been exposed to a sufficient extent, so the collected letters were met with interest by their contemporaries. The priority dispute between [[Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy|Leibniz and Newton about the calculus]] was still fresh in the public's mind and it was taken as a matter of course that it was Newton himself who stood behind Clarke's replies.

==Editions==
The Leibniz-Clarke letters were first published under Clarke's name in the year following Leibniz' death.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Papers, which passed between the late Learned Mr. Leibniz, and Dr. Clarke, In the Years 1715 and 1716'', by Samuel Clarke D.D. (London:  James Knapton, 1717)&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a preface, took care of the translation from French, added notes and some of his own writing. In 1720 [[Pierre Desmaizeaux]] published a similar volume in a French translation,&lt;ref&gt;''Recueil de pièces diverses sur la philosophie la religion et l'histoire par Leibniz, Clarke et Newton'', publiées par Pierre Desmaizeaux, Amsterdam, 1720&lt;/ref&gt; including quotes from Newton's work. It is quite certain that for both editions the opinion of Newton himself has been sought and Leibniz left at a disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoloni-Melli D., ''Newton and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'',  The Cambridge Companion to Newton,   eds. I. B. Cohen and G. E. Smith, Cambridge University Press,  2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the German translation of the correspondence published by Kohler, also in 1720,&lt;ref&gt;''Merckwurdige Schriften welche . . . zwischen dem Herrn Baron von Leibniz und dem Herrn D. Clarke über besondere Materien der naturlichen Religion'' in Franzos. und Englischer Sprache gewechselt und . . . in teutscher Sprache herausgegeben worden von Heinrich Kohler, Frankfurt and Leipzig (Jena), 1720: there was a preface by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and a reply to Clarke's last letter in  behalf of Leibniz by Ludwig Philipp Thümmig; it appeared also in the latin translation from 1740.&lt;/ref&gt; contained a reply to Clarke's last letter which Leibniz had not been able to answer. The letters have been reprinted in most collections of Leibniz' works and regularly published in stand alone editions.&lt;ref&gt;A full list is given in Alexander H., ''The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence'',  with extracts from Newton's ''Principia'' and ''Opticks'', edited with an introduction and notes, Manchester, 1955 (and reeditions); for a more recent edition see e.g.

Knowledge of the '''location of Earth''' has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations, and has expanded radically in the last century. Initially, Earth was believed to be the [[Geocentric model|center of the Universe]],  
which consisted only of those planets visible with the [[classical planet|naked eye]] and an outlying sphere of [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |pages=5–20 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=1957 |isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] in the 17th century, observations by [[William Herschel]] and others showed that the Sun lay within a vast, disc-shaped [[galaxy]] of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1781: William Herschel Reveals the Shape of our Galaxy|url=http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326182039/http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, observations of [[spiral nebula]]e revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an [[expanding universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiral Nebulae and the Great Debate|publisher=[[Eberly College of Science]]|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l9_p2.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929: Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe is Expanding|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1929|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; grouped into clusters and [[supercluster]]s. By the end of the 20th century, the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|overall structure]] of the visible universe was becoming clearer, with superclusters forming into a vast web of [[galactic filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989: Margaret Geller and John Huchra Map the Universe|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1989|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superclusters, filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the Universe that we can observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure of the Universe|author= Villanueva, John Carl |publisher=[[Universe Today]]|year=2009|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37360/structure-of-the-universe/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At still larger scales (over 1000 [[megaparsec]]s{{efn|name=parsec|A parsec (pc) is the distance at which a star's [[parallax]] as viewed from Earth is equal to one [[second of arc]], equal to roughly 206,000&amp;nbsp;AU or 3.0857×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km.

Production at Margham commenced in 1984, with three major gas-bearing formations located up to 10,000 feet below sea level. The field is connected by pipeline to Jebel Ali, where the gas condensate is loaded onto tankers for export. Dry gas is now also sent by pipeline to supply the Dubai grid, with consumption increasing since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2018/01/10/10181701/uae-bets-on-alternative-energy-local-gas-production/|title=UAE bets on alternative energy, local gas production|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margham was initially developed as a liquids stripping/gas recycling project (dry gas was pumped back into the reservoir),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.woodmac.com/reports/upstream-oil-and-gas-margham-field-gas-storage-project-1770930|title=Margham Field Gas Storage Project|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now operates as a gas storage facility for Dubai since 2008, allowing Dubai to depend on gas produced from Margham for its elecricity generation and desalination needs. This usage, together with sustainables such as DEWA's [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park]], means that Dubai has eliminated the use of oil as a domestic energy fuel.

Although it is a major producer with ambitions to develop its trading activities to become a major global LNG hub, the UAE is actually a net importer of LNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/dubai-supply-authority-agrees-deal-with-japan-s-jera-to-explore-lng-opportunities-1.19125|title=Dubai Supply Authority agrees deal with Japan’s Jera to explore LNG opportunities|work=The National|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However it does not include [[massless particle]]s such as [[photon]]s, or other energy phenomena or waves such as [[light]] or [[sound]].&lt;ref name=Penrose &gt;

These include classical everyday phases such as [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]] – for example [[water]] exists as ice, liquid water, and gaseous steam – but other states are possible, including [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, [[fermionic condensate]]s, and [[quark–gluon plasma]].&lt;ref name=RHIC&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However this is only somewhat correct, because subatomic particles and their properties are governed by their [[quantum mechanics|quantum nature]], which means they do not act as everyday objects appear to act – they can act like [[wave-particle duality|waves as well as particles]] and they do not have well-defined sizes or positions. In the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]], matter is not a fundamental concept because the [[elementary particle|elementary constituents]] of atoms are [[quantum]] entities which do not have an inherent "size" or "[[volume]]" in any everyday sense of the word. Due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] and other [[fundamental interaction]]s, some "[[point particle]]s" known as [[fermion]]s ([[quark]]s, [[lepton]]s), and many composites and atoms, are effectively forced to keep a distance from other particles under everyday conditions; this creates the property of matter which appears to us as matter taking up space.

For much of the history of the [[natural science]]s people have contemplated the exact nature of matter. The idea that matter was built of discrete building blocks, the so-called ''[[particulate theory of matter]]'', was first put forward by the Greek philosophers [[Leucippus]] (~490 BC) and [[Democritus]] (~470–380 BC).&lt;ref&gt;

==Comparison with mass==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matter is a general term describing any ''''physical substance''''. By contrast,  [[mass]] is not a substance but rather a quantitative ''property'' of matter and other substances or systems; various types of mass are defined within [[physics]] – including but not limited to [[rest mass]], [[inertial mass]], [[relativistic mass]], [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy]].  

While there are different views on what should be considered matter, the mass of a substance has exact scientific definitions.  Another difference is that matter has an "opposite" called antimatter, but mass has no opposite—there is no such thing as "anti-mass" or [[negative mass]], so far as is known, although scientists do discuss the concept.  Antimatter has the same (i.e. positive) mass property as its normal matter counterpart.

Different fields of science use the term matter in different, and sometimes incompatible, ways. Some of these ways are based on loose historical meanings, from a time when there was no reason to distinguish mass from simply a quantity of matter. As such, there is no single universally agreed scientific meaning of the word "matter". Scientifically, the term "mass" is well-defined, but "matter" can be defined in several ways. Sometimes in the field of physics "matter" is simply equated with particles that exhibit rest mass (i.e., that cannot travel at the speed of light), such as quarks and leptons. However, in both [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], matter exhibits both [[wave]]-like and [[particle]]-like properties, the so-called [[wave–particle duality]].&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;

== Definition ==

=== Based on atoms ===

A definition of "matter" based on its physical and chemical structure is: ''matter is made up of [[atom]]s''.&lt;ref name=Barker0&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such ''atomic matter'' is also sometimes termed ''ordinary matter''. As an example, [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] [[molecule]]s (DNA) are matter under this definition because they are made of atoms. This definition can be extended to include charged atoms and molecules, so as to include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s (gases of ions) and [[electrolyte]]s (ionic solutions), which are not obviously included in the atoms definition. Alternatively, one can adopt the [[#Protons, neutrons and electrons definition|''protons, neutrons, and electrons'' definition]].

=== Based on protons, neutrons and electrons ===
A definition of "matter" more fine-scale than the atoms and molecules definition is: ''matter is made up of what [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s are made of'', meaning anything made of positively charged [[proton]]s, neutral [[neutron]]s, and negatively charged [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name=DePodesta1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition goes beyond atoms and molecules, however, to include substances made from these building blocks that are ''not'' simply atoms or molecules, for example electron beams in an old [[cathode ray tube]] television, or [[white dwarf]] matter—typically, carbon and oxygen nuclei in a sea of degenerate electrons. At a microscopic level, the constituent "particles" of matter such as protons, neutrons, and electrons obey the laws of quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality. At an even deeper level, protons and neutrons are made up of [[quark]]s and the force fields ([[gluon]]s) that bind them together, leading to the next definition.

=== Based on quarks and leptons ===
[[File:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Under the "quarks and leptons" definition, the elementary and composite particles made of the [[quarks]] (in purple) and [[leptons]] (in green) would be matter—while the gauge bosons (in red) would not be matter. However, interaction energy inherent to composite particles (for example, gluons involved in neutrons and protons) contribute to the mass of ordinary matter.]]

As seen in the above discussion, many early definitions of what can be called "ordinary matter" were based upon its structure or "building blocks".  On the scale of elementary particles, a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as: 
"ordinary matter is everything that is composed of [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s", or "ordinary matter is everything that is composed of any elementary fermions except antiquarks and antileptons".&lt;ref name=Povh0&gt;

 |quote="''(From Abstract:)'' Positive baryon numbers (A&gt;0) and positive lepton numbers (L&gt;0) characterize matter particles while negative baryon numbers and negative lepton numbers characterize antimatter particles. Matter particles and antimatter particles belong to two distinct classes of particles. Matter neutral particles are particles characterized by both zero baryon number and zero lepton number. This third class of particles includes mesons formed by a quark and an antiquark pair (a pair of matter particle and antimatter particle) and bosons which are messengers of known interactions (photons for electromagnetism, W and Z bosons for the weak interaction, gluons for the strong interaction). The antiparticle of a matter particle belongs to the class of antimatter particles, the antiparticle of an antimatter particle belongs to the class of matter particles."

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between these formulations follows.

Leptons (the most famous being the [[electron]]), and quarks (of which [[baryons]], such as [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], are made) combine to form [[atoms]], which in turn form [[molecules]]. Because atoms and molecules are said to be matter, it is natural to phrase the definition as: "ordinary matter is anything that is made of the same things that atoms and molecules are made of". (However, notice that one also can make from these building blocks matter that is ''not'' atoms or molecules.) Then, because electrons are leptons, and protons, and neutrons are made of quarks, this definition in turn leads to the definition of matter as being "quarks and leptons", which are two of the four types of elementary fermions (the other two being antiquarks and antileptons, which can be considered antimatter as described later).

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, [[mass]] is not something that is exclusive to ordinary matter.

The quark–lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example). Such composites contain an interaction energy that holds the constituents together, and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite. As an example, to a great extent, the mass of an atom is simply the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons. However, digging deeper, the protons and neutrons are made up of quarks bound together by gluon fields (see [[Quantum chromodynamics#Dynamics|dynamics of quantum chromodynamics]]) and these gluons fields contribute significantly to the mass of hadrons.&lt;ref name=Aitchison&gt;

The Standard Model groups matter particles into three generations, where each generation consists of two quarks and two leptons. The first generation is the ''[[up quark|up]]'' and ''[[down quark|down]]'' quarks, the ''[[electron]]'' and the ''[[electron neutrino]]''; the second includes the ''[[charm quark|charm]]'' and ''[[strange quark|strange]]'' quarks, the ''[[muon]]'' and the ''[[muon neutrino]]''; the third generation consists of the ''[[top quark|top]]'' and ''[[bottom quark|bottom]]'' quarks and the ''[[tau (particle)|tau]]'' and ''[[tau neutrino]]''.&lt;ref name=Staley&gt;

This quark–lepton definition of matter also leads to what can be described as "conservation of (net) matter" laws—discussed later below.  Alternatively, one could return to the mass–volume–space concept of matter, leading to the next definition, in which antimatter becomes included as a subclass of matter.

=== Based on elementary fermions (mass, volume, and space) ===

A common or traditional definition of matter is "anything that has [[mass]] and [[volume]] (occupies [[space]])".&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite book|author=S.M. Walker |author2=A. King|date=2005|title=What is Matter?|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o7EquxOl4MAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=matter|page=7|publisher=[[Lerner Publications]]|isbn=0-8225-5131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hage&gt;{{cite book| author=J.Kenkel |author2=P.B.

The observation that matter occupies space goes back to antiquity. However, an explanation for why matter occupies space is recent, and is argued to be a result of the phenomenon described in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]],&lt;ref name=Peacock&gt;{{cite book|author=K.A. Peacock| date=2008|title=The Quantum Revolution: A Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ITqnf5jdE5QC&amp;pg=PA47|page=47|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0-313-33448-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kreiger&gt;{{cite book|author=M.H.

Two particular examples where the exclusion principle clearly relates matter to the occupation of space are white dwarf stars and neutron stars, discussed further below.

Thus, matter can be defined as everything composed of elementary fermions. Although we don't encounter them in everyday life, antiquarks (such as the [[antiproton]]) and antileptons (such as the [[positron]]) are the [[antiparticle]]s of the quark and the lepton, are elementary fermions as well, and have essentially the same properties as quarks and leptons, including the applicability of the Pauli exclusion principle which can be said to prevent two particles from being in the same place at the same time (in the same state), i.e. makes each particle "take up space".  This particular definition leads to matter being defined to include anything made of these [[antimatter]] particles as well as the ordinary quark and lepton, and thus also anything made of [[meson]]s, which are unstable particles made up of a quark and an antiquark.

=== In general relativity and cosmology ===

In the context of [[theory of relativity|relativity]], mass is not an additive quantity, in the sense that one can not add the rest masses of particles in a system to get the total rest mass of the system.&lt;ref name=Penrose/&gt; Thus, in relativity usually a more general view is that it is not the sum of [[rest mass]]es, but the [[Stress–energy tensor|energy–momentum tensor]] that quantifies the amount of matter. This tensor gives the rest mass for the entire system. "Matter" therefore is sometimes considered as anything that contributes to the energy–momentum of a system, that is, anything that is not purely gravity.&lt;ref name=Caroll&gt;

== Structure ==

In particle physics, fermions are particles that obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. Fermions can be elementary, like the electron—or composite, like the proton and neutron. In the [[Standard Model]], there are two types of elementary fermions: quarks and leptons, which are discussed next.

=== Quarks ===
{{Main article|Quark}}
Quarks are particles of [[fermion|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], implying that they are [[fermion]]s. They carry an [[electric charge]] of −{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|e]] (down-type quarks) or +{{frac|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;e (up-type quarks). For comparison, an electron has a charge of −1&amp;nbsp;e. They also carry [[colour charge]], which is the equivalent of the electric charge for the [[strong interaction]]. Quarks also undergo [[radioactive decay]], meaning that they are subject to the [[weak interaction]]. Quarks are massive particles, and therefore are also subject to [[gravity]].

==== Baryonic matter ====
{{main article|Baryon}}
Baryons are strongly interacting fermions, and so are subject to Fermi–Dirac statistics. Amongst the baryons are the protons and neutrons, which occur in atomic nuclei, but many other unstable baryons exist as well. The term [[baryon]] usually refers to triquarks—particles made of three quarks. Also, "exotic" baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark are known as [[pentaquark]]s, but their existence is not generally accepted.

Baryonic matter is the part of the universe that is made of baryons (including all atoms). This part of the universe does not include [[dark energy]], [[dark matter]], [[black holes]] or various forms of degenerate matter, such as compose [[white dwarf]] stars and [[neutron star]]s. Microwave light seen by [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP), suggests that only about 4.6% of that part of the universe within range of the best [[telescope]]s (that is, matter that may be visible because light could reach us from it), is made of baryonic matter. About 26.8% is dark matter, and about 68.3% is dark energy.&lt;ref name="NASA Science Dark Matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/ |title=Dark Energy Dark Matter |website=NASA Science: Astrophysics |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of fact, the great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10 per cent of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass–energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Hadronic matter====
Hadronic matter can refer to 'ordinary' baryonic matter, made from [[hadron]]s ([[Baryon]]s and [[meson]]s), or [[quark matter]] (a generalisation  of atomic nuclei), ie. the 'low' temperature [[QCD matter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4469 ''The Phase Diagram of Hadronic Matter'']&lt;/ref&gt; It includes [[degenerate matter]] and the result of high energy heavy nuclei collisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/706/3/032001 Modelling Hadronic Matter, D Menzes]&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct from [[dark matter]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] requires that only two fermions can occupy a quantum state, one spin-up and the other spin-down. Hence, at zero temperature, the fermions fill up sufficient levels to accommodate all the available fermions—and in the case of many fermions, the maximum kinetic energy (called the ''[[Fermi energy]]'') and the pressure of the gas becomes very large, and depends on the number of fermions rather than the temperature, unlike normal states of matter.

Degenerate matter is thought to occur during the evolution of heavy stars.&lt;ref name=Goldberg1&gt;

Degenerate matter includes the part of the universe that is made up of neutron stars and white dwarfs.

==== Strange matter ====
{{main article|Strange matter}}
''Strange matter'' is a particular form of [[quark matter]], usually thought of as a ''liquid'' of [[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], and [[strange quark|strange]] [[quark]]s. It is contrasted with [[nuclear matter]], which is a liquid of [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark matter, which is a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange matter is expected to be [[color superconductor|color superconducting]]. Strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of [[neutron star]]s, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from [[femtometer]]s ([[strangelet]]s) to kilometers ([[quark star]]s).

===== Two meanings of the term "strange matter" =====

In [[particle physics]] and [[astrophysics]], the term is used in two ways, one broader and the other more specific.
# The broader meaning is just quark matter that contains three flavors of quarks: up, down, and strange. In this definition, there is a critical pressure and an associated critical density, and when nuclear matter (made of [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) is compressed beyond this density, the protons and neutrons dissociate into quarks, yielding quark matter (probably strange matter).
# The narrower meaning is quark matter that is ''more stable than nuclear matter''. The idea that this could happen is the "strange matter hypothesis" of Bodmer&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, the critical pressure is zero: the true ground state of matter is ''always'' quark matter. The nuclei that we see in the matter around us, which are droplets of nuclear matter, are actually [[metastable]], and given enough time (or the right external stimulus) would decay into droplets of strange matter, i.e. [[strangelet]]s.

=== Leptons ===
{{Main article|Lepton}}

Leptons are particles of [[fermion|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], meaning that they are [[fermion]]s. They carry an [[electric charge]] of −1&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|e]] (charged leptons) or 0&amp;nbsp;e (neutrinos). Unlike quarks, leptons do not carry [[colour charge]], meaning that they do not experience the [[strong interaction]]. Leptons also undergo radioactive decay, meaning that they are subject to the [[weak interaction]]. Leptons are massive particles, therefore are subject to gravity.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phase is a form of matter that has a relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties (such as [[density]], [[specific heat]], [[refractive index]], and so forth). These phases include the three familiar ones ([[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es), as well as more exotic states of matter (such as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, [[superfluid]]s, [[supersolid]]s, [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, ...). A ''[[fluid]]'' may be a liquid, gas or plasma. There are also [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] phases of [[magnetic material]]s. As conditions change, matter may change from one phase into another. These phenomena are called [[phase transition]]s, and are studied in the field of [[thermodynamics]]. In nanomaterials, the vastly increased ratio of surface area to volume results in matter that can exhibit properties entirely different from those of bulk material, and not well described by any bulk phase (see [[nanomaterials]] for more details).

Phases are sometimes called ''states of matter'', but this term can lead to confusion with [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic states]]. For example, two gases maintained at different pressures are in different ''thermodynamic states'' (different pressures), but in the same ''phase'' (both are gases).

== Antimatter ==
{{main article|Antimatter}}
{{unsolved|physics|[[Baryon asymmetry]]. Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe? }}
In [[particle physics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], ''antimatter'' is matter that is composed of the [[antiparticle]]s of those that constitute ordinary matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come into contact with each other, the two [[annihilation|annihilate]]; that is, they may both be converted into other particles with equal [[energy]] in accordance with [[Einstein]]'s equation {{nowrap|[[E=MC2|''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]}}. These new particles may be high-energy [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s) or other particle–antiparticle pairs. The resulting particles are endowed with an amount of kinetic energy equal to the difference between the [[rest mass]] of the products of the annihilation and the rest mass of the original particle–antiparticle pair, which is often quite large.  Depending on which definition of "matter" is adopted, antimatter can be said to be a particular subclass of matter, or the opposite of matter.

Antimatter is not found naturally on Earth, except very briefly and in vanishingly small quantities (as the result of [[radioactive decay]], [[lightning]] or [[cosmic ray]]s). This is because antimatter that came to exist on Earth outside the confines of a suitable physics laboratory would almost instantly meet the ordinary matter that Earth is made of, and be annihilated. Antiparticles and some stable antimatter (such as [[antihydrogen]]) can be made in tiny amounts, but not in enough quantity to do more than test a few of its theoretical properties.

There is considerable speculation both in [[science]] and [[science fiction]] as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter (in the sense of quarks and leptons but not antiquarks or antileptons), and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter (antiquarks and antileptons) instead. In the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called [[CP violation|CP (charge-parity) symmetry violation]], which can be obtained from the Standard Model,&lt;ref name=CP&gt;

Formally, antimatter particles can be defined by their negative [[baryon number]] or [[lepton number]], while "normal" (non-antimatter) matter particles have positive baryon or lepton number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Conservation of matter ==

Two quantities that can define an amount of matter in the quark–lepton sense (and antimatter in an antiquark–antilepton sense), [[baryon number]] and [[lepton number]], are [[conservation law|conserved]] in the Standard Model. A [[baryon]] such as the proton or neutron has a baryon number of one, and a quark, because there are three in a baryon, is given a baryon number of 1/3.  So the net amount of matter, as measured by the number of quarks (minus the number of antiquarks, which each have a baryon number of −1/3), which is proportional to baryon number, and number of leptons (minus antileptons), which is called the lepton number, is practically impossible to change in any process.   Even in a nuclear bomb, none of the baryons (protons and neutrons of which the atomic nuclei are composed) are destroyed—there are as many baryons after as before the reaction, so none of these matter particles are actually destroyed and none are even converted to non-matter particles (like photons of light or radiation).  Instead, [[nuclear binding energy|nuclear]] (and perhaps [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy|chromodynamic) binding energy]] is released, as these baryons become bound into mid-size nuclei having less energy (and, [[Mass–energy equivalence|equivalently]], less [[mass per nucleon|mass) per nucleon]] compared to the original small (hydrogen) and large (plutonium etc.) nuclei.  Even in [[electron–positron annihilation]], there is no net matter being destroyed, because there was zero net matter (zero total lepton number and baryon number) to begin with before the annihilation—one lepton minus one antilepton equals zero net lepton number—and this net amount matter does not change as it simply remains zero after the annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So the only way to really "destroy" or "convert" ordinary matter is to pair it with the same amount of antimatter so that their "matterness" cancels out—but in practice there is almost no antimatter generally available in the universe (see [[baryon asymmetry]] and [[leptogenesis (physics)|leptogenesis]]) with which to do so.

==Historical development==

===Antiquity (c. 610 BC–c. 322 BC) ===
The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]] were among the first recorded speculators about the underlying nature of the visible world. [[Thales]] (c. 624 BC–c. 546 BC) regarded water as the fundamental material of the world. [[Anaximander]] (c. 610 BC–c. 546 BC) posited that the basic material was wholly characterless or limitless: the Infinite (''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''). [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (flourished 585 BC, d. 528 BC) posited that the basic stuff was ''pneuma'' or air. [[Heraclitus]] (c. 535–c. 475 BC) seems to say the basic element is fire, though perhaps he means that all is change. [[Empedocles]] (c. 490–430 BC) spoke of four [[Classical element|element]]s of which everything was made: earth, water, air, and fire.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=S. Toulmin |author2=J. Goodfield
 |date=1962
 |title=The Architecture of Matter
 |publisher=University of Chicago Press
 |pages=48–54
 |isbn=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Parmenides]] argued that change does not exist, and [[Democritus]] argued that everything is composed of minuscule, inert bodies of all shapes called atoms, a philosophy called [[atomism]]. All of these notions had deep philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed by Aristotle in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', esp. book I, but also later; as well as ''Metaphysics'' I–II.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] (384 BC – 322 BC) was the first to put the conception on a sound philosophical basis, which he did in his natural philosophy, especially in [[Physics (Aristotle)|''Physics'']] book I.&lt;ref&gt;For a good explanation and elaboration, see {{cite book
 |author=R.J. Connell
 |date=1966
 |title=Matter and Becoming
 |publisher=Priory Press
 |isbn=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted as reasonable suppositions the four [[Classical element|Empedoclean elements]], but added a fifth, [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. Nevertheless, these elements are not basic in Aristotle's mind. Rather they, like everything else in the visible world, are composed of the basic ''principles'' matter and form.

{{quotation|For my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be without qualification, and which persists in the result.|Aristotle|Physics I:9:192a32}}

The word Aristotle uses for matter, [[hyle|ὕλη (''hyle'' or ''hule'')]], can be literally translated as wood or timber, that is, "raw material" for building.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Aristotle's conception of matter is intrinsically linked to something being made or composed. In other words, in contrast to the early modern conception of matter as simply occupying space, matter for Aristotle is definitionally linked to process or change: matter is what underlies a change of substance. For example, a horse eats grass: the horse changes the grass into itself; the grass as such does not persist in the horse, but some aspect of it—its matter—does. The matter is not specifically described (e.g., as [[atom]]s), but consists of whatever persists in the change of substance from grass to horse. Matter in this understanding does not exist independently (i.e., as a [[Substance theory|substance]]), but exists interdependently (i.e., as a "principle") with form and only insofar as it underlies change. It can be helpful to conceive of the relationship of matter and form as very similar to that between parts and whole. For Aristotle, matter as such can only ''receive'' actuality from form; it has no activity or actuality in itself, similar to the way that parts as such only have their existence ''in'' a whole (otherwise they would be independent wholes).

===Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ===

[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) originated the modern conception of matter. He was primarily a geometer. Instead of, like Aristotle, deducing the existence of matter from the physical reality of change, Descartes arbitrarily postulated matter to be an abstract, mathematical substance that occupies space:
{{quotation|So, extension in length, breadth, and depth, constitutes the nature of bodily substance; and thought constitutes the nature of thinking substance. And everything else attributable to body presupposes extension, and is only a mode of extended|René Descartes|Principles of Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;

 |chapter=The Principles of Human Knowledge

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Descartes, matter has only the property of extension, so its only activity aside from locomotion is to exclude other bodies:&lt;ref&gt;though even this property seems to be non-essential (René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' II [1644], "On the Principles of Material Things", no. 4.)&lt;/ref&gt; this is the [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]]. Descartes makes an absolute distinction between mind, which he defines as unextended, thinking substance, and matter, which he defines as unthinking, extended substance.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |author=R. Descartes
 |chapter=The Principles of Human Knowledge
 |date=1644
 |title=Principles of Philosophy I
 |pages=8, 54, 63
 |publisher=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are independent things. In contrast, Aristotle defines matter and the formal/forming principle as complementary ''principles'' that together compose one independent thing ([[Substance theory|substance]]). In short, Aristotle defines matter (roughly speaking) as what things are actually made of (with a ''potential'' independent existence), but Descartes elevates matter to an actual independent thing in itself.

The continuity and difference between Descartes' and Aristotle's conceptions is noteworthy. In both conceptions, matter is passive or inert. In the respective conceptions matter has different relationships to intelligence. For Aristotle, matter and intelligence (form) exist together in an interdependent relationship, whereas for Descartes, matter and intelligence (mind) are definitionally opposed, independent [[Substance theory|substances]].&lt;ref&gt;

Descartes' justification for restricting the inherent qualities of matter to extension is its permanence, but his real criterion is not permanence (which equally applied to color and resistance), but his desire to use geometry to explain all material properties.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Burtt, ''Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company, 1954), 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Descartes, Hobbes, Boyle, and Locke argued that the inherent properties of bodies were limited to extension, and that so-called secondary qualities, like color, were only products of human perception.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. McGuire and P.M. Heimann, "The Rejection of Newton's Concept of Matter in the Eighteenth Century", ''The Concept of Matter in Modern Philosophy'' ed. Ernan McMullin (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1978), 104–118 (105).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) inherited Descartes' mechanical conception of matter. In the third of his "Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy", Newton lists the universal qualities of matter as "extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and inertia".&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy'', trans. A. Motte, revised by F. Cajori (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1934), pp. 398–400. Further analyzed by Maurice A. Finocchiaro, "Newton's Third Rule of Philosophizing: A Role for Logic in Historiography", ''Isis'' 65:1 (Mar. 1974), pp. 66–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in ''Optics'' he conjectures that God created matter as "solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles", which were "...even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''Optics'', Book III, pt. 1, query 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The "primary" properties of matter were amenable to mathematical description, unlike "secondary" qualities such as color or taste. Like Descartes, Newton rejected the essential nature of secondary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire and Heimann, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton developed Descartes' notion of matter by restoring to matter intrinsic properties in addition to extension (at least on a limited basis), such as mass. Newton's use of gravitational force, which worked "at a distance", effectively repudiated Descartes' mechanics, in which interactions happened exclusively by contact.&lt;ref name=Chomsky/&gt;

Though Newton's gravity would seem to be a ''power'' of bodies, Newton himself did not admit it to be an ''essential'' property of matter. Carrying the logic forward more consistently, [[Joseph Priestley]] (1733–1804) argued that corporeal properties transcend contact mechanics: chemical properties require the ''capacity'' for attraction.&lt;ref name=Chomsky/&gt; He argued matter has other inherent powers besides the so-called primary qualities of Descartes, et al.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire and Heimann, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
Since Priestley's time, there has been a massive expansion in knowledge of the constituents of the material world (viz., molecules, atoms, subatomic particles), but there has been no further development in the ''definition'' of matter. Rather the question has been set aside. [[Noam Chomsky]] (born 1928) summarizes the situation that has prevailed since that time:
{{quotation|What is the concept of body that finally emerged?[...] The answer is that there is no clear and definite conception of body.[...] Rather, the material world is whatever we discover it to be, with whatever properties it must be assumed to have for the purposes of explanatory theory. Any intelligible theory that offers genuine explanations and that can be assimilated to the core notions of physics becomes part of the theory of the material world, part of our account of body. If we have such a theory in some domain, we seek to assimilate it to the core notions of physics, perhaps modifying these notions as we carry out this enterprise. |Noam Chomsky|''Language and problems of knowledge: the Managua lectures'', p. 144&lt;ref name=Chomsky&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

So matter is whatever physics studies and the object of study of physics is matter: there is no independent general definition of matter, apart from its fitting into the methodology of measurement and controlled experimentation. In sum, the boundaries between what constitutes matter and everything else remains as vague as the [[demarcation problem]] of delimiting science from everything else.&lt;ref&gt;Nevertheless, it remains true that the mathematization regarded as requisite for a modern physical theory carries its own implicit notion of matter, which is very like Descartes', despite the demonstrated vacuity of the latter's notions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, following the development of the [[periodic table]], and of [[atomic theory]], [[atom]]s were seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter; atoms formed [[molecules]] and [[compound (chemistry)|compounds]].&lt;ref name=Wenham&gt;

The common definition in terms of occupying space and having mass is in contrast with most physical and chemical definitions of matter, which rely instead upon its structure and upon attributes not necessarily related to volume and mass. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the knowledge of matter began a rapid evolution.

Aspects of the Newtonian view still held sway. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] discussed matter in his work ''Matter and Motion''.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carefully separates "matter" from space and time, and defines it in terms of the object referred to in [[Newton's first law of motion]].

However, the Newtonian picture was not the whole story. In the 19th century, the term "matter" was actively discussed by a host of scientists and philosophers, and a brief outline can be found in Levere.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Three divisions of matter are recognized in science: masses, molecules and atoms. &lt;br /&gt;A Mass of matter is any portion of matter appreciable by the senses. &lt;br /&gt;A Molecule is the smallest particle of matter into which a body can be divided without losing its identity. &lt;br /&gt;An Atom is a still smaller particle produced by division of a molecule. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than simply having the attributes of mass and occupying space, matter was held to have chemical and electrical properties. In 1909 the famous physicist [[J. J. Thomson]] (1856–1940) wrote about the "constitution of matter" and was concerned with the possible connection between matter and electrical charge.&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;

In the late 19th century with the [[Thomson experiment|discovery]] of the [[electron]], and in the early 20th century, with the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment|discovery]] of the [[atomic nucleus]], and the birth of [[particle physics]], matter was seen as made up of electrons, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s interacting to form atoms. Today, we know that even protons and neutrons are not indivisible, they can be divided into [[quark]]s, while electrons are part of a particle family called [[lepton]]s. Both [[#Quarks and leptons definition|quarks and leptons]] are [[elementary particle]]s, and are currently seen as being the fundamental constituents of matter.&lt;ref name=Povh1&gt;
The history of the concept of matter is a history of the fundamental ''length scales'' used to define matter. Different building blocks apply depending upon whether one defines matter on an atomic or elementary particle level. One may use a definition that matter is atoms, or that matter is [[hadron]]s, or that matter is leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.

==Summary==
The modern conception of matter has been refined many times in history, in light of the improvement in knowledge of just ''what'' the basic building blocks are, and in how they interact.
The term "matter" is used throughout physics in a bewildering variety of contexts: for example, one refers to "[[condensed matter physics]]",&lt;ref name=Chaikin&gt;

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917). Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, ''Physicalische Zeitschrift'' '''18''': 121–128. Translated in {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

Recent experiments even confirm the relations for molecules and even [[macromolecule]]s that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects.

In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], since it was also proposed by [[Max Planck|Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955).

Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927).

Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009).

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

A '''molecule''' is an [[electrically]] neutral group of two or more [[atom]]s held together by [[chemical bond]]s.&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;{{GoldBookRef| title=Molecule|file=M04002|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Ebbin, Darrell D.| title= General Chemistry |edition=3rd| date= 1990| publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Co.]]| location= Boston| isbn= 0-395-43302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Brown, T.L. |author2=Kenneth C.

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.
{{clear}}

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covalent ===
{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last= Campbell| first= Neil A.| title= Biology: Exploring Life| url= http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate= 2012-02-05| year= 2006| publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]| location= Boston, Massachusetts| isbn= 0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B. Gray|author3=Harry B. Gray| title= Chemical structure and bonding| url= https://books.google.com/?id=q77rPHP5fWMC&amp;pg=PA199| date= 1989| publisher= University Science Books| isbn= 0-935702-61-X| page= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

== Molecular geometry ==
{{Main|Molecular geometry}}

[[File:Cyanostar STM.png|thumb|left|upright|Structure and [[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] image of a "cyanostar" [[dendrimer]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C4CC03725A|pmid=25080328|title=Anion-induced dimerization of 5-fold symmetric cyanostars in 3D crystalline solids and 2D self-assembled crystals|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=50|issue=69|pages=9827–30|year=2014|last1=Hirsch|first1=Brandon E.|last2=Lee|first2=Semin|last3=Qiao|first3=Bo|last4=Chen|first4=Chun-Hsing|last5=McDonald|first5=Kevin P.|last6=Tait|first6=Steven L.|last7=Flood|first7=Amar H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

== Molecular spectroscopy ==
{{Main|Spectroscopy}}

[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [[single-molecule electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850|pmc=4322354|title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|page=8350|year=2015|bibcode= 2015NatSR...5E8350Z|author1=Zoldan|first1=V. C.|last2=Faccio|first2=R|last3=Pasa|first3=A. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 4546 (2001)] |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=9886–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15268005 |doi=10.1063/1.1704638 |bibcode= 2004JChPh.120.9886A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}".

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

{{Main|Ecology|Ecosystem}}
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.
[[File:PenasBlancas, part of the Bosawas Reserve, Jinotega Department, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|left|Peñas Blancas, part of the [[Bosawás Biosphere Reserve]]. Located northeast of the city of [[Jinotega]] in Northeastern Nicaragua.]]
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|[[Old-growth forest|Old growth]] [[European Beech]] forest in [[Biogradska Gora]] National Park, [[Montenegro]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

==Human interrelationship==
{{Human timeline}}
[[File:Na Pali Coast - Kauai.jpg|thumb|left|Despite their natural beauty, the secluded valleys along the [[Na Pali Coast]] in Hawaii are heavily modified by introduced [[invasive species]] such as [[She-oak]].]]
Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]
{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I. Overview of products and scientific results – Table 9. |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=P. A. R. |last1=Ade |first2=N. |last2=Aghanim |first3=C. |last3=Armitage-Caplan |last4=et al.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

==Beyond Earth==
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] ''(Sizes to scale, distances and illumination not to scale)'']]
[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

The existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on the particular [[physical cosmology|cosmological model]].

==Conformal time and the particle horizon==
In terms of [[comoving distance]], the particle horizon is equal to the '''conformal time''' &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; that has passed since the [[Big Bang]], times the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. In general, the conformal time at a certain time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{dt'}{a(t')},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], and we have taken the Big Bang to be at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;. By convention, a subscript 0 indicates "today" so that the conformal time today &lt;math&gt;\eta(t_0) = \eta_0 = 1.48 \times 10^{18}\text{ s}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the conformal time is not the [[age of the universe]]. Rather, the conformal time is the amount of time it would take a photon to travel from where we are located to the furthest observable distance provided the universe ceased expanding. As such, &lt;math&gt;\eta_0&lt;/math&gt; is not a physically meaningful time (this much time has not yet actually passed), though, as we will see, the particle horizon with which it is associated is a conceptually meaningful distance.

The particle horizon recedes constantly as time passes and the conformal time grows. As such, the observed size of the universe always increases.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Paul Hobson|author2=George Efstathiou|author3=Anthony N.

:&lt;math&gt;a(t) H_p(t) = a(t) \int_{0}^{t} \frac{c\,dt'}{a(t')}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H_p(t_0) = c\eta_0 = 14.4\text{ Gpc} = 46.9\text{ billion light years}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Evolution of the particle horizon==

In this section we consider the [[FLRW]] cosmological model. In that context, the universe can be approximated as composed by non-interacting constituents, each one being a perfect fluid with density &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, partial pressure &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and state equation &lt;math&gt;p_i=\omega_i \rho_i&lt;/math&gt;, such that they add up to the total density  &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and total pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* Hubble function   &lt;math&gt;H=\frac{\dot a}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
* The critical density   &lt;math&gt;\rho_c=\frac{3}{8\pi}H^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H(z)=H_0\sqrt{\sum \Omega_{i0}(1+z)^{n_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_i=3(1+\omega_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the addition ranges over all possible partial constituents and in particular there can be countably infinitely many. With this notation we have:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{The particle horizon } H_p \text{ exists if and only if } N&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the largest &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; (possibly infinite). The evolution of the particle horizon for an expanding universe (&lt;math&gt;\dot{a}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) is:&lt;ref name="Evolution2" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH_p}{dt}=H_p(z)H(z)+c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light and can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; (natural units). Notice that the derivative is made with respect to the FLRW-time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, while the functions are evaluated at the redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which are related as stated before. We have an analogous but slightly different result for [[event horizon]].

==Horizon problem==
{{main|Horizon problem}}
The concept of a particle horizon can be used to illustrate the famous horizon problem, which is an unresolved issue associated with the [[Big Bang]] model. Extrapolating back to the time of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] when the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) was emitted, we obtain a particle horizon of about

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = c\eta_\text{CMB} = 284\text{ Mpc} = 8.9 \times 10^{-3} H_p(t_0) &lt;/math&gt;}}

which corresponds to a proper size at that time of:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; a_\text{CMB}H_p(t_\text{CMB}) = 261\text{ kpc} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Since we observe the CMB to be emitted essentially from our particle horizon (&lt;math&gt;284\text{ Mpc} \ll 14.4\text{ Gpc}&lt;/math&gt;), our expectation is that parts of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) that are separated by about a fraction of a [[great circle]] across the sky of

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{H_p(t_\text{CMB})}{H_p(t_0)}&lt;/math&gt;}}

(an [[angular size]] of &lt;math&gt;\theta \sim 1.7^\circ&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmic Microwave Background Temperature Power Spectrum|url=http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/postgrad/pedagogy/2006_tojeiro.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be out of [[causal contact]] with each other. That the entire CMB is in [[thermal equilibrium]] and approximates a [[blackbody]] so well is therefore not explained by the standard explanations about the way the [[expansion of the universe]] proceeds. The most popular resolution to this problem is [[cosmic inflation]].

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pdf/reference/Source%20Energy.pdf|title=Technical Reference: Source Energy|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U.S [[Energy Information Administration]], for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/|title=Total Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php|title=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.php|title=Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] program recommends using source energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference|title=The difference between source and site energy|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] uses site energy in its definition of a [[Zero-energy building|zero net energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/doe-releases-common-definition-zero-energy-buildings-campuses-and|title=DOE Releases Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings, Campuses, and Communities|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Energy accidents}}

Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution.

Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion kWh.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#2f9f079649d2 How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources James Conca, June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''relational theory of space''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory according to which [[space]] is composed of relations between objects, with the implication that it cannot exist in the absence of matter. Its opposite is the [[container space|container]] theory. A [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[physics|physical]] theory implies a [[relation (philosophy)|relational metaphysics]], but not the other way round: even if space is composed of nothing but relations between [[observer (relativity)|observer]]s and [[event (relativity)|event]]s, it would be conceptually possible for all observers to agree on their measurements, whereas relativity implies they will disagree. [[Newtonian physics]] can be cast in [[Galilean invariance|relational terms]], but Newton insisted, for philosophical reasons, on [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] (container) space. The subject was famously debated by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and a supporter of Newton's in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

An absolute approach can also be applied to [[time]], with, for instance, the implication that there might have been vast epochs of time before the first [[event (philosophy)|event]].&lt;ref&gt;''Physics and Metaphysics: Theories of Space and Time'' by Jennifer Trusted, Routledge, 1991 {{ISBN|0-415-05948-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

'''Surface conductivity''' is an additional [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of an [[electrolyte]] in the vicinity of charged surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Surface and [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] correspond to the electrically driven motion of [[ions]] in an [[electric field]].&lt;/ref&gt; Close to charged surfaces a layer of [[counter ion]]s of opposite polarity exists which is attracted by the [[surface charge]]s. This layer of higher ionic concentration is a part of the interfacial [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. The concentration of the ions in this layer is higher as compared to the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] far from the charged surface and leads to a higher conductivity of this layer.

[[Marian Smoluchowski|Smoluchowski]] was the first to recognize the importance of surface conductivity at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. von Smoluchowski, Physik, Z., 6, 529 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a detailed description of surface conductivity by Lyklema in "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science" &lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol. 2, Academic Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Double Layer (DL) has two regions, according to the well established Gouy-Chapman-Stern model, Ref.2. The upper level, which is in contact with the bulk fluid is the [[diffuse layer]]. The inner layer that is in contact with interface is the [[Stern layer]].

It is possible that the lateral motion of ions in both parts of the DL contributes to the surface conductivity.

The contribution of the Stern layer is less well described. It is often called "additional surface conductivity".&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S. and Derjaguin, B.V. "Electrokinetic Phenomena", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the surface conductivity of the diffuse part of the DL was developed by Bikerman.&lt;ref&gt;Bikerman, J.J. Z.Physik.Chem. A163, 378, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; He derived a simple equation that links surface conductivity κ&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; with the behaviour of ions at the interface. For symmetrical electrolyte and assuming identical ions diffusion coefficients D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=D&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;=D it is given in Ref.2:

:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}^{\sigma} = \frac{4F^2Cz^2D(1+3m/z^2)}{RT\kappa}\left(\cosh\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:F is the [[Faraday constant]]
:T is the [[absolute temperature]]
:R is the [[gas constant]]
:C is the ionic concentration in the bulk fluid
:z is the [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
:ζ is the [[electrokinetic potential]]

The parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] to the motion of ions within the DL:
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Dukhin number]] is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the contribution of the surface conductivity to a variety of [[electrokinetic phenomena]], such as, [[electrophoresis]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

MEASUREMENTS ON ZnO SURFACES". Surface Science 54, 43 (1976). &lt;/ref&gt;. Surface conductivity differs from bulk conductivity for analogous reasons to the electrolyte solution case, where the [[Charge carrier|charge carriers]] of holes (+1) and electrons (-1) play the role of ions in solution.

The '''three-torus model''' is a [[cosmological model]] proposed in 1984 by [[Alexei Starobinsky]] and [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] at the Landau Institute in Moscow.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Overbeye, Dennis.  ''New York Times'' 11 March 2003: Web. 16 January 2011. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/science/universe-as-doughnut-new-data-new-debate.html “Universe as Doughnut: New Data, New Debate”]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory describes the [[shape of the universe]] (topology) as a [[Three-torus#Three-dimensional torus|three-dimensional torus]]. It is also informally known as the '''[[doughnut]] theory'''.{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}

The [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) was discovered by [[Bell Labs]] in 1964. Greater understanding of the universe's CMB provided greater understanding of the universe's topology{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}.  In order to understand these CMB results, [[NASA]] supported development of two exploratory satellites, the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE) in 1989{{clarify|did they just support development in this year?|date=May 2017}} and the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) in 2001{{clarify|did they just support development in this year?|date=May 2017}}.
