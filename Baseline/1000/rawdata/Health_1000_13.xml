      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8903">'''Adolescent health''', or youth health, is the range of approaches to preventing, detecting or treating young people’s health and well being &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/adolescent-health-recommendations/en/ WHO 2017, recommendations on adolescent health: guidelines approved by the WHO Review, Geneva: World Health Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The term [[adolescence|adolescent]] and [[youth|young people]] are often used interchangeably, as are the terms Adolescent Health and Youth Health. Young people's health is often complex and requires a comprehensive, biopsychosocial approach.

==Key adolescent health risks==
Some young people engage in risky behaviours that affect their health and therefore the majority of health problems are psychosocial. Many young people experience multiple problems. These behaviours are established as a young person and go on to become the lifestyles of adults leading to chronic health problems. Social, cultural and environmental factors are all important.
Young people have specific health problems and developmental needs that differ from those of children or adults: The causes of ill-health in adolescents are mostly [[psychosocial]] rather than [[biological]]. Young people often engage in health risk behaviours that reflect the processes of [[adolescent development]]: experimentation and exploration, including using [[drugs]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]], and other risk taking that affect their physical and [[mental health]]. Adolescent health also encompasses children's and young people's sexual and reproductive health (SRH).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Health Organisation describes the leading health related problems in the age group 10 – 19 years to include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs345/en/ WHO 2017, Adolescents: health risks and solutions. Fact sheet, Updated May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Early [[pregnancy]] and childbirth
*[[HIV]]
*Other [[infectious diseases]]
*[[Mental health]] problems including [[Clinical depression|depression]] and [[suicide]]
*[[Violence]] 
*[[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]] and other drugs
*[[Injuries]] both unintentional and [[self-injury]] 
*[[Sexual health]] / [[Infectious diseases]]
*[[Malnutrition]] and [[obesity]]
*[[Exercise]] and [[Nutrition]]  
*[[Tobacco use]]
*[[Rights]] of adolescents
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Young people]] often lack awareness of the harm associated with risk behaviours, and the skills to protect themselves as well as the lack knowledge about how and where to seek help for their health concerns &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080127131706/http://www.caah.chw.edu.au/resources/#03 Chown P, Kang M, Sanci L, Newnham V and Bennett D 2008, Adolescent Health: enhancing the skills of General Practitioners in caring for young people from culturally diverse backgrounds, NSW Centre for the Advancement of Adolescent Health and Transcultural Mental Health Centre.]&lt;/ref&gt;. By intervening at this early life stage, many chronic conditions later in life can be prevented.

==Key principles in adolescent health==
[[Evidence-based]] practices include [[harm reduction]] and [[health promotion]] to intervene early in the life course and illness trajectory. Youth health is founded on [[collaborative]] approaches that address [[social justice]]. [[Youth development]] approaches include [[youth empowerment]] and [[youth participation]]. Their aim is to promote [[youth rights]], [[youth voice]] and [[youth engagement]].

== Access to quality health-care services for adolescents==
Studies about young people's access to healthcare have identified major barriers including concerns about confidentiality, practitioners attitudes and communication style, environment, availability of services, cost and the developmental characteristics of young people. Marginalised young people can have greater difficulty accessing health services&lt;ref&gt;Robards F, Kang M, Usherwood T, Sanci L, How marginalized young people access, engage with, and navigate health-care systems in the digital age: Systematic review Journal of Adolescent Health, First online Feb 2018, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2017.10.018].&lt;/ref&gt; and need support to navigate the health system.&lt;ref&gt;Robards F, Kang M, Tolley K, Hawke C, Sanci L, Usherwood T, Marginalised young people’s healthcare journeys: Professionals’ perspectives, Health Education Journal, First online Feb 2018, [https://doi.org/10.1177/0017896917752965].&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organisation 'Global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents' include: &lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/183935/1/9789241549332_vol1_eng.pdf?ua=1 WHO 2015, Global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents: a guide to implement a standards-driven approach to improve the quality of health care services for adolescents. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adolescents’ health literacy 
* Community support 
* Appropriate package of services 
* Providers’ competencies 
* Facility characteristics 
* Equity and non-discrimination 
* Standard Data and quality improvement 
* Adolescents’ participation

==Key health services for young people==
Youth Health includes [[adolescent medicine]] as a speciality, along with other primary and tertiary care services. Health services for young people include [[mental health]] services, [[child protection]], drug and alcohol services, [[sexual health]] services. [[General Practitioners]] work alongside multidisciplinary health practitioners including [[psychology]], [[social Work]] and Youth health [[nursing]] and [[school health services]]. [[Youth work]] and [[youth development]] services support and engage young people. Web based supports, such as [[Reach Out!]], provide early intervention.

Youth health services ('one-stop-shops' for young people) are specialist services providing multi-disciplinary, [[primary health care]] to young people. Focusing on engaging disadvantaged young people, they deliver flexible and unique services to young people in relaxed and comfortable youth-friendly environments. Youth health services work in partnership with other government and non-government services. Youth health services provide a range of entry-points and non-threatening services (such as creative arts, basic services such as showers and laundries, a drop in service, sports and recreational facilities), which encourage young people to connect with the service on their own terms. They also provide informal links to other support services and sectors including [[education]], [[housing]], [[financial support]] and [[legal services]], offering support to young people who are dealing with complex issues. Youth health services understand the need to respond immediately to young people’s requests for support and assistance and they share a common operating philosophy, which values [[social justice]], [[Equity (economics)|equity]], and a [[holistic]] view of young people’s health and well being.

[[Capacity building]] organisations support the Youth Health sector by providing access to information and resources, conducting research and providing training.

The '''American Society for Nutrition''' (ASN) is an American society for professional researchers and practitioners in the field of [[nutrition]]. ASN publishes four journals in the field of nutrition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nutrition.org/publications/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been criticized for its financial ties to the food and beverage industry.&lt;ref name="EatDrink Politics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eng&gt;{{Cite web| last = Eng| first = Monica| title = Should Coke sponsor nutrition research?| work = WBEZ| accessdate = 2018-08-23| url = https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/do-big-food-companies-have-too-much-sway-over-nutrition-research/43df1b4d-259b-4d15-a85f-59b77232068d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1928 a group of United States biochemists and physiologists grouped together to form the first scientific society focused on nutrition, the American Institute for Nutrition. The Society held its first meeting at the [[Cornell Medical School]] in 1934.   The society was renamed the American Society for Nutritional Sciences in 1996.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt University Medical Center"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/diglib/sc_diglib/americansociety/index.html | title=The Nutrition Society Celebrates Its 75th Anniversary | publisher=Vanderbilt University Medical Center | accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the American Society for Nutritional Sciences, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition (established 1961);  and the Society for International Nutrition (established 1996) merged to form The American Society for Nutrition (ASN).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

ASN currently (2015) has a membership of about 5,000.  It is one of the constituent societies comprising the  [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]], a non-profit organization that is the principal umbrella organization of U.S. societies in the field of biological and medical research.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt University Medical Center"/&gt;

In October 2010, the [[American College of Nutrition]] and American Society for Nutrition proposed to merge.&lt;sup&gt;[[American College of Nutrition#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2018}}

==="Smart Choices" program===
The ASN administered the "[[Nutritional rating systems#Smart Choices Program|Smart Choices"]] food labelling program,&lt;ref name"smart choice"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = MacVean| first = Mary| title = 'Smart Choice' food label: a sign of nutrition or marketing?| work = Los Angeles Times| date = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was suspended in 2009 after criticism.&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Neuman| first = William| title = ‘Smart Choices’ Food Labeling Loses Support| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-24| date = 2009-10-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/24food.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
ASN publishes four academic journals. Both publisher and some editorial staff accept funding from food industry organizations.&lt;ref name="EatDrink Politics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eng/&gt;

== Corporate relationship concerns ==
The ASN has [[conflicts of interest|conflicting interests]] in taking funding from food industry marketing groups while providing unbiassed information on nutrition; these conflicting interests have caused criticism and concerns of bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = O’Connor| first = Anahad| title = Coca-Cola Funds Scientists Who Shift Blame for Obesity Away From Bad Diets| work = Well| accessdate = 2018-03-24| date = 2015-08-09| url = https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mustain_2015&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.nutres.2016.10.006| issn = 0271-5317| volume = 36| issue = 11| pages = 1183–1192| last1 = Rucker| first1 = Robert B.| last2 = Rucker| first2 = Michael R.| title = Nutrition: ethical issues and challenges| journal = Nutrition Research| accessdate = 2018-03-31|date=November 2016| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0271531716302081}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASN actions have also been criticized for being better-aligned with the nutritional advice of sponsors than the advice of the [[World Health Organization]] and other public health, public interest, and government organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bellatti| first = Andy| title = OPINION: Industry-funded nutrition groups shouldn’t dictate health policy| accessdate = 2018-03-31| date = 2015-06-24| url = http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/6/industry-funded-nutrition-groups-shouldnt-dictate-health-policy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Mustain| first1 = Patrick| last2 = Mustain| first2 = Patrick| title = Science for Sale: Big Food's Influence on Top Nutrition Research Org| work = Scientific American Blog Network| date = June 15, 2015 |accessdate = 2018-03-31| url = https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/food-matters/science-for-sale-big-food-s-influence-on-top-nutrition-research-org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bartholin gland carcinoma''' is an uncommon type of [[malignancy]] in the [[Bartholin gland]] that accounts for 1% of all [[vulva cancer|vulvar malignant neoplasms]].  It is most common in women in their mid-60s. The [[tumor]] can become large before a woman is aware of [[symptom]]s. One of the first symptoms can be [[dyspareunia]]. In other instances a woman may find a mass or [[ulcer]] in the vulva area. Many clinicians assume that an enlarged Bartholin gland is malignant in postmenopausal woman until proven otherwise. The growth of the tumor can spread to nearby areas such as the [[ischiorectal fossa]] and [[inguinal lymph nodes]]. Approximately 50% of bartholin gland carcinomas originate from [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s. Another uncommon characteristic of Bartholin gland malignancies is that the growth of a lesion originates from the three types of epithelial tissue present in the gland: [[mucinous]], [[Transitional epithelium|transitional]], and [[squamous]].&lt;ref name="HellerBean2014"/&gt;

==Cause==
{{Empty section|date=February 2018}}
==Diagnosis==
Bartholin gland can be differentiated by histology to determine whether the malignancy is due to squamous cell carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, or adenocarcinomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Donato|first=Violante|last2=Casorelli|first2=Assunta|last3=Bardhi|first3=Erlisa|last4=Vena|first4=Flaminia|last5=Marchetti|first5=Claudia|last6=Muzii|first6=Ludovico|last7=Panici|first7=Pierluigi Benedetti|title=Bartholin gland cancer|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1040842816302645|journal=Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology|volume=117|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.critrevonc.2017.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Management==
Though Bartholin gland carcinoma is rare, along with other unusual Bartholin gland growths, it many not be the typical practice for clinicians to consider lesions malignant. Early diagnosis can help to prevent the cancer from the glands to surrounding. Though malignancies of the Bartholin gland are rare clinicians biopsy Bartholin gland lesions in older women or when the growth reoccurs or does not respond to original treatment.&lt;ref name="HellerBean2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heller|first1=Debra S.|last2=Bean|first2=Sarah|title=Lesions of the Bartholin Gland|journal=Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease|volume=18|issue=4|year=2014|pages=351–357|issn=1089-2591|doi=10.1097/LGT.0000000000000016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--PMID unavailable  --&gt;

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is optimistic as long as the growth has not metastasized to the lymph nodes.&lt;ref name="HellerBean2014"/&gt;
&lt;!--Epidemiology: factors such as incidence, prevalence, age distribution, and sex ratio.--&gt;

==History==
Bartholin glands were described in cattle by Casper Barthlin in 1677. Their existence in humans was postulated at that time.&lt;ref name="HellerBean2014"/&gt; 
&lt;!--Society and culture: This might include social perceptions, cultural history, stigma, economics, religious aspects, awareness, legal issues, notable cases--&gt;
&lt;!--Research directions: Include only if addressed by significant sources.--&gt;
&lt;!--Special populations, such as Geriatrics or Pregnancy or Pediatrics--&gt;
&lt;!--Other animals--&gt;
Treatment can be a [[vulvectomy]] that results in the removal of the growth along with an extensive removal of adjacent tissue. An inguinal lymphadenectomy often accompanies the vulvectomy. The tissue that is removed sometimes includes sections of the [[vagina]] and [[rectum]].&lt;ref name="Phillip Saia 2012"&gt;Clinical gynecologic oncology, Phillip Saia, editor.

The [[Adenoid cystic carcinoma]] of the Bartholin gland is another uncommon malignancy with symptoms that include local painful intermittent recurrences. The disease is slow to progress but it can result in lung cancer after a long time after the initial treatment. Treatment consists of surgical removal of the growth. Sometimes radiation and chemotherapy is performed.&lt;ref name="Phillip Saia 2012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1305">'''Biomedical technology''' broadly refers to the application of [[engineering]] and [[technology]] principles to the domain of living or biological [[system]]s. Usually inclusion of the term ''biomedical'' denotes a principal emphasis on problems related to human health and diseases, whereas terms like "biotechnology" can be medical, environmental, or agricultural in application. But most terms in this general realm still lack clear boundaries. [[Biomedical engineering]] and [[Biotechnology]] alike are often loosely called ''Biomedical Technology'' or [[Bioengineering]]. The Biomedical technology field is currently growing at a rapid pace. Required jobs for the industry expect to grow 23% by 2024, and with the pay averaging over $86,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Biomedical_Technology.html|title=What Is Biomedical Technology?|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calvin C.J. Sia''' (born '''Calvin Chia Jung Sia''' on June 3, 1927) is a [[primary care]] pediatrician from [[Hawaii]] who developed innovative programs to improve the quality of medical care for children in the United States and Asia. Two particular programs have been implemented throughout America: the [[Medical home|Medical Home]] concept for primary care that has been promoted by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.aap.org/member/spotlight-sia.htm |title=AAP MEMBER SPOTLIGHT |publisher=Aap.org |accessdate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810031640/http://www2.aap.org/member/spotlight-sia.htm |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palfrey"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZuVbzss5WoC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Child Health in America|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal [[Emergency Medical Services for Children]] program administered by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]’ [[Health Resources and Services Administration]], [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309048885|title=Emergency Medical Services for Children|publisher=Nap.edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Medical Home model for pediatric care and early childhood development began to take root in several Asian countries in 2003.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp3/pdf/AUSPIII_FinalReport.pdf |format=PDF|title=Asia-US Partnership 2006: Early Child Development in Primary Care |date=2006|publisher=Department of Pediatrics, John A.

Sia is also creator of Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program to prevent child abuse and neglect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/3/e317.abstract|title=Hawaii's Healthy Start Home Visiting Program: Determinants and Impact of Rapid Repeat Birth|author=Samer S. El-Kamary|publisher=Pediatrics.apapublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of Hawaii's Zero to Three program and Healthy and Ready to Learn Center. The Hawaii Healthy Start program, which targets expecting and new parents who may be at risk of abusing or neglecting their children, became the model for the Healthy Families America home visiting program that the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Justice Programs]] identified in 2010 as a "promising" approach to child abuse prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=200 |title=Program: Healthy Families America |publisher=CrimeSolutions.gov |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Healthy and Ready to Learn Center was a three-year pilot project to initiate training and health delivery services in an integrated system of care, with pediatric residents and graduate students in social work and early childhood education working as a team.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clas.uiuc.edu/fulltext/cl00910/cl00910.html|title=CLAS: Building Bridges: Lessons Learned in Interprofessional Collaboration|publisher=Clas.uiuc/edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Sia spearheaded the creation of the Variety School for learning disabled children, a Honolulu-based educational institution for children ages 5 through 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varietyschool.org/about.html|title=Variety School of Hawaii|publisher=Varietyschool.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sia retired from his Honolulu-based medical practice in 1996, after almost 40 years of treating patients,&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/96/10/30/news/story2.html|title=The godfather and the grandfather|last=Altonn|first=Helen|date=October 30, 1996|website=|publisher=Archives.starbulletin.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continues to promote Medical Home and community pediatrics as professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Hawaii]] [[John A.

==Education==
Sia is a 1945 graduate of [[Punahou School]] in [[Honolulu]] and a graduate of [[Dartmouth College]] in 1950. He received his medical degree at [[Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] in 1955 and did a general rotating internship as a lieutenant in the [[U.S. Army Medical Corps]] at [[William Beaumont Army Hospital]] in El Paso, Texas from 1955-1956. Sia then served his pediatric residency under Dr. Irvine McQuarrie at Kauikeolani Children's Hospital in Honolulu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/90/3/419|title=Abraham Jacobi Award Address, April 14, 1992 The Medical Home: Pediatric Practice and Child Advocacy in the 1990s|publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained his license to practice medicine in Hawaii in 1958. He was certified by the American Board of Pediatrics in 1960 and recertified in 1987. The [[University of Hawaii]] awarded Sia an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/offices/bor/honorary.php|title=Honorary degrees conferred by the University of Hawaii|publisher=Hawaii.edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==

===Early years===
As a young practicing pediatrician, Sia joined the early cadre of American Academy of Pediatrics consultants for Head Start and Parent Child Centers in Hawaii in the 1960s and developed a strong interest in prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal causes of physical and mental disabilities in children. In a paper he presented in 1964 to the Hawaii Academy of Sciences on advances in neonatology, Sia cited progress in the care of premature babies but also noted that "completeness" of the first physical exam and the education of nurses to be on the alert for early signs of disabilities were possible ways to save newborns with previously lethal birth defects. He concluded by observing, "One of the basic problems will be in solving the causes and prevention of prematurity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sia|first=Calvin C.J.|date=1964|title=Advances in neonatology|url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/2159/PHAS1964.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Hawaiian Academy of Science|volume=|pages=16-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by one of his mentors, Dr. Robert E. Cooke, the Johns Hopkins pediatrician behind the creation of the Hopkins hospital's Kennedy Institute for Handicapped Children, Sia helped establish Hawaii's Variety School for Learning Disabilities in 1967 and served as chairman of its board of directors for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiaap.org/pdfs/AAP%20Member%20Spotlight%20Article%20-%20Sia_HS%203%202010_1_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calvin C.J. Sia, MD, FAAP - Resume |publisher=Hawaiiaap.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sia broadened the scope of his community work to address all children with special health care needs. In the early 1970s, he invited Dr. [[C. Henry Kempe]], founder of the Denver-based National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect, and Dr. Ray E. Helfer of Michigan—two pioneers in the identification and treatment of child abuse—to help him and a small group of child advocates develop a plan to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/hawaiihs.txt |format=TXT |title=Helping to Prevent Child Abuse -- and Future Criminal Consequences: Hawai'i Healthy Start |publisher=Ncjrs.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That effort netted one of the first 12 demonstration grant awards by the newly created National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1975, with $1 million going to establish the first Hawaii Family Stress Center. The center, later renamed the Hawaii Family Support Center, established several child abuse and neglect programs on Oahu, including a home-visiting program based on Kempe's effective use of "lay therapists." These were home visitors from the community, properly trained and supervised by public health nurses and social workers who could earn the trust of at-risk families and focus on family strengths to reduce environmental risk and prevent child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=49&amp;articleid=246&amp;sectionid=1609|title= - The Future of Children -|author=Princeton University|publisher=Futureofchildren.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;The Future of Children (Princeton University-Brookings Institution), Home Visiting: Recent Program Evaluations, "Evaluation of Hawaii's Healthy Start Program," by Anne K. Duggan, Sc.D, et al., Vol. 9 No. 1, Spring-Summer 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The center's goal was to identify vulnerable families before their day-to-day stresses, isolation, and lack of parenting knowledge and good role models gave rise to abusive and neglectful behavior.

The center's operations coincided with an effort launched by Dr. Vince L. Hutchins and Dr. Merle McPherson of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau in 1977 to revise and update the
mission of the federal agency's Title V and companion "crippled children's" programs to address child development and the prevention of developmental, behavioral and psychosocial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fv-ncfpp.org/index.php/download_file/view/465/95/ |format=PDF |title=Celebrate 2010 |publisher=Fv-ncfpp.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson took note of Sia's call for a continuous system of care originating with the primary care pediatrician.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.long|title=History of the Medical Home Concept|work=aappublications.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP collaborated in this effort by asking each state’s AAP chapter to develop a Child Health Plan that set priorities for using MCHB block grants. Sia spearheaded the Hawaii planning effort, bringing together representatives from the Hawaii AAP Chapter, the UH medical school, the Hawaii Medical Association, and [[Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children]]. Armed with anecdotal evidence showing home visitors were able to promote
effective parenting and ultimately improve outcomes, the group wrote a plan that incorporated a coordinated system of care that emphasized wellness and prevention for
children, especially those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/iycjournal/Abstract/2003/10000/Building_Medical_Homes_for_Children_With_Special.6.aspx|title=Building Medical Homes for Children With Special Health Care... : Infants &amp; Young Children|work=LWW|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the birth of the Medical Home concept for primary care,&lt;ref&gt;[http://facm.unjbg.edu.pe/revistaspediatria/Clinical%20Pediatrics/2009/August/16%20The%20Medical%20Home-Improving%20Quality%20of%20Primary%20Care%20for%20Children.pdf] {{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Sia attached the slogan, “Every Child Deserves a Medical Home.” Under this idea, which the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] adopted as a policy statement in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/110/1/184|title=The Medical Home|work=aappublications.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medical care of all infants, children and adolescents should be accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amchp.org/AboutAMCHP/Newsletters/Pulse/Archive/2010/April2010/Pages/article.aspx|title=From the Presidents|publisher=Amchp.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be delivered or directed by well-trained physicians who provide primary care and help to manage and facilitate essentially all aspects of pediatric care. The physician should be known to the child and family and should be able to develop a partnership of mutual responsibility and trust with them. As Sia and his co-authors of a 2006 monograph on the Medical Home noted, this new model broadens the traditional focus on acute care to include prevention and well care at one end of the continuum and chronic care management of children with special health care needs at the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aap.org/commpeds/CPTI/MedicalHome2006.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/node/33969|title=The Medical Home and Early Child Development in Primary Care|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027080143/http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/node/33969|archivedate=October 27, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One expert observed, for example, that for a child born with [[spina bifida]], Sia's Medical Home model would have the family and its health care provider compose a list of specialists and therapists who would be caring for the child and a timeline of anticipated surgeries and interventions. The aim would be to have as few emergencies and unanticipated events as possible.&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt;

As the lead author of an often-cited article published by the journal [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] in May 2004, Sia traced the development of the Medical Home concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.long|title=History of the Medical Home Concept|author=Calvin Sia|publisher=Pedriatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilot programs===
By 1984, Sia had begun to implement the Medical Home concept in Hawaii. As chairman of an ad hoc state legislative task force on child abuse, he persuaded Hawaii lawmakers to authorize the Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; This state-funded pilot program, carried out by Hawaii Family Support Center in collaboration with the Hawaii Department of Health, focused on a neighborhood in the Ewa community on Oahu, a community with relatively high rates of child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt; A year later, he spearheaded the Hawaii Medical Association's effort to obtain a grant from the U.S. [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]], under the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://perfdata.hrsa.gov/mchb/mchreports/LEARN_More/Block_Grant_Program/block_grant_program.asp|title=Block Grant Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115044032/https://perfdata.hrsa.gov/mchb/mchreports//LEARN_More/Block_Grant_Program/block_grant_program.asp|archivedate=January 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train primary care physicians to provide a "Medical Home" for all children with special health care needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=History of the Medical Home Concept |publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration project—which sought to help first-time families give their newborn children the best start in life—was so successful it was expanded from a small part of [[Oahu]] to other areas of Hawaii, and as word of the demonstrated positive outcomes spread, Hawaii’s Healthy Start became a model for parenting education programs nationwide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; In the early 1990s, Healthy Families America and the National Healthy Start Association began to standardize and credential programs to ensure effectiveness and research-based practices. Across the United States, according to the MCHB, the home visiting program has shown that it can reduce child maltreatment and increase children’s readiness for school.

Meanwhile, Sia launched the Hawaii Early Intervention Program for infants and toddlers in 1986 and also became actively involved with Hawaii’s Early Intervention Coordinating Council for Zero to Three, placing this under Hawaii’s Department of Health instead of the Department of Education.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  The focus of this effort was to support the Medical Home system of care with prevention and early intervention programs.

===Implementation===
At a June 1987 conference called by [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]] and sponsored by the AAP and MCHB to address children with special needs, Sia and his delegation from Hawaii made a presentation of the Medical Home concept. Koop appeared to embrace it by issuing a report that endorsed a system of family-centered, community-based, coordinated care for children with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/83/6/1055|title=Family-Centered, Community-Based, Coordinated Care for Children With Special Health Care Needs|author=Earl J. Brewer Jr|publisher=Pedriatics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1989 by the first National Medical Home Conference, which drew 26 AAP state chapters to Hawaii for presentations organized by Sia and MCHB officials on how to train pediatricians in the Medical Home system of care. This led to consultations to introduce the Medical Home training program to interdisciplinary teams of pediatricians, families, and other health care–related professionals in Florida, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Washington and other states.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The pace of activity prompted Sia to close his private medical practice in 1996 so he could devote his time as principal investigator on various early childhood grant projects promoting the Medical Home and its integrated system of care. He launched several initiatives with a MCHB Health Education Collaboration grant in support of interprofessional training in early childhood, a [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] Starting Points planning grant in early childhood, and Consuelo Foundation of Hawaii's Healthy and Ready to Learn grant–all with the emphasis on integrating the continuum of care of the Medical Home with other health, family, and community services from a holistic approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; The MCHB funding enabled him to travel across the country to promote the Medical Home concept to various
communities, state AAP chapters, family advocacy groups and state Title V maternal and child health officers.

A three-year pilot project creating a Healthy and Ready to Learn Center in Hawaii began in 1992 and helped gauge the effectiveness of Sia's family-centered interprofessional collaboration approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Lessons learned from this project were subsequently adopted by the Office of Children and Youth of the Governor's Office of Hawaii with Sia as Co-Principal Investigator.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; The Carnegie Corp. Starting Points grant then was assumed by the Good Beginnings Alliance in Hawaii.

Sia, serving as chairman of the American Medical Association's Section Council on Pediatrics and other AMA- and AAP-related posts, used those platforms and his network of contacts with other groups to help introduce the Medical Home concept into the care of adults&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/391/1177/EvidenceReport208_ClosingTheQualityGap-Patient-Centered-Medical-Home_ExecutiveSummary_20120703.pdf |format=PDF |title=2. The Patient-Centered Medical Home Closing the Quality Gap: Revisiting the State of the Science : Executive Summary |publisher=Effectibvehealthcare.ahrq.gov |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as children, although his primary focus has remained on pediatric care. In 2007, the AAP, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] adopted the Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home that set a standard definition of a Medical Home. A year later, the AMA adopted the principles, which have since received support from over 700 member organizations of the [[Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative]], including primary care and specialty care societies, all major health plans and consumer organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccp.org/publications/pdf/text_1041.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pediatric Medical Homes : Laying the Foundation of a Promising Model of Care |publisher=Nccp.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the term Medical Home now regularly shows up in the literature of parent groups such as Family Voices, in family practice journals and on the websites of state public health and medical agencies.&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt;

===Focus on Asia===

Beginning in 2000, Sia expanded his efforts related to early child development and the Medical Home to Asia. In 2003, he created the Asia-US Partnership, a think tank based at the University of Hawaii medical school whose mission is to improve child health in Asia and the United States through cross-cultural
exchanges with leaders in pediatrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp1/pdf/AUSP1_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Early Child Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Sia initiated and chaired the first of several AUSP Early Child Development and Primary Care conferences, bringing together pediatric and early childhood development experts from Asia and the United States to translate the science of early child development into policy and action. Participants have come from China (Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong), the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand and the United States. According to conference reports, these international exchanges have stimulated translation of the science on early child development and primary care into action programs in the broad areas of advocacy, service delivery, research, and training among the Asian early childhood professionals leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Sia has continued to serve as co-chairman of these events, including the sixth international conference, held in the Philippines capital of Manila, in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp6/pdf/AUSPVI_BriefingBook.pdf |format=PDF |title=Briefing Book : Asia-US Partnership 2011 : Early Childhood Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hosting the earliest AUSP conferences in Hawaii, Sia decided to move the 2009 event to Shanghai and tapped a team of Chinese doctors to serve as conference host, signaling what he called a new phase of activity aimed at developing greater shared leadership and stronger "country teams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp5/pdf/AUSPV_FinalReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Asia-US Partnership 2011 : Early Childhood Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pediatric emergency medicine===
While planting the seeds of the Medical Home concept in Hawaii, Sia embarked on a related advocacy campaign focused on emergency care for children. In 1979, as president of the Hawaii Medical Association, Sia urged members of the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop multifaceted Emergency Medical Services programs designed to decrease disability and death in children. By January 1981, AAP's Executive Board had approved formation of a Section on Emergency Medicine, with Sia as one of its seven charter members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.aap.org/sections/pem/25AnniversaryBookletFinal.pdf |format=PDF |title=The AAP Section on Emergency Medicine |publisher=2.aap.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He along with José B. Lee then-executive officer of the Hawaii Medical Association Emergency Medical Services Program began working closely with Senator [[Daniel Inouye]], whom he happened to meet on a flight to Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt; to create a National Emergency Medical Services for Children System ([[Emergency Medical Services for Children|EMSC]]) demonstration grant program to address acute injuries, illnesses and other childhood crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oDI8Rxe34U8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=Calvin%20Sia&amp;f=false|title=APLS : the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was launched after the October 1984 enactment of EMSC legislation (Public Law 98-555), a bipartisan measure sponsored by Inouye and Republican Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] of Utah and [[Lowell Weicker]] of Connecticut and endorsed by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/nysdoh/ems/emsc/index.htm|title=Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC)|publisher=Health.ny.gov|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/EMSC_An_Historical_Perspective.pdf|title=EMSC: an historical perspective|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203204651/http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/EMSC_An_Historical_Perspective.pdf|archivedate=February 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; States receiving these demonstration grants established an emergency medical care service system for children that upgraded training and equipment for first responders and emergency departments to treat children. Hawaii ultimately received a grant to initiate its own emergency care system for children, which improved care coordination with the primary care physician. EMSC is now an established statewide system of care for children in all 50 states and territories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Carbonless copy paper''' ('''CCP'''), '''non-carbon copy paper''', or '''NCR paper''' (No Carbon Required, taken from the initials of its creator, [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register]]) is a type of [[coated paper]] designed to transfer information written on the front onto sheets beneath. It was developed by chemists Lowell Schleicher and Barry Green,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appletonideas.com/pdf/Lowell_Schleicher_Dies.pdf |title=Carbonless Paper Pioneer Lowell Schleicher Dies |publisher=Appletonideas.com |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112210954/http://www.appletonideas.com/pdf/Lowell_Schleicher_Dies.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to [[carbon paper]] and is sometimes misidentified as such.

Instead of inserting a special sheet in between the original and the intended copy, carbonless copy paper has [[micro-encapsulation|micro-encapsulated]] dye or ink on the back side of the top sheet, and a clay coating on the front side of the bottom sheet. When pressure is applied (from writing or impact printing), the dye capsules rupture and react with the clay to form a permanent mark duplicating the markings made to the top sheet. Intermediary sheets, with clay on the front and dye capsules on the back, can be used to create multiple copies; this may be referred to as multipart stationery.

== Operation ==
Carbonless copy paper consists of sheets of paper that are [[coated paper|coated]] with [[micro-encapsulation|micro-encapsulated]] dye or ink or a reactive clay. The back of the first sheet is coated with micro-encapsulated dye (referred to as a Coated Back or CB sheet). The lowermost sheet is coated on the top surface with a clay that quickly reacts with the dye to form a permanent mark (Coated Front, CF). Any intermediate sheets are coated with clay on top and dye on the bottom (Coated Front and Back, CFB).

When the sheets are written on with pressure (e.g., ball-point pen) or impact (e.g., typewriter, [[Dot matrix printer|dot-matrix printer]]), the pressure causes the micro-capsules to break and release their dye. Since the capsules are so small, the resulting print is very accurate.

Carbonless copy paper was also available in a self-contained version that had both the ink and the clay on the same side of the paper.

== Uses ==
Carbonless copy paper was first produced by the [[NCR Corporation]], applying for a patent on June 30, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|2730457|Pressure responsive record materials|Inventors: Green, Barrett K.; Schleicher, Lowell. Applicant: The National Cash Register Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use [[carbon paper]], which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the copy. Carbonless paper was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The copies were often paper of different colors (e.g., white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless copy paper can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as [[continuous stationery]] for printers designed to use it.

== Dyes and chemicals ==
The first dye used commercially in this application was [[crystal violet lactone]], which is widely used today. Other dyes and supporting chemicals used are PTSMH (''p''-toluene sulfinate of Michler's hydrol), TMA ([[trimellitic anhydride]]), phenol-formaldehyde resins, [[azo dye]]s, DIPN ([[diisopropyl naphthalene]]s), [[formaldehyde isocyanate]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]-based [[solvent]]s, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, [[polyoxypropylene diamine]], [[epoxy resin]]s, aliphatic [[isocyanate]]s, [[Bisphenol A]], [[diethylene triamine]], and others. The dyes in carbonless copy papers may cause [[contact dermatitis]] in sensitive persons.

== Health and environmental concerns ==
Until the 1970s, when the use of [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) was banned due to health and environmental concerns, PCBs were used as a transfer agent in carbonless copy paper.&lt;ref name="devoogt1984"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=de Voogt P |author2=Klamer J C |author3=Brinkman U A Th |title=Identification and quantification of polychlorinated biphenyls in paper and paper board using fused silica capillary gas chromatography |journal=Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |volume=32 |issue=1 |date=December 1984 |pages=45–52 | doi=10.1007/BF01607463 |pmid=6421348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karatsune1972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuratsune M, Masuda Y|title=Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Non-carbon Copy Paper |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=1 |pages=61–62 |date=April 1972 |pmid=17539088 |doi=10.2307/3428153 |pmc=1474878 |publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 1 |jstor=3428153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NPL Site Narrative for Fox River NRDA/PCB Releases |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/nar1515.htm |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCBs are readily transferred to human skin during handling of such papers, and it is difficult to achieve decontamination by ordinary washing with soap and water.&lt;ref name="karatsune1972" /&gt; In Japan, carbonless copy paper is still treated as a PCB-contaminated waste.&lt;ref name="envjapan"&gt;{{cite web |title=Invitation of proposals concerning to PCB contaminated solid wastes treatment technologies |publisher=''Hyogo Prefectural Environment Create Center Public Corporation'' |date=January 27, 2003 |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/recycle/ill_dum/pcb/index.html | accessdate=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to certain types of carbonless copy paper or its components has resulted, under some conditions, in mild to moderate symptoms of skin irritation and irritation of the mucosal membranes of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. A 2000 review found no irritation or sensitization on contact with carbonless copy paper produced after 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Carbonless copy paper and workplace safety: a review |vauthors=Graves CG, Matanoski GM, Tardiff RG |journal=[[Regul Toxicol Pharmacol]] |year=2000 |volume=32 |number=1 |pages=99–117 |pmid=11029273| doi=10.1006/rtph.2000.1408}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, good industrial hygiene and work practices should be adequate to reduce or eliminate symptoms. These include adequate ventilation, humidity, and temperature controls; proper housekeeping; minimal hand-to-mouth and hand-to-eye contact; and periodic cleansing of hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ccp/ |title=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – Carbonless Copy Paper |accessdate=October 13, 2007 |publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 study, the University of Florida found that a poorly-ventilated office where large amounts of carbonless copy paper were used had significant levels of volatile organic compounds present in its air, whereas a well-ventilated office where little such paper was used did not. The study also found that there were higher rates of sick leave and illness complaints at the office using large amounts of carbonless copy paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meisenheimer|first1=Karen|title=Scientists Test Carbonless Copy Paper For Sickening Side Effects|url=http://news.ufl.edu/archive/1997/05/scientists-test-carbonless-copy-paper-for-sickening-side-effects.html|website=University of Florida News|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, which was published in ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', connected chronic occupational exposure to paper dust and carbonless copy paper with an increased risk of adult-onset asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaakkola |first=Maritta S. |author2=Jouni J.K.

The Spanish Biomedical Research Centre in Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición: '''CIBERObn''') is a public [[research]] consortium which was founded on November 28, 2006 financed by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) and the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MICINN).

The '''CIBERObn''' gathers 31 investigation groups from different Spanish Hospitals, Universities and Research Centres. Its mission is to promote a better knowledge about the mechanisms contributing to [[obesity]] development in order to reduce its incidence and prevalence, as well as its complications, in addition to [[nutrition]]-related diseases. 

The '''CIBERObn''' is structured into 8 scientific programs intended to increase the collaboration between researchers, to strengthen synergies and to boost new research lines. Programs are as follows: 

# '''Nutrition''': effects of different types of diet and nutrients on [[human health]].
# '''Adipobiology''': identification of new signals released by the [[adipose tissue]] which are involved in the regulation of [[energy homeostasis]].
# '''Obesity and Cancer''': role of those proteins associated with [[cell cycle]] on metabolic control and obesity development.
# '''Obesity and Cardiovascular risk''': hemodynamic, metabolic and inflammatory factors associated to cardiac and vascular diseases in obesity.
# '''Neurocognitive and Environmental Factors''': environmental and emotional factors in nutrition and obesity disorders.
# '''Obesity in Childhood-Adolescence Period''': biochemical, hormonal, metabolic, genetic, proteomic and body-composition study in children and adolescents.
# '''Biomarkers''': new strategies, therapeutic and prevention technologies, [[biomarker]]s of obesity.
# '''Biological Models and Therapeutic Targets''': development and validation of experimental models and therapeutic targets in case of obesity.

Additionally, CIBERObn lays a particular emphasis on [[translational research]], specially focusing on research transfer to clinical applications and practices. To this end, two cross-cutting programs have been created: 
* '''Staff Training and Recruitment''', which is intended to train our staff according to our research lines and priorities
* “'''Fat Bank'''” Structural Program: [[biobank]] infrastructure connecting the above-mentioned programs in a cross way by contributing with common solutions.

The Fat Bank is a strategic platform of the CIBERObn which offers the Scientific Community different kinds of biological material which are associated to thorough metabolic [[phenotyping]]. This information is entered by means of a tailor-made individualised software. This fat-bank- launched in 2009- currently contains 3000 samples of biologic material from more than 300 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundosalud/2011/07/12/corazon/1310490938.html|title=Nace el primer biobanco español de tejido adiposo {{!}} Corazón {{!}} elmundo.es|last=Internet|first=Unidad Editorial|website=www.elmundo.es|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, 287 indexed articles were published. Their average [[impact factor]] is 4.05, which is very high for this subject area. Of them, 67 (23%) belong to the first decile and 105 more (total 172 papers, 60%) belong to the first quartile of the subject area of indexed journals. They accumulate a total impact factor of 1,165. Provisional data of 2010 show an increase of 10%, highly improving the international visibility of the consortium.

A '''clinical coder''' – also known as '''clinical coding officer''', '''diagnostic coder''', '''medical coder''', '''nosologist'''  or '''medical records technician''' – is a [[Health information management|health information professional]] whose main duties are to analyse [[medical record|clinical statements]] and assign standard codes using a [[medical classification|classification system]]. The data produced are an integral part of [[health information management]], and are used by local and national governments, private healthcare organizations and international agencies for various purposes, including medical and health services research, [[epidemiology|epidemiological studies]], health resource allocation, [[case mix]] management, [[public health]] programming, [[medical billing]], and public education.

For example, a clinical coder may use a set of published codes on medical diagnoses and procedures, such as the [[ICD-10|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) or the [[HCPCS|Common Coding System for Healthcare Procedures]] (HCPCS), for reporting to the [[health insurance]] provider of the recipient of the care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to Health Insurance Billing|author=Marie A. Moisio|year=2000|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1207-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author = Michelle A. Green and JoAnn C. Rowell
  |title = Understanding Health Insurance, A Guide to Billing and Reimbursement, 10e
  |publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]
  |year = 2011
  |isbn = 978-1-111-03518-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The use of standard codes allows insurance providers to map equivalencies across different service providers who may use different terminologies or abbreviations in their written claims forms, and be used to justify reimbursement of fees and expenses. The codes may cover topics related to [[Diagnostic code|diagnoses]], [[Procedure code|procedures]], [[pharmaceutical code|pharmaceuticals]] or [[Topographical code|topography]]. The medical notes may also be divided into specialities for example [[cardiology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[nephrology]], [[neurology]] , [[pulmonology]] or [[orthopedic]] care.

A clinical coder therefore requires a good knowledge of [[medical terminology]], [[anatomy and physiology]], a basic knowledge of clinical procedures and diseases and injuries and other conditions, medical illustrations, clinical documentation (such as medical or surgical reports and patient charts), legal and ethical aspects of health information, health data standards, classification conventions, and computer- or paper-based data management, usually as obtained through formal education and/or on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. ''Classifying health workers: Medical records and health information technicians''. Geneva, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;Department of Human Services, Victoria, Australia. [http://www.dhs.vic.gov.au/ahs/archive/hdss/13-19720.htm#clinical Clinical Coders Creed.] ''Health Data Standards and Systems Bulletin'', Issue 13, 19 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
The basic task of a clinical coder is to classify medical and health care concepts using a standardised [[medical classification|classification]]. Most clinical coders are employed in coding [[inpatient]] episodes of care.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, [[Death|mortality]] events, [[outpatient]] episodes, [[general practitioner]] visits and [[population health]] studies can all be coded.

Clinical coding has three key phases: a) Abstraction; b) Assignment; and c) Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wooding A |title=Clinical coders and decision making |journal=HIM J |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=79–83 |year=2004 |pmid=18490784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstraction===
The abstraction phase involves reading the entire record of the [[reason for encounter|health encounter]] and analysing the information to determine what condition(s) the patient had, what caused it and how it was treated. The information comes from a variety of sources within the [[medical record]], such as clinical notes, laboratory and radiology results, and operation notes.

===Assignment===
The assignment phase has two parts: finding the appropriate code(s) from the classification for the abstraction; and entering the code into the system being used to collect the coded data.

===Review===
Reviewing the code set produced from the assignment phase is very important. Clinical coder must ask themselves, "does this code set fairly represent what happened to this patient in this health encounter at this facility?" By doing this, clinical coders are checking that they have covered everything that they must, but not used extraneous codes. For health encounters that are funded through a [[case mix]] mechanism, the clinical coder will also review the [[diagnosis-related group]] (DRG) to ensure that it does fairly represent the health encounter.

==Competency levels==
Clinical coders may have different competency levels depending on the specific tasks and employment setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker S |title=Capturing health information—a perspectives paper |journal=HIM J |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=13–22 |year=2006 |pmid=18195424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entry-level / trainee coder===
An entry level coder has completed (or nearly completed) an introductory training program in using clinical classifications. Depending on the country; this program may be in the form of a certificate, or even a degree; which has to be earned before the trainee is allowed to start coding. All trainee coders will have some form of continuous, on-the-job training; often being overseen by a more senior coder. 

===Intermediate level coder===
An intermediate level coder has acquired the skills necessary to code many cases independently. Coders at this level are also able to code cases with incomplete information. They have a good understanding of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] along with disease processes. Intermediate level coders have their work audited periodically by an Advanced coder.

===Advanced level / senior coder===
Advanced level and senior coders are authorized to code all cases including the most complex. Advanced coders will usually be credentialed and will have several years of experience. An advanced coder is also able to train entry-level coders.

===Nosologist===
{{main|Nosology}}
A nosologist understands how the classification is underpinned. Nosologists consult nationally and internationally to resolve issues in the classification and are viewed as experts who can not only code, but design and deliver education, assist in the development of the classification and the rules for using it.

Nosologists are usually expert in more than one classification, including morbidity, mortality and casemix. In some countries the term "nosologist" is used as a catch-all term for all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-11/nosologist Nosologist.] ''Popular Science'', posted 11.11.2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification types==
Clinical coders may use many different classifications, which fall into two main groupings: statistical classifications and nomenclatures.

===Statistical classification===
{{Main|Medical classification|Procedural classification}}

A statistical classification, such as ICD-10 or [[DSM-5]], will bring together similar clinical concepts, and group them into one category. This allows the number of categories to be limited so that the classification does not become too big, but still allows statistical analysis. An example of this is in [[ICD-10]] at code I47.1. The code title (or [[rubric]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems|date=2011|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241548342|page=19|edition=10th revision, 2010|ref=Footnote 1|chapter=3. How to use the ICD|quote=In the context of the ICD, "rubric" denotes either a three-character category or a four-character subcategory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Supraventricular tachycardia]]. However, there are several other clinical concepts that are also classified here. Amongst them are paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, auricular tachycardia and nodal tachycardia.

===Nomenclature===
With a [[nomenclature]], for example [[SNOMED CT]], there is a separate listing and code for every clinical concept. So, in the tachycardia example above, each type and clinical term for tachycardia would have its own code listed. This makes nomenclatures unwieldy for compiling health statistics.

==Education and professional qualification==
In some countries, clinical coders may seek voluntary [[Certification and Accreditation|certification or accreditation]] through assessments conducted by professional associations, health authorities or, in some instances, universities.&lt;ref name="Bramley"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bramley | first1 = M | last2 = Reid | first2 = B.  | year = | title = Evaluation standards for clinical coder training programs | url = http://www.himaa.org.au/members/journal/HIMJ_36_3_2007/Bramey%20and%20Reid%20Evaluation%20standards%20for%20clinical%20coder%20training%20programs.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Health Information Management Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 3| page = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The options available to the coder will depend on the country,&lt;ref name="Bramley" /&gt; and, occasionally, even between states within a country.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===United Kingdom===
Clinical coders start as trainees, and there are no conversion courses for coders [[immigration|immigrating]] to the [[United Kingdom]].

The [[National Clinical Coding Qualification (UK)|National Clinical Coding Qualification]] (NCCQ) is an exam for experienced coders, and is recognised by the four health agencies of the UK.

&lt;!-- Countries have been listed in the order they appear in paragraph two of the lead section at the United Kingdom article --&gt;
====England====
In [[England]], a novice coder will complete the national standards course written by [[NHS Digital]] within 6 months of being in post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Clinical Coding Training Handbook 2016-17|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160921135209/http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/data/clinicalcoding/trainingaccred/sc_rc_hbk1617.pdf#page=3|publisher=Clinical Classifications Service|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will then start working towards the NCCQ. 

Three years after passing the NCCQ, two further professional qualifications are made available to the coder in the form of NHS Digital's clinical coding auditor and trainer programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delen: Home: CLINICAL CODING AUDITOR PROGRAMME|url=https://hscic.kahootz.com/connect.ti/t_c_home/view?objectId=297779|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delen: Home: CLINICAL CODING TRAINER PROGRAMME|url=https://hscic.kahootz.com/connect.ti/t_c_home/view?objectId=297747|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In 2015, [[NHS National Services Scotland|National Services Scotland]], in collaboration with Health Boards, launched the Certificate of Technical Competence (CTC) in Clinical Coding (Scotland). Awarded by the Institute of Health Records &amp; Information Management (IHRIM); the aims of the certificate include supporting staff new to clinical coding, and providing a standardised framework of clinical coding training across NHS Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate of Technical Competence in Clinical Coding (Scotland)|url=http://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Terminology-Services/Terminology-Advice-and-Support/Publicity-20170802-CTC.PDF|website=ISD Services|publisher=NHS Scotland|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCCQ is a recognized coding qualification in [[Scotland]].

===United States===
As of 2016; the typical qualification for an entry-level medical coder in the United States is completion of a diploma or certificate, or, where they are offered, an associate degree. The diploma, certificate, or degree will usually always include an Internet-based and/or in-person [[internship]], at some form of a medical office or facility, at the conclusion. Some form of on-the-job training, or at least oversight, is also usually provided in the first months on the job, until the coder can earn an intermediate or advanced level of certification and accumulate time on the job. For further academic training, a baccalaureate or master's degree in medical information technology, or a related field, can be earned by those who wish to advance to a supervisory or academic role. That option would be recommended for those wishing to teach medical billing or coding at a college or university, community college, or technical or vocational institute, or who wish to become heads of medical billing and coding departments, especially if the doctor's office or clinic, or other facility (among other working options, a medical school or hospital, a skilled nursing facility or other nursing home, a psychiatric facility, an assisted or independent living facility, a rehabilitation facility, a rest home or domiciliary or boarding house, etc.) is very large and receives complex cases, such as a referral facility or a Level I trauma teaching hospital center. A [[nosologist]] (medical coding expert) in the U.S. will usually be certified by either AHIMA or the AAPC (often both) at their highest level of certification and specialty inpatient and/or outpatient certification (pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, gerontology, oncology are among those offered by AHIMA and/or the AAPC), have at least 3-5 years of intermediate experience beyond entry-level certification and employment, and often holds an associate, bachelor's, or graduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://icc.edu/academics/catalog/health-careers/medical-coder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midstate.edu/programs/healthinformationtechnology.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midwesttech.edu/Program-Description/medical-coder-course-description.html&lt;/ref&gt;   

The [[AAPC (healthcare)|AAPC]] offers the following entry-level certifications in the U.S.: Certified Professional Coder (CPC); which tests on most areas of medical coding, and also the Certified Inpatient Coder (CIC) and Certified Outpatient Coder (COC). Also in the [[American Health Information Management Association]] (AHIMA) offers the entry-level Certified Coding Associate (CCA); which is, like the AAPC's CPC, a wide-ranging introductory test.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} 

Some U.S. states, though decidedly not the majority, as it is a very recent trend, now mandate or at least strongly encourage certification or a degree from a college- or at the minimum, some evidence of competency beyond the record of on the job training- and/or from either the AAPC or AHIMA, to be employed. Some states have registries of medical coders, though these can be voluntary listings- which is, for those few who do, most often the case- and so not mandatory. This trend was accelerated in part by the passage of [[HIPAA]] (which enforces among other things, patient privacy and access to and the form of medical records) and the [[Affordable Care Act]] (U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s health care reform law); and similar changes in other developed and developing countries, many of which, especially in the Western developed countries, and beyond, use the [[ICD-10]] for diagnostic medical coding, which is a quite complex system of codes. The change to more regulation and training has also been driven by the need to create accurate, detailed, and secure medical records- especially patient charts, bills, and claim form submissions, that can be recorded efficiently in an electronic era of medical records where they need to be carefully shared between different providers or institutions of care, which was encouraged and later required by legislation and institutional policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/federal-requirements-medical-billing-companies-3069.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mb-guide.org/medical-billing-laws.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/medical_billing_pros.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/prof_advance.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.net/medical_billing_schools.htm?pc=&amp;sub=medbilling&amp;qual=associate&amp;ct=either&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Professional associations==
In many countries clinical coders are accommodated for by both professional bodies specific to coding, and organisations who represent the health information management profession as a whole.

IHRIM are the awarding body for the National Clinical Coding Qualification (NCCQ).

===United States===
There are several associations that medical coders in the United States may join, including:
*[[American Health Information Management Association]] (AHIMA)&lt;ref name=ahima&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahima.org/ |title= AHIMA Home - American Health Information Management Association |access-date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[AAPC (healthcare)|AAPC]] (formerly American Academy of Professional Coders)

The AHIMA and AAPC societies' accredited programs will generally train medical coders at a sufficient level to work in their respective states. Some medical coders elect to be certified by both societies.  

AHIMA maintains a list of accredited medical coding certificate (and health information management associate, bachelor's, and graduate programs, through a link on the AHIMA accredited programs page, to [[CAHIIM]]) here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahima.org/careers/codingprograms&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disease mongering''' is a term for the practice of widening the diagnostic boundaries of illnesses and aggressively promoting their public awareness in order to expand the markets for treatment. 
Among the entities benefiting from selling and delivering treatments are [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]], physicians, [[alternative medicine|alternative practitioners]] and other professional or consumer organizations. It is distinct from the promulgation of [[List of questionable diseases|bogus or unrecognised diagnoses]].

==Term==
The term “[[Peddler#Types and names|monger]]” has ancient roots, providing the basis for many common compound forms such as cheesemonger, [[fishmonger]], and [[fleshmonger]] for those who peddle such wares respectively.  “Disease mongering” as a label for the "invention" or promotion of diseases in order to capitalize on their treatment was first used in 1992 by health writer Lynn Payer, who applied it to the [[Listerine]] mouthwash campaign against [[halitosis]] (bad breath).

Payer defined disease mongering as a set of practices which include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Payer|first=Lynn|title=Disease-mongers : how doctors, drug companies, and insurers are making you feel sick|year=1992|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0471543855
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Stating that normal human experiences are abnormal and in need of treatment
* Claiming to recognize suffering which is not present
* Defining a disease such that a large number of people have it
* Defining a disease's cause as some ambiguous deficiency or [[hormonal imbalance]]
* Associating a disease with a public relations [[Spin (public relations)|spin]] campaign
* Directing the framing of public discussion of a disease
* Intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misusing statistics]] to exaggerate treatment benefits
* Setting a dubious [[clinical endpoint]] in research
* Advertising a treatment as without [[side effect]]
* Advertising a common symptom as a serious disease

The incidence of conditions not previously defined as illness being [[medicalisation|medicalised]] as "diseases" is difficult to scientifically assess due to the inherent social and political nature of the definition of what constitutes a disease, and what aspects of the human condition should be managed according to a medical model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frosch DL, Grande D, Tarn DM, Kravitz RL |title=A decade of controversy: balancing policy with evidence in the regulation of prescription drug advertising |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=24–32 |date=January 2010  |pmid=19910354 |pmc=2791253 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2008.153767 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, halitosis, the condition which prompted Payer to coin the phrase "disease mongering", isn't merely an imagined social stigma but can stem from any of a wide spectrum of conditions spanning from bacterial infection of the gums to kidney failure, and is recognized by the Scientific Council of the American Dental Association as "a recognizable condition which deserves professional attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nypediatricdds.com/Portals/0/Oral_Malodor_2012.pdf|title=nypediatricdds.com|format=|website=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018063249/http://nypediatricdds.com/Portals/0/Oral_Malodor_2012.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Australian journalist Ray Moynihan has argued that the pharmaceutical industry engages in disease mongering to enlarge its profits, and that it harms patients.&lt;ref name=Moynihan1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moynihan R, Heath I, Henry D |title=Selling sickness: the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering |journal=[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] |volume=324 |issue=7342 |pages=886–91 |year=2002 |pmid=11950740 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7342/886 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.886 |pmc=1122833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His use of osteoporosis as an example of a "made up" disease in this article prompted an angry retort from the president of the British National Osteoporosis Society, stating that the article was insulting to people with osteoporosis and vastly understated the risk of disabling fractures associated with the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edwards L |title=The pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering.

== Development ==
EQ-5D was first introduced in 1990 by the EuroQol Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EuroQol Group|date=1990-12-01|title=EuroQol--a new facility for the measurement of health-related quality of life|journal=Health Policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)|volume=16|issue=3|pages=199–208|issn=0168-8510|pmid=10109801|doi=10.1016/0168-8510(90)90421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group was initially formed in 1987 with the researchers of multidisciplinary areas from five European countries; Netherlands, UK, Sweden, Finland, and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euroqol.org/about-eq-5d/working-paper-series/file/EuroQol_Working_Paper_Series_Manuscript_15003_-_Richard_Brooks_01.pdf.html|title=28 Years of the EuroQol Group: An Overview|last=Brooks|first=Richard|date=December 2015|website=EQ-5D|publisher=EuroQol Research Foundation|access-date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked cooperatively with the aim of developing an instrument which is not specific to disease but standardized and can be used as a complement for existing [[Quality of life (healthcare)|health-related quality of life]] (HRQoL) measures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euroqol.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/PDF/Folders_Flyers/EQ-5D-3L_UserGuide_2015.pdf|title=EQ-5D-3L User Guide|last=Reenen|first=Mandy van|date=April 2015|website=EQ-5D|publisher=EuroQol Research Foundation|access-date=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabin|first=R.|last2=de Charro|first2=F.|date=2001-07-01|title=EQ-5D: a measure of health status from the EuroQol Group|journal=Annals of Medicine|volume=33|issue=5|pages=337–343|issn=0785-3890|pmid=11491192|doi=10.3109/07853890109002087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other required characteristics of the new instrument were capable of being sent as a postal questionnaire for self-completion, easy to complete, applicable to everyone, can produce a single index value, and can take into account the health status ‘worse than dead’.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Components ==
The EQ-5D questionnaire is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in "work, study, housework, family or leisure activities". In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.

In evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the [[visual analogue scale]] (EQ-VAS).

=== Descriptive system ===

====EQ-5D-3L====
When EQ-5D was first developed, the scale used in the health state description part was three-level; having no problems, having some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as "I have no problems in walking about", "I have some problems in walking about", and "I am confined to bed". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). 12321 indicates having no problems in mobility and anxiety/depression, having slight problems in self-care and pain/discomfort, and having extreme problems in usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) different health states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 'youth version' of the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system was developed for self-completion by children and younger people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wille|first=Nora|last2=Badia|first2=Xavier|last3=Bonsel|first3=Gouke|last4=Burström|first4=Kristina|last5=Cavrini|first5=Gulia|last6=Devlin|first6=Nancy|last7=Egmar|first7=Ann-Charlotte|last8=Greiner|first8=Wolfgang|last9=Gusi|first9=Narcis|date=2010-04-20|title=Development of the EQ-5D-Y: a child-friendly version of the EQ-5D|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-010-9648-y|journal=Quality of Life Research|language=en|volume=19|issue=6|pages=875–886|doi=10.1007/s11136-010-9648-y|issn=0962-9343}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes equivalent dimensions to the original EQ-5D-3L, phrased so as to be more easily understood and relevant for younger people. The dimensions are: 'mobility', 'looking after myself', 'doing usual activities', 'having pain or discomfort' and 'feeling worried, sad or unhappy'.

==== EQ-5D-5L ====
Although its brevity contributed a lot for the wide use of EQ-5D, the three-level scale showed some limitations. The major drawback is that it has much fewer descriptive capability of health status compared to other generic instruments. For example, the [[Health Utilities Index]] Mark 2 and Mark 3 (HUI 2 and HUI 3) and the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) can define 24,000, 972,000, and 18,000 unique health states, while EQ-5D-3L can do only 243.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a consequence, it suffers from ceiling and flowing effect and showed low sensitivity to catch small changes of health status especially when used to patients with milder conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herdman|first=M.|last2=Gudex|first2=C.|last3=Lloyd|first3=A.|last4=Janssen|first4=Mf|last5=Kind|first5=P.|last6=Parkin|first6=D.|last7=Bonsel|first7=G.|last8=Badia|first8=X.|date=2011-12-01|title=Development and preliminary testing of the new five-level version of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L)|journal=Quality of Life Research: An International Journal of Quality of Life Aspects of Treatment, Care and Rehabilitation|volume=20|issue=10|pages=1727–1736|doi=10.1007/s11136-011-9903-x|issn=1573-2649|pmc=3220807|pmid=21479777}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve such constraints of the three-level scale, the new version of EQ-5D with five-level scale was developed (EQ-5D-5L).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euroqol.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/PDF/Products/Sample_UK__English__EQ-5D-5L_Paper_Self_complete_v1.0__ID_24700_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The number of levels of severity was increased to five in this new version; having no problems, having slight problems, having moderate problems, having severe problems and being unable to do/having extreme problems. The new version can define 3,125 (=5&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) different health states. Some of the wordings of the scale were revisited to be clearer and the instruction for EQ-VAS was simplified. No changes were made for the five dimensions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The validity and reliability of the EQ-5D have been assessed for the different language versions and various health conditions, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, COPD, asthma, and cardiovascular disease, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Hout|first=Ben|last2=Janssen|first2=M.

EQ-5D-5L has also been recommended to the elderly population as a generic health status measurement, in combination with other supplementary measurements to capture all related aspects in their quality-of-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bulamu|first=Norma B.|last2=Kaambwa|first2=Billingsley|last3=Ratcliffe|first3=Julie|date=2015-11-09|title=A systematic review of instruments for measuring outcomes in economic evaluation within aged care|url=http://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12955-015-0372-8|journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s12955-015-0372-8|pmc=4640110|pmid=26553129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) ===
Visual analogue scale is the second part of the questionnaire, asking to mark health status on the day of the interview on a 20&amp;nbsp;cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. There are notes at the both ends of the scale that the bottom rate (0) corresponds to " the worst health you can imagine", and the highest rate (100) corresponds to "the best health you can imagine".  In the EQ-5D-3L version, the respondents has to draw a line from the box on the questionnaire to the scale indicates the health state of the interviewed day, while the EQ-5D-5L version asks to mark X on the scale to indicate the today's health and write the number of the scale marked in the empty box on the questionnaire.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A well-known limitation of visual analogue scale is end-of-scale bias that respondents are less likely to use the extreme ends of the scale for rating their health status. However, it is still useful and the simplest direct method for valuing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) weights.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=Sarah J.|last2=Ali|first2=Shehzad|date=2010-01-01|title=Health outcomes in economic evaluation: the QALY and utilities|journal=British Medical Bulletin|volume=96|pages=5–21|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldq033|issn=1471-8391|pmid=21037243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Valuation process ==
Once the health status is assessed from the description part, the 5-digit number can be converted into a preference weight which is also referred to as a single weighted index score. It can be done by using methods for generating HRQoL weights, such as visual analogue scale (VAS), the [[time-trade-off]] (TTO), and the standard gamble (SG). The choice of the valuation methods can vary. The initial purpose of having visual analogue scale in the EQ-5D questionnaire was to get preference weights using the scale, but the time-trade-off has become favored because it is a "choice task", not a "rating task" which easily involves some scaling bias.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Time-trade-off is recommended when performing cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as an outcome, but other methods could be chosen for different type of analyses. A value set was developed using time-trade-off in many countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Spain, Japan, and Germany.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The index score of a value set derived from the general population sample can be regarded as a "''societal'' valuation of the respondent's health state" in that country. In contrast, the scores from the visual analogue scale in the questionnaire indicates the respondent's ''own'' assessment of his/her health status".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0233-1_2|title=Guidelines for analysing and reporting EQ-5D outcomes|last=Krabbe|first=Paul|last2=Weijnen|first2=Tom|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048162611|editor-last=Brooks|editor-first=Richard|pages=7–19|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0233-1_2|editor-last2=Rabin|editor-first2=Rosalind|editor-last3=Charro|editor-first3=Frank de}}&lt;/ref&gt; A value set derived from the general population sample has been criticized for a lack of a compelling theoretical support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandjour|first1=Afschin|title=Theoretical Foundation of Patient v.

It has been estimated that over 20% of adults suffer from some form of [[sleep deprivation]].&lt;ref name="Hublin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hublin | first1 = C | last2 = Kaprio | first2 = J | last3 = Partinen | first3 = M | last4 = Koskenvuo | first4 = M.  | year = 2001 | title = Insufficient sleep: a population-based study in adults | url = https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-pdf/24/4/392/13661692/sleep-24-4-392.pdf | journal = Sleep | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 392–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insomnia]] and sleep deprivation are common symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and can be an indication of other [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Diagnostic"&gt;Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV.

== Attention ==

=== Neural substrates ===
[[Image:Parietal lobe.gif|250px|left|alt=the Parietal lobe highlighted in human brain.|''[[Parietal lobe]]'']] 
The [[parietal lobe]]s of the brain are largely involved in [[attention]]. [[Lesion]]s to this region of the brain in humans result in difficulty or inability to attend to events that are [[contralateral]] to the lesioned [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]. Those with lesions to the posterior parietal lobe have little to no difficulty shifting attention to and from [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] appearing in the space [[ipsilateral]] to the lesioned hemisphere. However, they do display a slowed response in shifting their focus of current attention to events and stimuli appearing contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = A. | last2 = Rafal | first2 = R. D. | year = 1991 | title = Attention and Feature Integration | url = | journal =  Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 106–110 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1991.tb00109.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies involving [[single-unit recording]]s from the parietal lobes of monkeys have indicated that there are [[neuron]]s solely involved in integrating visual spatial information with postural information. Without this apparent combining of spatial information, it would be difficult or impossible to locate objects in external space, as information provided solely by the [[retina]] is insufficient. The position of the eyes, head and body must also be taken into consideration.

In addition, studies involving [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] application over the parietal lobes as well as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) analysis of the parietal lobes suggest that this region is involved in conjunction searches, but not in single-feature searches.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, J. (2006). Space, Attention and the Parietal Lobes. The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York, NY: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Visual search]] for supplementary information.)

=== Auditory attention ===
[[Image:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|right|alt=This shows the primary auditory cortex and the surrounding regions it communicates with.|The [[Primary auditory cortex]] is highlighted in magenta, and has been known to interact with all areas highlighted on this neural map.]]
[[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]] attention has been examined following sleep deprivation. Researchers examined the auditory attention of twelve non-sleep-deprived subjects and twelve sleep-deprived subjects at various time intervals. Subjects were involved in an auditory attention task, which required the reproduction of the spatial relationships between four letters, using a graph composed of six squares, immediately following the presentation of an item from a tape recorder. It was found that auditory attention of sleep-deprived individuals is affected as the total amount of sleep-deprivation increases, possibly due to lowered perceptual vigilance.&lt;ref name="Linde"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linde | first1 = L. | last2 = Edland | first2 = A. | last3 = Bergstrom | first3 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Auditory attention and multiattribute decision-making during a 33-h sleep deprivation period: mean performance and between-subject dispersions | url = | journal = Ergonomics | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 696–713 | doi=10.1080/001401399185397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divided attention ===

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) scans of the brains of subjects exposed to thirty-five hours of sleep deprivation indicate that sleep deprivation is related to increases in [[prefrontal cortex]] and parietal lobe activation during tasks that combine verbal learning and arithmetic. This is particularly apparent in the right hemisphere. In non sleep-deprived individuals involved in verbal learning and arithmetic tasks the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the right prefrontal cortex are active. Following sleep deprivation there is increased activation of the left [[inferior frontal gyrus]] and the [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] parietal lobes. This information suggests that divided attention tasks require more attentional resources than normally required by a non sleep-deprived individual.&lt;ref name="Drummond"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drummond | first1 = S. P. A. | last2 = Gillin | first2 = J. C. | last3 = Brown | first3 = G. G. | year = 2001 | title = Increased cerebral response during a divided attention task following sleep deprivation | url = | journal = European Sleep Research Society | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 85–92 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00245.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exogenous and endogenous attention ===

Studies utilizing [[event-related potential]] (ERP) recordings have found that twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation decreases ERP response to signal inputs from [[endogenous]], but not [[exogenous]], sources. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep deprivation affects endogenously driven selective attention to a greater extent than exogenously driven selected attention.&lt;ref name="Trujillo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trujillo | first1 = L. T. | last2 = Kornguth | first2 = S. | last3 = Schnyer | first3 = D. M. | year = 2009 | title = An ERP examination of the different effects of sleep deprivation on exogenously cued and endogenously cued attention | url = https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/32/10/1285/2454430 | journal = Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research | volume = 32 | issue = 10| pages = 1285–1297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selective attention ===

Twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation has been found to affect the functional connectivity between the inferior frontal parietal region (IPS) and the [[parahippocampal place area]] (PPA). However, sleep deprivation does not affect the attention modulation index of the PPA. With this information, researchers have concluded that the [[psychophysiological]] interaction (PPI) is more involved in selective attention than the IPS and PPA.&lt;ref name="Chee"&gt;Chee, M. W. L., Tan, J. C., Parimal, S. &amp; Zagoradnov, V. (2009). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.493.2042&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Sleep deprivation and its effects on object-selective attention]. Neuroimage, 1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that together, attention and sleep deprivation modulate the parahippocampal place area (PPA) activation and scene processing. Specifically, sleep deprivation was related to significant decreases in PPA activation while attending to scenes and when ignoring scenes. This is explained by the absence of change in the Attention Modulation Index (AMI). Face recognition is not affected by sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name="Chee"/&gt;

Sleep deprivation has been shown to negatively affect picture classification speed and accuracy, as well as [[recognition memory]].&lt;ref name="Chee"/&gt; It results in an inability to avoid attending to irrelevant information displayed during attention-related tasks. (Norton) It also decreases activation in the ventral visual area and the frontal parietal control regions.&lt;ref name="Chee"/&gt;

=== Supervisory attention ===

Studies involving sleep deprived subjects’ performance on choice reaction time tests, in which [[Reactive inhibition|response inhibition]], task shifting skill and task strategy were involved, have been conducted and analyzed. These three cognitive processes are involved and critical in tasks involving supervisory attention, which is defined as behaviour that arises through the selection and implementation of schemas.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt; Following one night of total sleep deprivation, subjects showed no decline in task shifting or response inhibition performance. However, sleep deprivation does affect the ability to use preparatory bias to increase performance speed. It is suggested that the brain’s cognitive resources make an active effort to succeed in a challenging task when subjected to sleep deprivation, and that this deficit becomes apparent in tasks involving preparatory bias.&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jennings | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Monk | first2 = T. H. | last3 = der Molen | first3 = M. W. | year = 2003 | title = Sleep deprivation influences some but not all processes of supervisory attention | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 473–479 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visuospatial attention ===

Deficits in cognitive performance due to continuous sleep restriction are not well understood. However, there have been studies looking into physiological arousal of the sleep-deprived brain. Participants, whose total amount of sleep had been restricted by 33% throughout one week, were subjected to reaction time tests. The results of these tests were analyzed using quantitative [[EEG]] analysis. The results indicate that the frontal regions of the brain are first to be affected, whereas the parietal regions remain active until the effects of sleep deprivation become more severe, which occurred towards the end of the week. In addition, [[EEG]] and ERP analysis reveals that activation deficits are more apparent in the non-dominant hemisphere than in the dominant hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cote"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cote | first1 = K. A. | last2 = Milner | first2 = C. E. | last3 = Osip | first3 = S. L. | last4 = Baker | first4 = M. L. | last5 = Cuthbert | first5 = B. P. | year = 2008 | title = Physiological arousal and attention during a week of continuous sleep restriction | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 353–364 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.06.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Brain chrischan thalamus.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Diagram showing the Thalamus.| ''[[Thalamus]]''.]]
The effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance have been studied through the use of parametric visual attention tasks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of participants' brains who were involved in ball-tracking tasks of various difficulty levels were obtained. These images were taken during rested wakefulness and again after one night of sleep deprivation. The [[thalamus]] is more highly activated when accompanied by sleep deprivation than when the subject is in a state of rested wakefulness. Contrarily, the thalamus is more highly activated during difficult tasks accompanied by rested wakefulness, but not during a state of sleep deprivation. Researchers propose that the thalamic resources, which are normally activated during difficult tasks, are being activated in an attempt to maintain alertness during states of sleep deprivation. In addition, an increase in thalamic activation is related to a decrease in the parietal, prefrontal and [[cingulate cortex]] activation, resulting in the overall impairment of attentional networks, which are necessary for visuospatial attention performance.&lt;ref name="Tomasi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomasi | first1 = D. | last2 = Wang | first2 = R. L. | last3 = Telang | first3 = F. | last4 = Boronikolas | first4 = V. | last5 = Jayne | first5 = M. C. | last6 = Wang | first6 = G. J. | last7 = Fowler | first7 = J. S. | last8 = Volkow | first8 = N.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that the [[posterior cingulate]] (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex are involved in the anticipatory allocation of spatial attention. When sleep-deprived, PCC activity decreases, impairing selective attention. Subjects were exposed to an attention-shifting task involving spatially informative, misleading and uninformative cues preceding the stimuli. When sleep-deprived, subjects showed increased activation in the left [[intraparietal sulcus]]. This region is activated when exposed to stimuli in unexpected locations. These findings suggest that sleep-deprived individuals may be impaired in their ability to anticipate the locations of upcoming events. In addition, inability to avoid attending to irrelevant events may also be induced by sleep-deprivation.&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin | first1 = R. G. | year = 2008 | title = Sleep deprivation alters functioning within the neural network underlying the covert orienting of attention | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.04.030 | journal = Brain Research | volume =  1217| issue = | pages = 148–156 | pmid=18511023 | pmc=2528837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, other studies have indicated that the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance, specifically, sustained visual attention, are more global and [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] in nature, as opposed to more lateralized deficit explanations. In a study utilizing the Choice Visual Perception Task, subjects were exposed to stimuli appearing in various locations in visual space. Results indicate that sleep deprivation results in a general decline in visual attention. It is also suggested that the sleep-deprived brain is able to maintain a certain level of cognitive performance during tasks requiring divided attention by recruiting additional cortical regions that are not normally used for such tasks.&lt;ref name="Kendall"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendall | first1 = A.

The processes above illustrate a model of controlled versus automatic behavior that was hypothesized by Shallice et al. (1989), called the [[supervisory attentional system]]. This system is believed to come into play when intervention of habitual response is necessary.&lt;ref name="Shallice"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shallice | first1 = T. | last2 = Burgess | first2 = P.W. | last3 = Baxter | first3 = D.M. | last4 = Schon | first4 = F. | year = 1989 | title = The origins of utilisation behaviour | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 1587–98 | doi=10.1093/brain/112.6.1587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to the prefrontal cortex will cause a breakdown in this system, resulting in [[utilization behavior]]s.&lt;ref name="Shallice" /&gt; These behaviors would include spontaneous sequences of action on irrelevant objects in the surroundings with no clear goal in mind.&lt;ref name="Shallice" /&gt; This theory has helped to extend the knowledge we now have on executive functions.

=== Decision making ===

[[Decision making]] involves a range of executive functions that need to be combined and organized in order to respond in the most appropriate manner, i.e. respond with the most advantageous decision.&lt;ref name="Harrison, Y., Horne, J.A. (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = Y. | last2 = Horne | first2 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = One night of sleep loss impairs innovative thinking and flexible decision making | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 128–145 | doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2827}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many aspects to the process of decision making, including those discussed above. Other processes involved that correlate to executive function will be discussed below.

=== Complexity ===

While most important decisions are made over a longer period of time involving more in-depth cognitive analysis, usually we have limited time in which to assimilate a large amount of information into an informed decision. Lack of sleep appears to negatively affect our ability to appreciate and respond to increasing complexity, as was found in performance deficits after 1 night of sleep deprivation on a simulated marketing game.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;

The game involved subjects promoting a fictional product while getting feedback on the financial effects of their decisions. They would continuously have to take into account new variables to succeed which would increase the game's complexity.&lt;ref name="Harrison, Y., Horne, J.A. (1999)"/&gt;

Other examples of inability to process complex information includes a decrease in ability to assess facial expressions, an increase in resolving to the use of stereotypes and racial biases in evaluations, and an increase in taking the easier solution to solving interpersonal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Amie M.|last2=Mendes|first2=Wendy Berry|last3=Prather|first3=Aric A.|date=2017-09-27|title=The Social Side of Sleep: Elucidating the Links Between Sleep and Social Processes|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721417712269|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|pages=0963721417712269|doi=10.1177/0963721417712269|issn=0963-7214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation ===

Intuitively, because sleep deprivation had a negative effect on handling  the complexity of the simulated marketing game, it also affected innovative processes as subjects failed to adopt a more innovative (and rewarding) style of play.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt; Innovative thinking involves the construction of new behaviors based on the assimilation of continuously changing or novel information. In a study of military personnel who had undergone two nights of sleep deprivation, results showed marked reductions in the ability to generate ideas about a given topic (categories test); this is known as ideational fluency.&lt;ref name="May"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = May | first1 = J. | last2 = Kline | first2 = P. | year = 1987 | title = Measuring the effects on cognitive abilities of sleep loss during continuous operations | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 443–455 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1987.tb02261.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MRI of orbitofrontal cortex.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Approximate location of the orbitofrontal cortex.|Approximate Location of the ''[[Orbitofrontal cortex]]''.]]

=== Risk ===

Risk versus reward analysis is an important part of decision making. Attempting to create a representation and response to a risky situation highly involves the [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Pais-Vieira"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pais-Viera | first1 = M. | last2 = Lima | first2 = D. | last3 = Galhardo | first3 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Orbitofrontal cortex lesions disrupt risk assessment in a novel serial decision-making task for rats | url = | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 145 | issue = 1| pages = 225–231 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.11.058 | pmid=17204373}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study that involved risk taking analysis of drivers who had been driving for 12 hours straight, it was found that they were more willing to make hazardous maneuvers and were reluctant to adopt any form of a cautious driving style.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = I.D. | last2 = Tickner | first2 = A.H. | last3 = Simmons | first3 = D.C. | year = 1970 | title = Effect of prolonged driving on overtaking criteria | url = | journal = Ergonomics | volume =  13| issue = 2| pages = 239–242 | doi = 10.1080/00140137008931137 | pmid=5432365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies shed further light on this phenomenon. One study used real life decision making scenarios involving choosing cards from 1 of 4 decks of cards. Different cards were considered as a reward while the others were a penalty. The sleep deprived subjects failed to alter their selection methods, continuing to choose cards from decks that were producing a high amount of penalty cards, whereas the control subjects were able to change their choosing strategy by a cost-benefit analysis based on monitoring the outcomes they were getting as they went along.&lt;ref name="Harrison, Y., Horne, J.A. (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = Y. | last2 = Horne | first2 = J.A. | year = 1998 | title = Sleep loss impairs short and novel language tasks having a prefrontal focus | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2869.1998.00104.x | journal = Journal of Sleep Research | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 95–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planning ===

The process of planning would be done congruently with decision making in determining the outcome behavior. As has been shown so far, sleep deprivation has many detrimental effects on executive functions and planning is not spared. One study involved cadets who were required to complete simulated military operations under sleep deprived conditions. Results showed a decrease in the subjects ability to 'plan on the fly' and overall outcomes were less than those for well rested cadets.&lt;ref name="McCann"&gt;McCann, C., Pointing, T. (1995) The effect of alerting drugs on planning performance during sustained operations. Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine, North York, Ontario, Canada. Retrieved onon November 19, 2009 from http://cradpdf.drdc.gc.ca/PDFS/zbb55/p506693.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another psychological test used to assess planning and decision making is the [[Tower of London test]]. This test has been widely used in the testing of executive functions as well as studies of sleep deprived subjects. In a study examining performance on this test after 45–50 hours of sleep deprivation, it was found that the sleep deprived subjects not only took longer, but required more moves to complete the task than did the controls.&lt;ref name="Killgore"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Killgore | first1 = W.D. | last2 = Kahn-Greene | first2 = E.T. | last3 = Grugle | first3 = N.L. | last4 = Killgore | first4 = D.B. | last5 = Balkin | first5 = T.J.  | year = 2009 | title = Sustaining executive functions during sleep deprivation: A comparison of caffeine, dextroamphetamine, and modafinil | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 205–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Error correction ===

Being able to show insight into one's performance on different tasks and correct or modify those behaviors if they are incorrect is an important part of executive functioning. The problems that could be associated with being unable to learn from a mistake or adapt to a mistake could impair many behaviors.

A common test used to assess error correction and trouble shooting with regards to the frontal lobe is the [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]]. This test involves a change in the rules which requires a shift in strategy. In the same study discussed above,&lt;ref name="Killgore" /&gt; detriments were also found on this task in the sleep deprived individuals.

== Memory ==

Research evidence suggests that sleep is involved in the acquisition, maintenance and retrieval of memories&lt;ref name="Rauchs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rauchs | first1 = G. | last2 = Desgranges | first2 = B. | last3 = Foret | first3 = J. | last4 = Eustache | first4 = F. | year = 2005 | title = The relationships between memory systems and sleep stages | url = | journal = Journal of Sleep Research | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 123–140 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.2005.00450.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[memory consolidation]].&lt;ref name="Saxvig"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saxvig | first1 = I. W. | last2 = Lundervold | first2 = A. J. | last3 = Gronli | first3 = J. | last4 = Ursin | first4 = R. | last5 = Bjorvatn | first5 = B. | last6 = Portas | first6 = C. M. | year = 2007 | title = The effect of a REM sleep deprivation procedure on different aspects of memory function in humans | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 309–317 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00623.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, sleep deprivation has been shown to affect both working memory and [[long-term memory]] processes.

=== Working memory ===

Sleep deprivation increases the number of errors made on working memory tasks. In one study, the working memory task involved illuminating a sequence of 3 or 4 coloured lights, then asking both sleep deprived and non-sleep deprived individuals to memorize and repeat back the sequence. The sleep deprived performed the task much faster than those in the control condition (i.e., not sleep deprived), which initially appeared to be a positive effect. However, there was a significant difference in the number of errors made, with the fatigued group performing much worse.&lt;ref name="Kahol"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahol | first1 = K. | last2 = Lebya | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Deka | first3 = M. | last4 = Deka | first4 = V. | last5 = Mayes | first5 = S. | last6 = Smith | first6 = M. | last7 = Ferrara | first7 = J. J. | last8 = Panchanathan | first8 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Effect of fatigue on psychomotor and cognitive skills | url = | journal = The American Journal of Surgery | volume = 195 | issue = | pages = 195–204 | doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from imaging studies also demonstrates the influence of sleep deprivation on working memory. [[EEG]] studies have documented lower accuracy and slower reaction times among sleep deprived participants performing working memory tasks. Decreasing alertness and lack of focus triggered deficits in working memory that are accompanied by significant degradation of [[event-related potentials]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = M. E. | last2 = McEvoy | first2 = L. K. | last3 = Gevins | first3 = A. | year = 2002 | title = The impact of moderate sleep loss on neurophysiologic signals during working-memory task performance | url = https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-pdf/25/7/56/13661849/sleep-25-7-56.pdf | journal = Sleep | volume = 25 | issue = 7| pages = 784–794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PET scans shows global decrease in glucose metabolism in response to sleep deprivation. As subjects become increasingly impaired on working memory tasks, a more specific decrease of glucose occurs in the thalamus, prefrontal cortex and [[posterior parietal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Durmer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durmer | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Dinges | first2 = D. F. | year = 2005 | title = Neurocognitive consequences of sleep deprivation | url = | journal = Seminars in Neurology | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 117–129 | doi=10.1055/s-2005-867080 | pmid=15798944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

fMRI scans following brief sleep deprivation (24 hours or less) show increases in thalamic activation. Verbal working memory tasks normally cause increases in left [[temporal lobe]] activity. However, after 35 hours of deprivation, there are noted decreases in temporal lobe activation and increases in parietal lobe activation.&lt;ref name="Durmer"/&gt;
[[Image:Working memory model.svg|frame|left|alt=Diagram showing a model of working memory| ''[[Working memory]]'' model.]]
The working [[memory span]] is also affected by sleep deprivation. When sleep deprived participants in a study were asked to remember a [[nonsense word]] and locate it among a number of similar words, the length of time they could hold it in their working memory decreased by 38% compared to rested individuals.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = T. H. | last2 = Drummond | first2 = S. P. A. | last3 = Salamat | first3 = J. S. | last4 = Brown | first4 = G. G. | year = 2007 | title = Effects of 24 Hr of total sleep deprivation on component processes of verbal working memory | url = | journal = Neuropsychology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 787–795 | doi=10.1037/0894-4105.21.6.787 | pmid=17983292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term memory ===

One way sleep is involved in the creation of long-term memories is through memory consolidation, which is the process by which a new memory is changed into a more permanent form. This is believed to be accomplished by creating connections between the medial temporal lobes and neocortical areas.&lt;ref name="Rauchs"/&gt; [[NREM]] (non-REM) and [[REM sleep]] are both believed to be implicated, with current theories suggesting NREM is most particularly involved in [[procedural memory]] and REM with [[declarative memory]].&lt;ref name="Rauchs"/&gt;

Animal studies have partly validated these claims. For instance, one study conducted with rats showed that REM sleep deprivation after learning a new task disrupted their ability to perform the task again later. This was especially true if the task was complex (i.e., involved using unusual information or developing novel adaptive behaviours).&lt;ref name="Rauchs"/&gt;

There is similar evidence for the role of sleep in procedural memory in humans. Participants in one study were trained on a procedural memory skill involving perceptual-motor skills. Those who were NREM sleep deprived performed significantly worse on subsequent trials compared to those who were fully rested.&lt;ref name="Rauchs"/&gt; Another study using a visuo-motor procedural memory task documented similar results. Participants who were sleep deprived following the initial training showed no improvement on trials the next day, while those who received sleep showed significant positive changes.&lt;ref name="Gais"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gais | first1 = S. | last2 = Koster | first2 = S. | last3 = Sprenger | first3 = A. | last4 = Bethke | first4 = J. | last5 = Heide | first5 = W. | last6 = Kimmig | first6 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Sleep is required for improving reaction times after training on a procedural visuo-motor task | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 90 | issue = | pages = 610–615 | doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.07.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies such as these clearly demonstrate the disruptive influence sleep deprivation has on memory consolidation of procedural and declarative memories.

Sleep deprivation also has a documented effect on the ability to acquire new memories for subsequent consolidation. A study done on mice that were sleep deprived before learning a new skill but allowed to rest afterward displayed a similar number of errors on later trials as the mice that were sleep deprived only after the initial learning.&lt;ref name="Linden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linden | first1 = E. R. | last2 = Bern | first2 = D. | last3 = Fishbein | first3 = W. | year = 1974 | title = Retrograde amnesia: prolonging the fixation phase of memory consolidation by paradoxical sleep deprivation | url = | journal = Physiology and Behavior | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 409–412 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(75)90004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is hypothesized that rather than preventing the memory from being consolidated, sleep deprivation interfered with the initial acquisition of the memory. Mice with pre-trial sleep deprivation also took significantly longer to learn a task than well-rested mice.&lt;ref name="Alvarenga"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alvarenga | first1 = T. A. | last2 = Patti | first2 = C. L. | last3 = Andersen | first3 = M. L. | last4 = Silva | first4 = R. H. | last5 = Calzavara | first5 = M. B. | last6 = Lopez | first6 = G. B. | last7 = Frussa-Filho | first7 = R. | last8 = Tufik | first8 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Paradoxical sleep deprivation impairs acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of a discriminative avoidance task in rats | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 90 | issue = | pages = 624–632 | doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleep deprivation is also implicated in impaired ability to retrieve stored long-term memories. When an aversive stimulus was included in a trial (i.e., a blowdryer would blast hot air and noise at a mouse), mice that were sleep deprived were less anxious on subsequent trials. This suggests they had not retrieved all of the memory related to the unpleasant experience.&lt;ref name="Alvarenga"/&gt;

=== Explanations for the effect of sleep deprivation on memory ===

Several theories have been put forth to explain the effect sleep deprivation has on memory.

One early study into neurochemical influences on sleep and memory was conducted with cats and demonstrated that sleep deprivation increased brain [[protein synthesis]]. There is evidence that these altered levels of proteins could increase the excitability of the central nervous system, thus increasing the susceptibility of the brain to other neurochemical agents that can cause [[amnesia]].&lt;ref name="Linden"/&gt; Further research has revealed that the protein kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway is crucial to long-term memory. If PKA or protein synthesis inhibition occurs at certain moments during sleep, memory consolidation can be disrupted. In addition, mice with genetic inhibition of PKA have been shown to have long-term memory deficits.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graves | first1 = L. | last2 = Pack | first2 = A. | last3 = Abel | first3 = T. | year = 2001 | title = Sleep and memory: a molecular perspective | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 237–243 | doi=10.1016/s0166-2236(00)01744-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sleep deprivation may act through the inhibition of these protein synthesis pathways.

[[Acetylcholine]] (ACh) may also be involved in the effects of sleep deprivation, particularly with regards to spatial memory. Muscarinic antagonists, or chemicals that block ACh, impair spatial learning when administered prior to a training task among rats. ACh levels are also found to be lower when measured following a period of sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; ACh has also been shown to increase the activity of the PKA pathway, which is needed for memory consolidation.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt;

[[Serotonin]] levels (in the form of 5-HT) have been shown to decrease during REM and NREM sleep, leading some researchers to believe that it is also involved in memory consolidation during sleep. Mice lacking the receptor gene for 5-HT engage in more REM sleep and perform better on spatial memory tasks.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; Researchers have hypothesized that sleep deprivation interferes with the normal reduction in levels of 5-HT, impairing the process of memory consolidation.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt;

Another theory suggests that the stress brought on by sleep deprivation affects memory consolidation by changing the concentration of [[corticosteroids]] in the body. This was simulated in one study by elevating the concentration of [[glucocorticoids]] during early sleep stages. The observed effects on memory retention the next day were similar to those obtained from individuals who had received no sleep.&lt;ref name="Plihal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plihal | first1 = W. | last2 = Born | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Memory consolidation in human sleep depends on inhibition of glucocorticoid release | url = | journal = Learning and Memory | volume = 10 | issue = 13| pages = 2741–2747 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199909090-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleep deprivation may affect memory by interfering with [[neuroplasticity]] as measured by [[long-term potentiation]] in the [[hippocampus]]. This reduced plasticity may be the root cause of impairments in both working memory among humans and spatial memory among rats.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = I.

Sleep deprivation has also been associated with decreased overall membrane excitability of neurons in the brain. Activation of these membranes is critical for the formation of memories.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = R. | last2 = Hu | first2 = S. | last3 = Wang | first3 = Y. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = W. | last5 = Luo | first5 = W. | last6 = Chen | first6 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Paradoxical sleep deprivation impairs spatial learning and affects membrane excitability and mitochondrial protein in the hippocampus | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1230 | issue = | pages = 224–232 | doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2008.07.033 | pmid=18674519}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitochondria]] play an essential role in modulating neuron excitability, and research has shown that sleep deprivation is involved in inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism.&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;

==Practical effects==

===Risk of traffic collisions ===
Reduced duration of sleep, as well as an increase in time spent awake, are factors that highly contribute to the risk of [[traffic collision]]s, the severity and fatality rates of which are on the same level as [[driving under the influence]] of [[alcohol]],&lt;ref name="Pack"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pack | first1 = AI | last2 = Pack | first2 = AM | last3 = Rodgman | first3 = E | last4 = Cucchiara | first4 = A | last5 = Dinges | first5 = DF | last6 = Schwab | first6 = CW.  | year = 1995 | title = Characteristics of crashes attributed to the driver having fallen asleep | url = | journal = Accident Analysis and Prevention | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 769–775 | doi=10.1016/0001-4575(95)00034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stutts"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stutts | first1 = JC | last2 = Wilkins | first2 = JW | last3 = Osberg | first3 = JS | last4 = Vaughn | first4 = BV.  | year = 2003 | title = Driver risk factors for sleep-related crashes | url = | journal = Accid Anal Prev | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 321–331 | doi=10.1016/s0001-4575(02)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 19 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a [[blood alcohol content|BAC]] of 0.05%, and 24 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a BAC of 0.10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Dawson D, Reid K|title=Fatigue, alcohol and performance impairment|journal=Nature|year=1997|volume=388|pages=235|doi=10.1038/40775|pmid=9230429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compounding this issue is the proven dissociation between objective performance and subjective alertness; individuals vastly underestimate the effect that sleep deprivation has on their cognitive performance, particularly during the circadian night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bermudez EB, Kerman EB, Cohen DA, Wyatt JK, Czeisler CA, Phillips AJK|title= Prediction of vigilant attention and cognitive performance using self-reported alertness, circadian phase, hours since awakening, and accumulated sleep loss|journal=PLoS One|year=2016|volume=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0151770}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10059">'''Environment, health and safety''' ('''EHS''') is a discipline and specialty that studies and implements practical aspects of environmental protection and safety at work. In simple terms it is what organizations must do to make sure that their activities do not cause harm to anyone.

Regulatory requirements play an important role in EHS discipline and EHS managers must identify and understand relevant EHS regulations, the implications of which must be communicated to executive management  so the company can implement suitable measures. Organisations based in the United States are subject to EHS regulations in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], particularly CFR 29, 40, and 49. Still, EHS management is not limited to legal compliance and companies should be encouraged to do more than is required by law, if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Kavianian, Hamid R. "Occupational and Environmental Safety Engineering and Management", Van Norstrand Reinhold Company, New York (1990), {{ISBN|0-442-23822-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a '''health &amp; safety''' standpoint, it involves creating organized efforts and procedures for identifying workplace hazards and reducing accidents and exposure to harmful situations and substances. It also includes training of personnel in accident prevention, accident response, emergency preparedness, and use of protective clothing and equipment.

From an '''environmental''' standpoint, it involves creating a systematic approach to complying with environmental regulations, such as managing waste or air emissions all the way to helping site's reduce the company's carbon footprint.

Successful HSE programs also include measures to address ergonomics, [[air pollution|air quality]], and other aspects of workplace safety that could affect the health and well-being of employees and the overall community.

==History==

The [[chemical industry]] introduced the first formal [https://www.gensuite.com/ EHS management] approach in 1985 as a reaction to several catastrophic accidents (like the [[Seveso disaster]] of July 1976 and the [[Bhopal disaster]] of December 1984). This worldwide voluntary initiative, called "[[Responsible Care]]", started by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada (formerly the Canadian Chemical Producers' Association - CCPA), operates in about 50 countries, with central coordination provided by the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]] (ICCA). It involves eight fundamental features which ensure plant and product safety, occupational health and environmental protection, but which also try to demonstrate by [[image-building]] campaigns that the chemical industry acts in a responsible manner. Being an initiative of the ICCA, it is restricted to the chemical industry.

Since the 1990s, general approaches to EHS management that may fit any type of organisation have appeared in international standards such as:

* the [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme]] (EMAS), developed by the [[European Commission]] in 1993
* [[ISO 14001]] for environmental management in 1996
* [[ISO 45001]] for occupational health and safety management in 2018, preceded by [[OHSAS 18001]] 1999

In 1998 the [[International Finance Corporation]] established EHS guidelines.

The '''European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions''', (also known as ''European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions'') abbreviated '''EU-SILC''', is a survey department of the [[EU]].
It replaced in 2004 the ''European Community Household Panel'' (ECHP), which covered the years 1994-2003. The EU-SILC includes only minor changes relative to its predecessor the ECHP; most importantly, it significantly expands the number of countries included in the sample.

The [[Flynn effect]] has been often cited as an example of euthenics. Another example is the steady increase in body size in industrialized countries since the beginning of the 20th century.

Euthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not.&lt;ref name="definitionsnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/Euthenics|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Definitions for Euthenics|website=definitions.net|year=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Ellen Swallow Richards]], the first female student and instructor at MIT.]]
The term was derived in the late 19th century from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''eutheneo'', εὐθηνέω (''eu'', well; the, root of τίθημι ''tithemi'', to cause).

(To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;)

Also from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;

The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]], Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards|Ellen H. Swallow Richards]] (1842&amp;ndash;1911; Vassar Class of '70) was one of the first writers to use the term, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="askdefine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | authorlink = John K. Grandy | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if (and probably unlikely that) any of the study programs of euthenics ever completely embraced Richards' multidisciplinary concept, though several nuances remain today, especially that of [[interdisciplinarity]].

===Vassar College Institute of Euthenics===
[[File:Julia Clifford Lathrop first chief US Childrens Bureau.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Julia Clifford Lathrop as the first chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau.]]
After Richards' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932; VC '80)—one of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae—continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in euthenics at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna [[Minnie Cumnock Blodgett]] (1862–1931; VC '84), who with her husband, [[John W. Blodgett|John Wood Blodgett]], offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]]. Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar president [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923, under the direction of Professor Annie Louise Macleod (Chemistry; First woman PhD, McGill University, 1910).&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory" /&gt;

According to Vassar's chronology entry for March 17, 1924, "the faculty recognized euthenics as a satisfactory field for sequential study (major). A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary program]] [radical at the time] focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. Students in euthenics could take courses in horticulture, food chemistry, sociology and statistics, education, child study, economics, economic geography, physiology, hygiene, public health, psychology and domestic architecture and furniture. With the new division came the first major in child study at an American liberal arts college."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1924/1924-03-17-euthenics.html |title= A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a multidisciplinary program focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a typical major in child study in euthenics includes introductory psychology, laboratory psychology, applied psychology, child study and social psychology in the Department of Psychology; the three courses offered in the Department of Child Study; beginning economics, programs of social reorganization and the family in Economics; and in the Department of Physiology, human physiology, child hygiene, principles of public health.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;*{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = Helen Drusilla | authorlink = Helen Drusilla Lockwood | title = The Meaning of Euthenics; An Essay on Action as a Tool of Knowledge. | publisher = [[Vassar College]] | location = [[Poughkeepsie, NY]] | year = 1929 | isbn = | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015019910382;view=1up;seq=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vassar [[Summer Institute of Euthenics]] accepted its first students in June 1926. Created to supplement the controversial euthenics major which began February 21, 1925, it was also located in the new Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics ([[York &amp; Sawyer]], architects; ground broke October 25, 1925). Some Vassar faculty members (perhaps emotionally upset with being displaced on campus to make way, or otherwise politically motivated) contentiously "believed the entire concept of euthenics was vague and counter-productive to women's progress."&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |title= The Vassar Summer Institute |author= Vassar Historian |date=  |website= vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher=  |accessdate= 26 August 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011536/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |archivedate= 4 March 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having overcome a lukewarm reception, Vassar College officially opened its Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics in 1929.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth Wheeler (Physiology and Nutrition – VC '99) took over as director of euthenics studies in 1924. Wheeler remained director until [[Mary Shattuck Fisher Langmuir]] (VC '20) succeeded her in 1944, until 1951.&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute" /&gt;

The college continued for the 1934–35 academic year its successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls.  Intended to help students meet their college costs by working in their residences. For example, in Main, students earned $40 a year by doing relatively light work such as cleaning their rooms.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle1934"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1934/1934-03-10-coops.html |title= The college announced the trustees' decision to continue for the 1934-35 academic year this year's successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, through the [[Rubicon Foundation]], to Vassar to help fund operating deficits in the current and succeeding years and to improve faculty salaries.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicleMay1951"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1951/1951-05-23-blodgett-gift.html |title= President Blanding announced a $400,000 gift to the college from the chair of the board of trustees, Katharine Blodgett Hadley '20, through the Rubicon Foundation. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elmira College===
[[Elmira College]] is noted as the oldest college still in existence which (as a [[Timeline of women's colleges in the United States#First and oldest|college for women]]) granted degrees to women which were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the now-defunct [[Mary Sharp College]]).&lt;ref name="WomensCollegesUS"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969.

A special article was written in the December 12, 1937 ''[[New York Times]]'', quoting recent graduates of Elmira College, urging for courses in colleges for men on the care of children. Reporting that "preparation for the greatest of all professions, that of motherhood and child-training, is being given the students at Elmira College in the Nursery School which is Conducted as part of the Department of Euthenics."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

Elmira College was one of the first of the liberal arts colleges to recognize the fact that women should have some special training, integrated with the so-called liberal studies, which would prepare them to carry on, with less effort and fewer mistakes, a successful family life. Courses in nutrition, household economics, clothing selection, principles of foods and meal planning, child psychology, and education in family relations are a part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst"&gt;{{cite web

The Elmira College nursery school for fifteen children between the ages of two and five years was opened primarily as a laboratory for college students, but it had become so popular with parents in the community that there was always a long waiting list.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

The ''New York Times'' article notes how the nursery had become one of the essential laboratories of the college, where recent mothers testified to the value of the training they received while in college. "Today," one graduate said, "when it is often necessary for young women to continue professional work outside the home after marriage, it is important that young fathers, who must share in the actual care and training of the children, should have some knowledge of correct methods."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

===Today===
Many factors led to the movement never getting the funding it needed to remain relevant, including: vigorous debate about the exact meaning of euthenics, a strong [[antifeminism]] movement paralleling even stronger [[women's rights]] movements, confusion with the term eugenics, the economic impact of the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars. These factors also prevented the discipline from gaining the attention it needed to put together a lasting, vastly [[interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] curriculum. Therefore, it split off into separate disciplines. Child Study is one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that "Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the end of euthenics as originally defined by Ellen Swallow Richards ensued.

==Relationship with eugenics==
According to Ellen Richards, in her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910):&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;
{{quote|The betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings, is what the author means by Euthenics.

"Human vitality depends upon two primary conditions—[[heredity]] and [[hygiene]]—or conditions preceding birth and conditions during life."

[[Eugenics]] deals with race improvement through heredity.

Euthenics deals with race improvement through environment.

Eugenics is hygiene for the future generations.

Euthenics is hygiene for the present generation.

Eugenics must await careful investigation.

Euthenics has immediate opportunity.

Euthenics precedes eugenics, developing better men now, and thus inevitably creating a better race of men in the future. Euthenics is the term proposed for the preliminary science on which Eugenics must be based.}}

==Debate, misconceptions and opposition==
[[File:ЛестерФВорд.jpeg|200px|left|thumb|[[Lester Frank Ward]]]][[Image:aflexner21.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Abraham Flexner]], c. 1895.]]
[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Margaret Sanger]], 1922]]
[[File:Charles Benedict Davenport.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Charles Benedict Davenport]], ca. 1929]]
Debate over misconceptions about the movement started almost from the beginning. In his comparison "Eugenics, Euthenics, And Eudemics", ([[American Journal of Sociology]], Vol. 18, No. 6, May 1913), [[Lester Frank Ward|Lester F. Ward]] of [[Brown University]] opens the second section regarding euthenics lamenting: 
{{quote|Is there, then, nothing to do? Are we to accept that modem scientific fatalism known as [[laissez faire]], which enjoins the folding of the arms? Are we to preach a gospel of inaction? I for one certainly am not content to do so, and I believe that nothing I have thus far said [about eugenics] is inconsistent with the most vigorous action, and that in the direction of the betterment of the human race. The end and aim of the eugenists cannot be reproached. The race is far from perfect. Its condition is deplorable. Its improvement is entirely feasible, and in the highest degree desirable. Nor do I refer merely to economic conditions, to the poverty and misery of the disinherited classes. The intellectual state of the world is deplorable, and its improvement is clearly within the reach of society itself. It is therefore a question of method rather than of principle that concerns us.}}

Ward later noted about the organic environment that:
{{quote|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] has taught us that the chief barrier to the advance of any species of plants or animals is its competition with other plants and animals that contest the same ground. And therefore the fiercest opponents of any species are the members of the same species which demand the same elements of subsistence. Hence the chief form of relief in the organic world consists in the thinning-out of competitors. Any species of animals or plants left free to propagate at its normal rate would overrun the earth in a short time and leave no room for any other species. Any species that is sufficiently vigorous to resist its organic environment will crowd out all others and monopolize the earth. If nature permitted this there could be no variety, but only one monotonous aspect devoid of interest or beauty. Whatever we may think of the harsh method by which this is prevented, we cannot regret that it is prevented, and that we have a world of variety, interest, and aesthetic attractiveness.}}

Vassar historians note that "critics faulted the new program as a weakening of science and a slide into vocationalism.  The influential educator and historian of education, [[Abraham Flexner]]—one of the founders of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study—attacked the program, along with other “ad hoc” innovations like intercollegiate athletics and student governments, in Universities, American, English, German (1930)."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle" /&gt;{{cquote|
"Well, what is euthenics?  Euthenics is the 'science of efficient living;' and the 'science' is artificially pieced together of bits of mental hygiene, child guidance, nutrition, speech development and correction, family problems, wealth consumption, food preparation, household technology, and horticulture....  The institute is actually justified in an official publication by the profound question of a girl student who is reported as asking, 'What is the connection of Shakespeare with having a baby?'  The Vassar Institute of Euthenics bridges this gap!"}}

In the summer of 1926, [[Margaret Sanger]] created a stir when she gave a radio address, called "Racial Betterment", in the first Euthenics Institute, where she praised attempts to "close our gates to the so-called 'undesirables'" and proposed efforts to "discourage or cut down on the rapid multiplication of the unfit and undesirable at home", by government-subsidized voluntary sterilization.  (from ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger'', vol. 1 (2003), Esther Katz, ed.)

Eugenicist, [[Charles Benedict Davenport]], noted in his article "Euthenics and Eugenics," found reprinted in the ''Popular Science Monthly'' of January 1911, page 18, 20:&lt;ref name="CharlesBenedictDavenport"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davenport | first = Charles Benedict | authorlink = Charles Benedict Davenport | title = Euthenics and Eugenics | journal = [[Popular Science Monthly]] | volume = 78 | location = New York |date=January 1911 | pages =16–20 | url = https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo78newyuoft#page/2/mode/2up | accessdate=September 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus the two schools of euthenics and eugenics stand opposed, each viewing the other unkindly.  Against eugenics it is urged that it is a fatalistic doctrine and deprives life of the stimulus toward effort.  Against euthenics the other side urges that it demands an endless amount of money to patch up conditions in the vain effort to get greater efficiency.  Which of the two doctrines is true?

The thoughtful mind must concede that, as is so often the case where doctrines are opposed, each view is partial, incomplete and really false.  The truth does not exactly lie between the doctrines; it comprehends them both. What a child becomes is always the resultant of two sets of forces acting from the moment the fertilized egg begins its development—one is the set of internal tendencies and the other is the set of external influences.  What the result of an external influence—a particular environmental condition—shall be depends only in part upon the nature of the influence; it depends also upon the internal nature of the reacting [[protoplasm]].

Incest, cousin marriage, the marriage of defectives and tuberculous persons, are, in wide circles, taboo.  This fact affords the basis for the hope that, when the method of securing strong offspring, even from partially defective stock—and where is the strain without any defect?—is widely known, the teachings of science in respect even to marriage matings will be widely regarded and that in the generations to come the teachings and practice of euthenics will yield greater result because of the previous practice of the principles of eugenics.}}

{{cquote|From intensive study we realize the importance of eugenics—the right of birth, and also the subject of euthenics—the right to environment. Too little credit is given to environment when we speak of children having hereditary traits as "Like father, like son," or "Chip off the old block." Such phrases have their origin from the study of eugenics.  No one has ever taken an [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Edwards]] baby and reared it in a [[Jukes family|Jukes]] environment.}}

A '''functional beverage''' is a drink typically intended to convey a health benefit. Some include ingredients like herbs, vitamins, minerals, nootropics, [[amino acid]]s, or additional raw fruit or vegetables.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Examples of functional beverages include [[sports drinks|sports]] and performance drinks, [[energy drink]]s, ready to drink (RTD) teas, smart drinks (shine+), enhanced fruit drinks, [[soy beverage]]s, and [[enhanced water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flex-news-food.com/pages/16777/Beverages/Ingredients/USA/us-functional-beverages-market-young-market-growing-popularity.html U.S. Functional Beverages Market: A Young Market with Growing Popularity]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==
Functional beverages have become popular among people who want specific health benefits from their foods and beverages. Both convenience and health have been identified as important factors in consumers' decision-making about food and beverage purchases. Functional drinks are advertised as having various health benefits. For example, some claim to improve heart health, [[immune system|immunity]], [[digestion]], and [[joint]] health, while others promote themselves as [[satiety|satiating]] and energy-boosting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association: Functional Beverages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The functional beverage industry is a subsector of the [[functional food]] and non-alcoholic beverage industry. It is the fastest-growing sector of the industry, partially due to the maturity of the carbonated [[soft drink]] sector and heavy investments by major food and beverage companies.&lt;ref name="scholan"&gt;Scholan, I. "Functional Beverages-- where next? Innovation in functional beverages market is set to continue." ''International Food Ingredients'' December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the industry's growth may be the consumer-oriented market scheme whereby innovative ideas come from consumers. By 2008, in the U.S., the market share of functional beverages accounted for 48.9% of the non-alcoholic industry, which is worth $118.3 billion.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, W. "Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods'' August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, functional beverage consumption [[per capita]]{{where|date=October 2015}} rose to 66.4 gallons, while the carbonated soft drink sector saw a decline{{when|date=October 2015}} in per-capita consumption to 50.4 gallons (decreased from an average per-capita consumption of 192.5 gallons in 2006).&lt;ref name="Functional Beverages" /&gt;

Functional beverage industry players are generally categorized into four types:&lt;ref name="packaged2009"&gt;"Functional Foods and Beverages in US. MaryLand." ''Packaged Facts.'' May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Traditional non-alcoholic beverage companies, like [[PepsiCo]], [[Fuze Beverage]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. 
# Major food companies, such as [[Nestlé]], [[Altria]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[General Mills]], and the [[Campbell Soup Company]].
# Smaller-scaled private companies, like SALOMED GmbH&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salomed.com/functional-beverages&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Austria]], and specialized companies like Traditional Medicinals and [[POM Wonderful]].

The functional beverage industry encompasses a wide range of varieties targeting different health-related concerns.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; One trend has been toward hybrid drinks, which are marketed as having benefits like thirst-quenching ability, with daily dosages of vitamins or other nutrients.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; Another trend is the rise of [[probiotics]], exemplified by [[Activia]] yogurt, marketed for intestinal and immune health. Other beverages, like [[Function Drinks#Function: BRAINIAC|Function: BRAINIAC]], a [[carambola]] punch energy drink in the [[Function Drinks]] line, advertise improved memory and mental sharpness. Functional drinks marketed to children have also been developed, and received attention with Nestlé's [[Boost (beverage)|Boost]].

A 2005 trend toward single-serve functional beverages was fueled by consumers' demands for convenience.{{vague|date=October 2015}} According to Campbell's director of single-serve beverages, "People know they will be seen when they are drinking single-serving beverages, so the package is critical." &lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Bob "Sweet Revenge." ''Progressive Grocer'' 2005 84(5): 34-36, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Drinks marketed toward weight loss, health, and beauty (like Nova the Essential Drink) account for a considerable [[market share]]. Lastly, "energy-boosting" functional beverage products, such as [[Red Bull]] and [[5-Hour Energy]], have been rated fastest{{when|date=January 2015}} in growth in the functional beverage market.

== Market ==

The functional beverage industry generally competes using four primary strategies:&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt;
# Promote their own products as healthy and unique, by clearly distinguishing their health claims from similar products, and by specifying naturally healthy ingredients.
# Consider extensions of existing brand lines. For example, Nestle extended their Boost product line by adding Kids Essentials to the line, thereby extending the adult-focused Boost line to a new market (children).
# Larger companies compete for market share by [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquiring]] smaller companies that may own a particular market sector.&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt; For example, Coca-Cola purchased Glaceau from [[Energy Brands]], and [[Odwalla]] and [[Fuze Beverage]] from their respective founders, in order to increase Coca-Cola's market share.
# Explore new functional brands by identifying new markets and demands.

Market segments of the functional beverage industry are divided mainly into four parts.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; Those include hydration; energy/rejuvenation; health and wellness; and weight management.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; Each segment has its own [[target market]] and consumers. Overlapping of target consumers does occur—not because of undefined market needs, but due to consumer acceptance of functional beverages.&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt;

=== Hydration ===
Recently,{{when|date=October 2015}} there has been an increase in the promotion of [[hydrational fluid|hydration]] drinks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Fowhich it marketed as an exclusive hydration drink, sold only in [[Neiman Marcus]] stores. Among the drink's ingredient list were [[antioxidant]] vitamins and fruit extracts, which the company claims "hydrate the inner and outer layer of the skin" and protect drinkers from [[free radical]]s.&lt;ref name="Benefiting Beverages"&gt;Benefiting Beverages. ''Prepared Foods'' 2009 178(8): 13-24, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gatorade]] has also created several drinks marketed as hydration beverages with various health benefits. Its "Thirst Quencher" drinks, according to advertisements, each contain an "excellent source" of various vitamins:&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;
* 25% of the [[Reference Daily Intake|RDI]] of B vitamins (including vitamins [[vitamin B3|B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[vitamin B5|B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]);
* 20% of the RDI of the [[antioxidant]] [[vitamin E]]; and,
* 20% of the RDI of [[vitamin C]].

In tandem with these adjustments, a low-calorie version called G2 was also reformulated. According to Gatorade, G2 now also provides:&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;
* an "excellent source" (25% of the RDI) of B vitamins (including vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;); and,
* a "good source" (10% of the RDI) of vitamins [[Vitamin C|C]] and [[vitamin E|E]].

Gatorade's new products are a good example of the first major strategy of competition, listed in the "Market" section above. By reformulating its products, Gatorade's goals were to promote their own new products as healthier, and to emphasize the healthy ingredients in the drinks.

=== Energy and stimulation ===
Highly caffeinated, often highly sweetened "energy drinks" have become popular on the beverage market in the United States, as well as globally, in the past decade. Consumer demand has helped generate a new generation of "energy drink" brands containing similar amounts of caffeine, calories, and sugar.&lt;ref name="bogue 2006" /&gt;

Various stimulants found in energy drinks include [[taurine]], [[glucoronolactone]], [[caffeine]], [[B vitamins]], [[guarana]], [[ginseng]], [[ginkgo biloba]], [[L-carnitine]], [[sugars]], antioxidants, [[yerba maté]], [[creatine]], and [[milk thistle]].&lt;ref name="sharon"&gt;Sharon Palmer. "Functional Beverages" http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm. Accessed Dec 3 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these ingredients have been approved by the [[FDA]], health experts still recommend that consumers read their energy drinks' labels, as these ingredients may not improve health.&lt;ref name="sharon" /&gt;

=== Health and wellness ===
"Health-conscious" individuals are among the target consumers of many functional beverage companies. To target these individuals, many companies have introduced functional beverages which contain less sugar, and therefore less calories.{{synthesis inline|date=October 2015}} For example, [[VitaminWater]] 10 contains only 10 calories per serving (25 calories for a 351mL bottle, with 7.5&amp;nbsp;grams of sugar). An entire bottle also contains 250% of the RDI of vitamin C,&lt;ref name="rebecca"&gt;Rebecca Wright. "Functional Beverages: Surviving or Thriving?" http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/articles/2009/07/functional-beverages-thriving-or-surviving. Retrieved December 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and 25% of the RDI of vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt; VitaminWater 10 lowered its calorie content by using an all-natural sweetener ([[stevia]]) extracted from the ''[[Stevia rebaudiana]]'' plant. This also makes it possible for the company to advertise VitaminWater 10 as "natural".&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;

=== Weight management ===
With increased worries about [[obesity]] and its implications on health, combined with consumer demand for convenience goods, consumer demand has increased for easy weight loss methods that can be easily integrated into daily lifestyles.&lt;ref name="william" /&gt; Functional beverages are striving to market themselves as such, by adding ingredients that are claimed to promote weight loss.&lt;ref name="william"&gt;"Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods.'' 1 August 2009. Assessed 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* Nestlé and The Coca-Cola Company have partnered to produce [[Enviga]], which they describe as a "calorie-burning beverage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/healthy-weight-commitment Coca-Cola – Press Center – New Products – Enviga Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Skinny Water (owned by Skinny Nutritional Corp.) and [[Nutrisoda]]'s Slenderized (owned by PepsiCo) have both used a [[polyphenol]] called [[epigallocatechin gallate]] (EGCG) in their products for their "{{Sic|metabolize boosting}} effect". 
* A tea extract called "Blue California", which has a 95% EGCG content, is now on the market.&lt;ref&gt;Landi, Heather "Tea Revolution." ''Beverage World'' 2009 128(10): 78, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 1 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investigators report slimming actions induced by [[chlorogenic acid]]s from [[green coffee]], but further investigations need to be performed.&lt;!-- Need to list the risks here --&gt;

===Sales===
As of 2008, based on dollar sales, the most popular functional beverages, in order, were:&lt;ref name="Functional Beverages"&gt;Functional Beverages. ''Beverage World'' 2008 127(3): 14, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# Health and wellness drinks, with 62.2% of dollar sales
# Hydration drinks (28%)
# Energy/Rejuvenation drinks (8.4%)
# Weight Management drinks (1.2%)

== Consumer demographic ==
According to a 2006 article, the functional beverage market's [[consumer group]] is characterized as well-educated females aged 35–55, belonging to the upper middle, middle, and lower middle classes.&lt;ref name="bogue 2006" /&gt; This is thought to result from this group's perceptions that functional drinks produce positive health beliefs, as well as their relatively high [[disposable income]].&lt;ref name="bogue 2006"&gt;Bogue, J., Seymour, C. and Sorenson, D. "Market-oriented new product development of meal replacement and meal complement beverages." ''Journal of Food Products Marketing’’, 2006 12(3): 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 article stated that within the energy and stimulant drink sector, young adults aged 18 to 34 are considered to be the main target market, as evidenced by high consumption rates.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, C. and Emerton, V. "Food and Drinks through the Lifecycle." ''Surrey:Leatherhead International’’. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to constant changes in attitudes about different types of functional beverages, these target markets could change.&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;Van Trijp, H.C.M. and Van Der Lans, I.A. (2007). "Consumer perceptions of nutrition and health claims." ''Appetite’’. 2007 48(3):305–324&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health concerns ==
Health experts are concerned about the increased consumption and popularity of functional beverages. Although these beverages may serve to hydrate the individual, they may not mitigate or even address today's major health issues, such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], and [[cancer]]. Most functional beverages are sweetened, and consumption of sweetened beverages is associated with higher levels of obesity and heart disease.&lt;ref name="ADA, Functionaldrinks"&gt;http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association – Functional Beverages Accessed 2 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these drinks contain significant amounts of [[sugars]] and hence calories, which would add to discretionary and total [[caloric]] intake. As such, these ingredients pose health risks because of what they contain (sugar and caffeine) or what they replace in the diet (vitamin and mineral-rich foods).

Another set of concerns is that some functional beverages contain ingredients that have not been sufficiently studied for health benefits, safety, and dosage. At the same time, many functional beverages have higher levels of a certain ingredient, like caffeine—which, when consumed in large amounts, is associated with heart disease and cancer.&lt;!-- need citation --&gt; &lt;ref name="ADA, Functionaldrinks" /&gt;

=== Sugar content ===
Many functional drinks have high levels of sugar, even if they have other "healthy" ingredients. For example, a 20oz bottle of [[Glacéau]]'s [[VitaminWater]] has been reported to contain approximately 33 g of sugar, which is similar to the sugar content of a can of [[Coca-Cola]]. This prompted [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to be sued for claiming that VitaminWater was a healthy beverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/new/200901151.html  [[Coca-Cola]] was sued for Fraudulent Claims on Obesity-Promoting "Vitaminwater" Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their sugar content, many functional beverages may not be as healthy an alternative as other commonly consumed beverages. In addition, the sugar content of such beverages promotes dental cavities amongst frequent users.

=== Energy drinks ===
{{Main article|Energy drink}}
In some functional beverages, particularly energy drinks, the caffeine content can be up to 141 milligrams per serving, more than an average 8-ounce cup of coffee containing 133&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine. There have been reports to Health Canada of adverse reactions involving energy drinks.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/prod/energy-energie-eng.php#he It's Your Health – Safe Use of Energy Drinks.

{{distinguish|Functional medicine}}
A '''functional disorder''' is a [[medical condition]] that impairs normal functioning of bodily processes that remains largely undetected under examination, dissection or even under a microscope. At the exterior, there is no appearance of abnormality.  This stands in contrast to a '''structural disorder''' (in which some part of the body can be seen to be abnormal) or a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic disorder]] (in which symptoms are caused by psychological or psychiatric illness). Definitions vary somewhat between fields of medicine.

Generally, the mechanism that causes a functional disorder is unknown, poorly understood, or occasionally unimportant for treatment purposes. The brain or nerves are often believed to be involved. It is common that a person with one functional disorder will have others.

==Status==
Whether a given medical condition is termed a ''functional disorder'' depends in part on the state of knowledge.  Some diseases, including [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[migraine]] headaches were once considered functional disorders, but are no longer generally classified that way.&lt;ref name="isbn0-300-07401-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Natelson, Benjamin H. |title=Facing and fighting fatigue: a practical approach |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1998 |pages=33 |isbn=0-300-07401-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a '''group purchasing organization''' ('''GPO''') is an entity that is created to leverage the [[purchasing power]] of a group of businesses to obtain discounts from [[Distributor (business)|vendors]] based on the collective buying power of the GPO members.

Many GPOs are funded by administrative fees that are paid by the vendors that GPOs oversee.  Some GPOs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krebs|first1=John|title=Why Group Purchasing Organizations are good for manufacturers and members|url=http://www.fastcasual.com/articles/why-group-purchasing-organizations-are-good-for-manufacturers-and-members/|work=FastCasual.com|publisher=Networld Media Group|date=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are funded by fees paid by the buying members.  Some GPOs are funded by a combination of both of these methods.  These fees can be set as a percentage of the purchase or set as an annual flat rate. Some GPOs set mandatory participation levels for their members, while others are completely voluntary.  Members participate based on their purchasing needs and their level of confidence in what should be competitive pricing negotiated by their GPOs.

Group purchasing is used in many [[industries]] to purchase [[raw material]]s and supplies, but it is common practice in the [[grocery]] industry, [[health care]], [[electronics]], industrial [[manufacturing]] and [[agriculture|agricultural industries]]. As the [[Electric power industry|electrical]] industry has started deregulating, it has also become an increasing trend there. Also, in recent years, group purchasing has begun to take root in the nonprofit community. Group purchasing amongst nonprofits is still relatively new, but is quickly becoming common place as nonprofits aim to find ways to reduce overhead expenses. In the healthcare field, GPOs have most commonly been accessed by acute-care organizations, but non-profit Community Clinics and Health Centers throughout the U.S. have also been engaging in group purchasing.

==History==
The first healthcare GPO was established in 1910 by the Hospital Bureau of New York. For many decades, healthcare GPOs grew slowly in number, to only 10 in 1962.

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] stimulated growth in the number of GPOs to 40 in 1974. That number tripled between 1974 and 1977. The institution of the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) in 1983 focused greater scrutiny on costs and fostered further rapid GPO expansion.  In 1986, Congress granted GPOs in healthcare "Safe Harbor" from federal anti-kickback statutes after successful lobbying efforts.
By 2007, there were hundreds of healthcare GPOs, "affiliates" and cooperatives in the United States that were availing themselves of substantial revenues obtained from vendors in the form of administrative fees, or "remuneration." 96 percent of all acute-care hospitals and 98 percent of all community hospitals held at least one GPO membership. Importantly, 97 percent of all not-for-profit, non-governmental hospitals participated in some form of group purchasing.

With healthcare costs rising sharply in the early 1980s, the federal government revised Medicare from a system of fee-for-service (FFS) payments to PPS, under which hospitals receive a fixed amount for each patient with a given [[diagnosis]]. Other insurers also limited what hospitals could charge. The result was a financial squeeze on hospitals, compelling them to seek new ways to manage their costs.

In specifically exempting GPOs from the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, many healthcare providers interpreted the act as an encouragement to the expansion of GPOs.
Congress did not specify any limit on contract administration fees, but required the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to monitor such fees for possible abuse – particularly with respect to fees in excess of 3.0 percent.

In 1991, HHS promulgated safe harbor regulations, reflecting Congress’ intent to permit contract administration fees and creating the additional safeguard that GPOs inform members of administrative fees in excess of 3.0 percent.  Despite these safeguards, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) published a study in 2002 indicating that GPOs did not always in fact reduce the cost of supplies and equipment for hospitals, but in some cases increased these costs by as much as 37%.  Further examining the practices of GPOs, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clarified that "safety zone thresholds do not prevent and should not be appropriately read as preventing antitrust challenges to any of the alleged anticompetitive contracting practices..." of GPOs.

In 2002, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee imposed stricter standards on GPOs in healthcare, requiring the adoption of a [http://www.chca.com/mm/pdf/higpa_code_of_conduct.pdf Code of Conduct] to which GPOs must subscribe.

Critics of GPOs charge that, as long as GPOs receive fees from the vendors they are charged with policing, the industry has anti-competitive contracting potential that should be subjected to further scrutiny and/or regulation.

===Vertical-market GPO===

A vertical GPO assists companies and organizations within a specific industry or market segment.

====Healthcare GPO====
A healthcare group purchasing organization (GPO) assists in promoting quality healthcare relief and assists diverse providers in effectively managing expenses. A GPO aggregates the purchasing volume of its members for various goods and services and develops contracts with suppliers through which members may buy at group price and terms if they choose to. GPOs typically provide contracted discounts on medical supplies, nutrition, pharmacy and laboratory. Some of the large GPOs have expanded contract portfolios to also offer discounts on office supplies and non-medical related services.
   
A GPO's earnings come from an "Administrative" fee. GPOs may collect an "Administrative" fee up to 3.0% of all sales volumes from the vendors that they negotiate a contract from, upon selling products to their member hospitals. These fees do not influence the prices negotiated. They are used to cover the GPO's operating expenses.  If there is a remainder it is distributed back to the GPO owners; thus, GPO owners achieve cost-savings on the goods they choose to buy through group contracts, and also receive distributions back from the GPO. General GPO members may also receive some fee share as part of their member agreement, though this practice is no longer typical; thus the primary benefit to a GPO member is the access to deeply discounted pricing.

GPOs submit that their services allow for improved operating margins for healthcare providers, and that members enjoy value added benefits like clinical support, [[benchmarking]] data, [[supply chain]] support and comprehensive portfolios of products and services to address specific needs.

GPOs vary in their strategy for negotiating discounts with suppliers - from requiring that its members not join other GPOs (exclusivity) to requiring compliance to awarding single source contracts. As the healthcare industry becomes saturated with GPOs, pricing is one way for GPOs to bring in new members or convince members of another GPO to switch.

====Foodservice or grocery GPO====
A [[foodservice]] or [[grocery]] GPO focuses exclusively on the $600 billion foodservice marketplace, including food and food-related purchasing for multi-unit foodservice operators, contract negotiation and [[supply chain]] services. 
These negotiations are made with supplier/manufacturing agreements and purchasing contracts. Categories for grocer purchases include: [[poultry]], fresh [[produce]], frozen food products, fresh and frozen meats, [[candy]] and [[snacks]], [[dairy]] and [[bakery]], [[dry goods]], disposables and [[beverages]].

====Industrial manufacturing GPO====
A manufacturer’s GPO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgan|first1=Jamie|title=Prime Advantage Corp.|url=http://manufacturing-today.com/index.php/featured-content/382-prime-advantage-corp|work=Manufacturing Today|publisher=ITP Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeds in solving [[procurement]] and [[Strategic sourcing|sourcing]] concerns by aggregating the demand for products and services used in the manufacturing and [[Production line|production]] process and delivering deep savings on [[raw materials]], services and components by issuing [[Rebate (marketing)|rebates]], [[discounts]], and preferred pricing to its members. 
The combined buying power helps manufacturers save money on their purchases and more effectively compete against the largest global manufacturers.

==== Electrical GPO ====
A GPO in the [[Electric power industry|electrical]] industry attempts to help energy consumers and businesses solve issues with the rising cost of electricity by pooling the electrical demand of multiple consumers, grouping them together, and through this, delivering savings to its members by obtaining more favorable [[Cost of electricity|electrical rates]]. The difference between residential and commercial rates can be quite large in many regions, and are at least 7% cheaper in every US state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.en-powered.com/blog/the-opportunity-of-energy-group-buying|title=The Opportunity of Energy Group-Buying|website=EnPowered|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buying power of the resulting groups allows companies and individuals alike to save greatly on their electrical bills.

====Non-profit GPO====

Non-profit GPOs are similar to regular GPOs, but they are typically made of up a board of non-profit, community-based organizations working together to help lower their costs.

===Horizontal-market GPO===
Whereas a vertical GPO assists organizations in specific industries, such as health care, food service, legal, dairy, and industrial manufacturing, a horizontal GPO assists companies across a broad spectrum of industries.

====Non-strategic, or indirect spend horizontal market GPO====

A horizontal indirect spend GPO succeeds in reducing procurement costs by aggregating the demand for non-strategic, or indirect cost supplies and services used by a broad horizontal market spectrum of member client organizations by consolidating purchasing power and establishing contracts to achieve preferred pricing, terms, and service standards.

The resulting combined buying power helps the usually mid-size and larger member client organizations save money on their purchases of categories such as temporary labor services, office products, safety supplies, office equipment, packaging supplies, uniform &amp; laundry services, pest control, and expedited parcel delivery.  The consolidation of purchasing effort with the GPO also allows member clients savings from reduced staffing overhead costs. According to an analysis by SpendMatters, from an adoption perspective, 15-20% of the Fortune 1000 currently use buying consortiums and 85% of the time, they’re seeing 10%+ of savings in the categories in which they put through a consortium model.&lt;ref&gt;http://spendmatters.com/2011/09/13/new-research-group-purchasing-organizations-gpos-and-consortia-what-you-need-to-know/&lt;/ref&gt;

The suppliers to this type of GPO offer preferred pricing, terms, and service standards because they experience lower overall selling expenses and the increased volume usually associated with the addition of a single very large customer.

== History ==
The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the [[Biomedical model|biomedical]] perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by [[disease]]. An example of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with [[Human body|physical]], [[biological]], [[Psychology|psychological]], and [[social stress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stokes|first=J.|last2=Noren|first2=J.|last3=Shindell|first3=S.|date=1982-01-01|title=Definition of terms and concepts applicable to clinical preventive medicine|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=8|issue=1|pages=33–41|issn=0094-5145|pmid=6764783|doi=10.1007/bf01324395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to [[well-being]], in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/37089|title=The first ten years of the World Health Organization|last=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|year=1958|isbn=|location=Geneva|publication-date=1958|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phprimer.afmc.ca/Part1-TheoryThinkingAboutHealth/ConceptsOfHealthAndIllness/DefinitionsofHealth|title=Part 1 – Theory: Thinking About Health Chapter 1 Concepts of Health and Illness|website=phprimer.afmc.ca|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health. Again, the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the development of the health promotion movement in the 1980s. This brought in a new conception of health, not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as "a resource for living". 1984 WHO revised the definition of health defined it as "the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/107835|title=Health promotion : a discussion document on the concept and principles : summary report of the Working Group on Concept and Principles of Health Promotion, Copenhagen, 9–13 July 1984|last=World Health Organization. Regional Office for Europe|first=|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe|year=1984|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=|type=ICP/HSR 602(m01)5 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, health referred to the ability to maintain homeostasis and recover from insults. Mental, intellectual, emotional and social health referred to a person's ability to handle stress, to acquire skills, to maintain relationships, all of which form resources for resiliency and independent living.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This opens up many possibilities for health to be taught, strengthened and learned. 

Since the late 1970s, the federal Healthy People Initiative has been a visible component of the United States’ approach to improving population health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/tools-and-resources/Federal-Prevention-Initiatives Federal Prevention Initiatives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615184241/https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/tools-and-resources/Federal-Prevention-Initiatives |date=2016-06-15 }}.

Progress has been limited to many objectives, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of Healthy People in shaping outcomes in the context of a decentralized and uncoordinated US health system. Healthy People 2020 gives more prominence to health promotion and preventive approaches and adds a substantive focus on the importance of addressing social determinants of health.

Systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by [[health care provider]]s. Applications with regard to animal health are covered by the [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary sciences]]. The term "healthy" is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans, such as in the sense of [[healthy community design|healthy communities]], [[healthy city|healthy cities]] or [[healthy environment]]s. In addition to [[health care]] interventions and a person's surroundings, a number of other factors are known to influence the health status of individuals, including their background, lifestyle, and economic, social conditions and spirituality; these are referred to as "determinants of health." Studies have shown that high levels of stress can affect human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24756311 |title=BBC News – How stressed are you? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decade of the 21st century, the conceptualization of health as an ability opened the door for self-assessments to become the main indicators to judge the performance of efforts aimed at improving human health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jadad|first=Alejandro R.|date=2016-11-01|title=Creating a pandemic of health: What is the role of digital technologies?|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=260–268|doi=10.1057/s41271-016-0016-1|pmid=27899800|issn=0197-5897}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It also created the opportunity for every person to feel healthy, even in the presence of multiple chronic diseases, or a terminal condition, and for the re-examination of determinants of health, away from the traditional approach that focuses on the reduction of the prevalence of diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harvardpublichealthreview.org/creating-a-pandemic-of-health-opportunities-and-lessons-for-a-university-initiative-at-the-intersection-of-health-equity-and-innovation/|title=Creating a Pandemic of Health: Opportunities and Lessons for a University Initiative at the Intersection of Health, Equity, and Innovation {{!}} Harvard Public Health Review: A Student Publication|website=harvardpublichealthreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Determinants==

Generally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of  their life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037| pmid=29301638|title = Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility| journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine| volume=200| pages=258–261|year = 2018|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of [[health science]], but also through the efforts and intelligent [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] choices of the individual and society. According to the [[World Health Organization]], the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"&gt;World Health Organization.

An increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, [[health care system|health care organization]] and [[health policy]], one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreyeva|first=Tatiana|last2=Chaloupka|first2=Frank J.|last3=Brownell|first3=Kelly D.|title=Estimating the potential of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages to reduce consumption and generate revenue|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=52|issue=6|pages=413–416|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.03.013|pmid=21443899|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;– such as the 1974 [[Lalonde report]] from Canada;&lt;ref name="Lalonde"/&gt; the [[Alameda County Study]] in California;&lt;ref name="Housman &amp; Dorman 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Housman|first1=Jeff|last2=Dorman|first2=Steve|title=The Alameda County Study: A Systematic, Chronological Review|journal=American Journal of Health Education|date=September–October 2005|volume=36|issue=5|pages=302–308|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ792845|accessdate=27 December 2011|format=PDF|issn=1055-6699|id=ERIC document number EJ792845|ref=CITEREFHousmanDorman2005|doi=10.1080/19325037.2005.10608200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series of [[World Health Report]]s of the World Health Organization, which focuses on [[global health]] issues including access to health care and improving [[public health]] outcomes, especially in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

The concept of the "''health field,''" as distinct from [[medicine|medical care]], emerged from the Lalonde report from Canada. The report identified three interdependent fields as key determinants of an individual's health. These are:&lt;ref name="Lalonde"/&gt;
* Lifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e., over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death;
* Environmental: all matters related to health external to the [[human body]] and over which the individual has little or no control;
* Biomedical: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up.

The maintenance and promotion of health is achieved through different combination of physical, [[mental health|mental]], and social well-being, together sometimes referred to as the ''"health triangle."''&lt;ref&gt;Georgia State University. 1998. [http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwche/ ''Health Triangle Slides''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nutter S. (2003) ''The Health Triangle''. Anchor Points, Inc., {{ISBN|0974876003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's 1986 ''[[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]]'' further stated that health is not just a state, but also "a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/previous/ottawa/en/index.html The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion.] Adopted at the First International Conference on Health Promotion, Ottawa, 21 November 1986 – WHO/HPR/HEP/95.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via [[exercise]], enough [[sleep]], maintaining a healthy [[body weight]], limiting [[alcohol]] use, and avoiding [[smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Housman|Dorman|2005|pp=303–304}}.

The environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the [[natural environment]], the [[built environment]] and the [[social environment]]. Factors such as clean [[water]] and [[air]], adequate [[house|housing]], and safe communities and [[road traffic safety|roads]] all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children.&lt;ref name="The determinants of health"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. [http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/facts_figures/basic_needs.shtml ''The UN World Water Development Report: Facts and Figures – Meeting basic needs.''] Accessed 12 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of [[obesity]], linked to lower overall health and well being.&lt;ref name="Fanny Price"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Björk J, Albin M, Grahn P, Jacobsson H, Ardö J, Wadbro J, Ostergren PO | title = Recreational Values of the Natural Environment in Relation to Neighborhood Satisfaction, Physical Activity, Obesity and Well being | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = e2 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18365329 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2007.062414 | url = http://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/5178417/1056501.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in [[public policy]] and land use.

[[Genetics]], or inherited traits from parents, also play a role in determining the health status of individuals and populations. This can encompass both the [[genetic predisposition|predisposition]] to certain diseases and health conditions, as well as the habits and behaviors individuals develop through the lifestyle of their [[families]]. For example, genetics may play a role in the manner in which people cope with [[Stress (biology)|stress]], either mental, emotional or physical. For example, [[obesity]] is a significant problem in the United States that contributes to bad mental health and causes stress in the lives of great numbers of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Human Factors, Business Management, Training and Education {{!}} SpringerLink|volume = 498|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-42070-7|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2017|isbn = 978-3-319-42069-1|last1 = Kantola|first1 = Jussi Ilari|last2 = Barath|first2 = Tibor|last3 = Nazir|first3 = Salman|last4 = Andre|first4 = Terence}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Potential issues===
{{Citation style|section|date=March 2014}}

A number of types of health issues are common around the globe.  [[Disease]] is one of the most common. According to GlobalIssues.org, approximately 36&amp;nbsp;million people die each year from non-communicable (not contagious) disease including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease (Shah, 2014).

Among communicable diseases, both viral and bacterial, [[AIDS]]/[[HIV]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] are the most common, causing millions of deaths every year (Shah, 2014).

Another health issue that causes death or contributes to other health problems is malnutrition, especially among children.  One of the groups malnutrition affects most is young children.  Approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;million children under the age of 5 die from malnutrition, usually brought on by not having the money to find or make food (Shah, 2014).

Bodily injuries are also a common health issue worldwide.  These injuries, including broken bones, fractures, and burns can reduce a person's quality of life or can cause fatalities including infections that resulted from the injury or the severity injury in general (Moffett, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Anup (5 January 2014). [http://www.globalissues.org/issue/587/health-issues "Health Issues."] ''Global Issues''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle choices are contributing factors to poor health in many cases.  These include smoking cigarettes, and can also include a poor diet, whether it is overeating or an overly constrictive diet.  Inactivity can also contribute to health issues and also a lack of sleep, excessive alcohol consumption, and neglect of oral hygiene (Moffett2013).There are also genetic disorders that are inherited by the person and can vary in how much they affect the person and when they surface (Moffett, 2013).

Though the majority of these health issues are preventable, a major contributor to global ill health is the fact that approximately 1 billion people lack access to health care systems (Shah, 2014). Arguably, the most common and harmful health issue is that a great many people do not have access to quality remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/health/ |title=United Nations Global Issues |publisher=Un.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608150700/http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/health/ |archivedate=2016-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intrahealth.org/page/the-top-10-global-health-issues-to-watch-in-2013 |title=The Top 10 Global Health Issues to Watch in 2013 |publisher=Intrahealth.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
{{main article|Mental health}}
The [[World Health Organization]] describes mental health as "a state of [[well-being]] in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community".&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2005).

Mental illness is described as 'the spectrum of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral conditions that interfere with social and emotional well-being and the lives and productivity of people. Having a mental illness can seriously impair, temporarily or permanently, the mental functioning of a person. Other terms include: 'mental health problem', 'illness', 'disorder', 'dysfunction'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Steven W.

Roughly a quarter of all adults 18 and over in the US are considered diagnosable with mental illness. Mental illnesses are the leading cause of disability in the US and Canada. Examples include, [[schizophrenia]], [[ADHD]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and [[Autism spectrum|autism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america/index.shtml The numbers count: Mental disorders in America]. nih.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Many teens suffer from mental health issues in response to the pressures of society and social problems they encounter. Some of the key mental health issues seen in teens are: [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorders]], and [[drug abuse]]. There are many ways to prevent these health issues from occurring such as communicating well with a teen suffering from mental health issues. Mental health can be treated and be attentive to teens' behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/teen/pages/Mental-Health-and-Teens-Watch-for-Danger-Signs.aspx |title=Mental Health and Teens: Watch for Danger Signs |publisher=HealthyChildren.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&amp;nbsp;Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
* Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
* Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
* Family history of mental health [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/what-is-mental-health/index.html problems]

An important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide [[nutrients]] to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. [[blood pressure]]). The [[food guide pyramid]] is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of [[cancer]], and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livelifewell.nsw.gov.au/healthyeating/ |title=Healthy Eating: Why should I make healthy food choices? |publisher=Livelifewell.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227194359/http://www.livelifewell.nsw.gov.au/healthyeating/ |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] is commonly associated with health-promoting effects due to the fact that it contains some bioactive compounds like [[phenolic compound]]s, [[isoprenoid]]s and [[alkaloid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Garrido M |author2=González-Flores D |author3=Marchena AM |author4=Propr E |author5=García-Parra J |author6=Barriga C |author7=Rodríguez A.B. |title=A lycopene-enriched virgin olive oil enhances antioxidant status in humans |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=93 |issue=8 |pages=1820–6 |pmid=23225211 |year=2013 |doi=10.1002/jsfa.5972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise===
{{Main article | Exercise}}
[[Exercise|Physical exercise]] enhances or maintains [[physical fitness]] and overall health and wellness. It strengthens muscles and improves the [[cardiovascular system]]. According to the [[National Institutes of Health]], there are four types of exercise: [[endurance]], [[Physical strength|strength]], [[flexibility]], and [[Balance (ability)|balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 Types of Exercise|url=https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/4-types-exercise|publisher=Go4Life, National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|language=en|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleep===
{{Main article | Sleep | Sleep deprivation}}
Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing [[sleep deprivation]] has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pilkington |first=Stephanie |date=August 7, 2013 |title=Causes and consequences of sleep deprivation in hospitalized patients |journal=Nursing Standard |volume=27 |issue=49 |pages=35–42 |doi=10.7748/ns2013.08.27.49.35.e7649|pmid=23924135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/august/sleep-and-sickness.html |title=New Research Confirms Lack of Sleep Connected to Getting Sick |publisher=cmu.edu |author=Shilo Rea |date=2015-08-31|accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the role of sleep in regulating [[Sleep and metabolism|metabolism]], insufficient sleep may also play a role in [[weight gain]] or, conversely, in impeding [[weight loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Patel |first=Sanjay R. |last2=Hu |first2=Frank B. |date=January 17, 2008 |title=Short sleep duration and weight gain: a systematic review |journal=Obesity (Silver Spring) |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=643–653 |doi=10.1038/oby.2007.118 |pmid=18239586 |pmc=2723045}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the [[World Health Organization]], declared that "shiftwork that involves [[Circadian rhythm|circadian]] disruption is probably [[carcinogen]]ic to humans," speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2007/pr180.html |title=IARC Monographs Programme finds cancer hazards associated with shiftwork, painting and firefighting |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer |date=December 5, 2007 |access-date=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age and concluded that "Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hirshkowitz, Max |author2=Whiton, Kaitlyn | title=National Sleep Foundation's sleep time duration recommendations: methodology and results summary | journal= Sleep Health: Journal of the National Sleep Foundation |url= http://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(15)00015-7/fulltext |date=14 January 2015 | pmid = 29073412| doi= 10.1016/j.sleh.2014.12.010 |accessdate=25 November 2015  |display-authors=etal | volume=1 |issue=1 | pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of science===
{{Main article|Health science|Health care}}
[[File:Nieuws uit Indonesië, het werk van de Nederlandse dienst voor Volksgezondheid Weeknummer 46-21 - Open Beelden - 16742.ogv|thumb|upright=0.95|The Dutch Public Health Service provides medical care for the natives of the [[Dutch East Indies]], May 1946]]
[[Health science]] is the branch of science focused on health. There are two main approaches to health science: the study and [[research]] of the [[Human body|body]] and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure [[disease]]s and other physical and mental impairments. The science builds on many sub-fields, including [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[physics]], [[epidemiology]], [[pharmacology]], [[medical sociology]]. Applied health sciences endeavor to better understand and improve human health through applications in areas such as [[health education]], [[biomedical engineering]], [[biotechnology]] and [[public health]].

Organized interventions to improve health based on the principles and procedures developed through the health sciences are provided by practitioners trained in [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[nutrition]], [[pharmacy]], [[social work]], [[psychology]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]] and other [[health care provider|health care professions]]. Clinical practitioners focus mainly on the health of individuals, while public health practitioners consider the overall health of communities and populations. [[Workplace wellness]] programs are increasingly adopted by companies for their value in improving the health and well-being of their employees, as are [[school health services]] in order to improve the health and well-being of children.

===Role of public health===
{{Main article|Public health}}
{{See also|Global health}}

[[File:NewZealand-Stamp-1933-Health.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|Postage stamp, [[New Zealand]], 1933. Public health has been promoted&amp;nbsp;– and depicted&amp;nbsp;– in a wide variety of ways.]]
Public health has been described as "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Winslow CE | title = The Untilled Fields of Public Health | journal = Science | volume = 51 | issue = 1306 | pages = 23–33 | year = 1920 | pmid = 17838891 | doi = 10.1126/science.51.1306.23 | url = https://archive.org/details/cihm_90880 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a [[pandemic]]). Public health has many sub-fields, but typically includes the interdisciplinary categories of [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]]. [[Environmental Health|Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], and [[occupational health]] are also important areas of public health.

The focus of public health interventions is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behavior]], [[healthy community design|communities]], and (in aspects relevant to human health) [[environmental protection|environments]]. Its aim is to prevent health problems from happening or re-occurring by implementing [[health education|educational programs]], developing [[health policy|policies]], administering services and conducting [[research]].&lt;ref&gt;Association of Schools of Public Health. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307160406/http://www.whatispublichealth.org/about/index.html ''What is Public Health?''] Retrieved 2010-06-24&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an [[outbreak]]. [[Vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s to prevent the spread of [[communicable disease]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures, as are educational campaigns to promote vaccination and the use of condoms (including overcoming resistance to such).

[[Public health]] also takes various actions to limit the health disparities between different areas of the [[country]] and, in some cases, the [[continent]] or [[world]]. One issue is the access of individuals and communities to health care in terms of financial, geographical or socio-cultural constraints to accessing and using services.&lt;ref&gt;Hispanics and the Future of America. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19910 ''Access to and Quality of Health Care'']&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of the public [[health system]] include the areas of [[maternal health|maternal]] and child health, health services administration, emergency response, and prevention and control of [[infectious disease|infectious]] and [[chronic disease]]s.

The great positive impact of public health programs is widely acknowledged. Due in part to the policies and actions developed through public health, the 20th century registered a decrease in the mortality rates for [[infants]] and [[child]]ren and a continual increase in [[life expectancy]] in most parts of the world. For example, it is estimated that life expectancy has increased for Americans by thirty years since 1900,&lt;ref&gt;Association of Schools of Public Health. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050228214104/http://www.whatispublichealth.org/impact/index.html ''Impact of Public Health''.] Retrieved 2010-6-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and worldwide by six years since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

===Self-care strategies===
{{Main article|Self care}}
{{See also|Chronic care management|Social relation|Stress management}}
&lt;!--[[File:Nanogreens-2.gif|thumb|Example of [[nanogreens]] from health and hygiene.]] --&gt;
[[File:Borch Lady washing hands.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A lady washing her hands c. 1655]]
Personal health depends partially on the active, passive, and assisted cues people observe and adopt about their own health. These include personal actions for preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease, usually a chronic condition, through [[disease management (health)|integrative care]]. They also include personal [[hygiene]] practices to prevent infection and illness, such as [[bathing]] and [[washing hands]] with soap; [[oral hygiene|brushing and flossing teeth]]; storing, preparing and handling [[food safety|food safely]]; and many others. The information gleaned from personal [[Observations of Daily Living|observations of daily living]]&amp;nbsp;– such as about sleep patterns, exercise behavior, nutritional intake and environmental features&amp;nbsp;– may be used to inform personal decisions and actions (''e.g.'', "I feel tired in the morning so I am going to try sleeping on a different pillow"), as well as clinical decisions and treatment plans (''e.g.'', a patient who notices his or her shoes are tighter than usual may be having exacerbation of left-sided heart failure, and may require diuretic medication to reduce fluid overload).&lt;ref name="e-primer3"&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828125539/http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf ''Health in Everyday Living''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal health also depends partially on the social structure of a person's life. The maintenance of strong [[social relation]]ships, [[volunteering]], and other social activities have been linked to positive mental health and also increased longevity. One American study among [[old age|seniors]] over age 70, found that frequent volunteering was associated with reduced risk of dying compared with older persons who did not volunteer, regardless of physical health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris AH, Thoresen CE | title = Volunteering is Associated with Delayed Mortality in Older People: Analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Aging | journal = Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–52 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16176953 | doi = 10.1177/1359105305057310 | url = http://www.chce.research.va.gov/docs/pdfs/pi_publications/Harris/2005_Harris_Thoresen_JHS.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722153152/http://www.chce.research.va.gov/docs/pdfs/pi_publications/Harris/2005_Harris_Thoresen_JHS.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study from Singapore reported that volunteering retirees had significantly better [[cognition|cognitive performance]] scores, fewer [[mood disorder|depressive symptoms]], and better mental well-being and [[life satisfaction]] than non-volunteering retirees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwingel A, Niti MM, Tang C, Ng TP | title = Continued work employment and volunteerism and mental well-being of older adults: Singapore longitudinal ageing studies | journal = Age and Ageing | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 531–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19474036 | doi = 10.1093/ageing/afp089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolonged [[psychological stress]] may negatively impact health, and has been cited as a factor in [[cognitive impairment]] with aging, depressive illness, and expression of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McEwen BS | title = Protective and damaging effects of stress mediators: central role of the brain | journal = Dialogues Clin Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–81 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17290796 | pmc = 3181832 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stress management]] is the application of methods to either reduce stress or increase tolerance to stress. [[Relaxation technique]]s are physical methods used to relieve stress. Psychological methods include [[cognitive therapy]], [[meditation]], and [[Optimism|positive thinking]], which work by reducing response to stress. Improving relevant skills, such as [[problem solving]] and [[time management]] skills, reduces uncertainty and builds confidence, which also reduces the reaction to stress-causing situations where those skills are applicable.

==Occupational==
{{Main article|Occupational safety and health}}
In addition to [[safety]] risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common [[occupational diseases]] are various forms of [[pneumoconiosis]], including [[silicosis]] and [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis|coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease)]]. [[occupational asthma|Asthma]] is another [[respiratory illness]] that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including [[eczema]], [[dermatitis]], [[urticaria]], [[sunburn]], and [[skin cancer]].&lt;ref name=hse&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/skin/ HSE (Health and Safety Executive of Great Britain) Skin at work] Retrieved on June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="niosh-skin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skin Exposure &amp; Effects|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/|website=NIOSH Topics|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other occupational diseases of concern include [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] and [[lead poisoning]].

As the number of [[service sector]] jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with [[manufacturing]] and the [[primary sector]]. Contemporary problems, such as the growing rate of [[obesity]] and issues relating to [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and [[overwork]] in many countries, have further complicated the interaction between work and health.

Many governments view occupational health as a social challenge and have formed public organizations to ensure the health and safety of workers. Examples of these include the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Health and Safety Executive]] and in the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], which conducts research on occupational health and safety, and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], which handles regulation and policy relating to worker safety and health.&lt;ref name="niosh-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="osha-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hse-site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health and Safety Executive|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/|publisher=U.K. Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helicopter Underwater Escape Training''' (known as '''Helicopter Underwater Egress Training''' in the United States; often abbreviated '''HUET''', pronounced ''hue-wet'', ''hue-way'' or ''you-way'') is training provided to helicopter flight crews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtis|first1=Kate|last2=Ramsden|first2=Clair|title=Emergency and trauma care|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier Australia|location=Chatswood, N.S.W.|isbn=0729539822|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[offshore drilling|offshore oil and gas industry]] staff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Phil|last2=Playfoot|first2=Jim|title=Education and Training for the Oil and Gas Industry: Building A Technically Competent Workforce: 2 (The Getenergy Guides)|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780128010181}}&lt;/ref&gt; law enforcement personnel, and military personnel who are regularly transported by [[helicopter]]s over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Voogt|first1=Alex|last2=Van Doorn|first2=Robert R|title=The Paradox of Helicopter Emergency Training|journal=International Journal of Aviation Psychology|date=2007|volume=3|issue=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Survive A Helicopter Crash|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/how-survive-helicopter-crash-180953369/|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, the purpose is to prepare them for emergency exit in the case of a [[crash landing]] over water. While the training may be taken by crew and frequent passengers in all small aircraft that could ditch over water, a fixed wing aircraft such as a seaplane or small jet is not as prone to roll over as quickly or sink as rapidly as a helicopter with its main rotor on top of the aircraft. In addition, due to the slow speed of helicopters versus fixed wing aircraft and the lower height above the water, their cabins have a greater chance of being intact with passengers inside when ditched in the water.

==Overview==
The training involves [[simulated]] sinking in a pool while rotating the training module upside down and focuses students on bracing for impact, identifying primary and secondary exit points, avoiding [[smoke inhalation]], surfacing for air, and [[head count]]. The conventional simulators simulate an immersed cabin rotating around single axis, usually lengthwise. While the traditional simulators can only be turned left or right in the horizontal plane, the new generation simulators can turn 360° in both the horizontal and vertical planes. The HUET training aims to increase time-saving awareness of situational characteristics that can prevent successful escape, such as the role of the seat belt to control excess buoyancy caused by the safety suits inside the helicopter, how to operate the external breathing system, and to carefully store away excess seat belt length.

[[Royal Navy]] personnel train for helicopter emergency survival in water at [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton]] while [[United States Marine Corps]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] personnel train at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]], [[California]], [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], or [[Marine Corps Base Camp Hansen|Camp Hansen]], [[Okinawa, Japan]].

      <comment>The sentence was misleading and was not supported by the research. The research cited does not indicate the hunting reaction is maladaptive. Rather, the research indicates cold acclimiation reduces the effects of the hunting reaction.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3270">The '''hunting reaction''' or '''hunting response''' is a process of alternating [[vasoconstriction]] and [[vasodilation]] in [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]] exposed to cold. The term '''Lewis reaction''' is used too, named after [[Thomas Lewis (cardiologist)|Thomas Lewis]], who first described the effect in 1930.&lt;ref name="daanen" /&gt;

Vasoconstriction occurs first to reduce heat loss, but also results in strong cooling of the extremities. Approximately five to ten minutes after the start of cold exposure, the blood vessels in the extremities will suddenly vasodilate. This is probably caused by a sudden decrease in the release of [[neurotransmitter]]s from the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic nerves]] to the muscular coat of the [[Circulatory anastomosis|arteriovenous anastomoses]] due to local cold. This cold-induced vasodilation increases blood flow and subsequently the temperature of the fingers. A new phase of vasoconstriction follows the vasodilation, after which the process repeats itself.&lt;ref name="daanen" /&gt;

The hunting reaction is one out of four possible responses to immersion of the finger in cold water. The other responses observed in the fingers after immersion in cold water are a continuous state of vasoconstriction, slow steady and continuous rewarming and a proportional control form in which the blood vessel diameter remains constant after an initial phase of vasoconstriction. However, the vast majority of the vascular responses to immersion of the finger in cold water can be classified as the hunting reaction.&lt;ref name="daanen" /&gt;

There are many factors which influence the strength of the response. People who live or regularly work in cold environments show an increased response. Through [[acclimatization]] tropical residents can develop an increased response which is indistinguishable from arctic residents. The role of genetic factors is not clear because it is difficult to differentiate between [[adaptation]] and acclimatization.&lt;ref name="daanen" /&gt;

It was thought that the hunting reaction protected the fingers against [[frostbite|cold injury]] and improved muscle function in the fingers. An experiment has shown cold acclimation minimizes the hunting reaction (reduced mean temperature of the digits and a prolonged time of cold exposure prior to initial vasodilation), thus putting the hand at a greater risk of cold injury when it is exposed to cold.&lt;ref name="geurts2005" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4627">An '''infection rate''' (or incident rate) is the [[probability]] or [[risk]] of an [[infection]] in a [[population]]. It is used to measure the [[Rate (mathematics)|frequency of occurrence]] of new instances of infection within a population during a specific time period.

[[File:Infection rate formula.jpg|center|500px||A formula that describes the incidence of infection within a population]]

The number of infections equals the cases identified in the study or observed. An example might by [[HIV|HIV infection]] during a specific time period in the defined population. The population at risk are the cases appearing in the population during the same time period. An example would be all the people in a city during a specific time period. The constant, or K is assigned a value of 100 to represent a percentage. An example would be to find the percentage of people in a city who are infected with HIV: 6,000 cases in March divided by the population of a city (one million) multiplied by the constant (K) would give an infection rate of 0.6%.
.
Calculating the infection rate is used to analyze trends for the purpose of infection and disease control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Calculation of Infection Rates|url = http://health.utah.gov/epi/diseases/HAI/resources/Cal_Inf_Rates.pdf |publisher = Utah Department of Health|date= 2017| accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online infection rate calculator has been developed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] that allows the determination of the [[Streptococcus|Streptococcal A infection]] rate in a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Group A Streptococcus Calculator | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= 4 July 2008 |url = https://www2a.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/abcs/calc/calc_new/calculator.html 
| accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical applications==
[[Health facility|Health care facilities]] routinely track their infection rates according to the guidelines issued by the [[Joint Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Basic Statistical Data Used in Acute Care Facilities | publisher = JB Learning | url = http://www.jblearning.com/samples/0763750344/45561_CH01.pdf | accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hospital-acquired infection|healthcare-associated infection]] (HAI) rates measure infection of patients in a particular hospital. This allows rates to compared with other hospitals. These infections can often be [[Infection control|prevented]] when healthcare facilities follow guidelines for safe care. To get payment from [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], hospitals are required to report data about some infections to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Hospitals currently submit information on [[Central line-associated bloodstream infection|central line-associated bloodstream infections]] (CLABSIs), [[Catheter-associated urinary tract infection|catheter-associated urinary tract infections]] (CAUTIs), [[Surgical site infection|surgical site infections]] (SSIs), [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA Bacteremia]], and ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|C. difficile]]'' laboratory-identified events. The public reporting of these data is an effort by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) data | publisher = Medicare.gov| url = https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/Data/Healthcare-Associated-Infections.html | accessdate = 2017-01-09  }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For meaningful comparisons of infection rates, populations must be very similar between the two or more assessments. However, a problem with mean rates is that they cannot reflect differences in risk between populations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= NHSN Standardized Infection Ratio |url = https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps-analysis-resources/nhsn-sir-guide.pdf | accessdate = 2017-01-09 | date= December 2016 }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Digital Infrastructure for the Learning Health System: The Foundation for Continuous Improvement in Health and Health Care." Washington, DC: Institute of Medicine, 2011. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83569/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK83569.pdf] {{isbn|0-309-15416-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mclachlan"&gt;McLachlan S, Potts HWW, Dube K, Buchanan D, Lean S, Gallagher T, Johnson O, Daley B, Marsh W, Fenton N. "The Heimdall framework for supporting characterisation of learning health systems." ''J Innov Health Inform'' 2018;'''25'''(2):77–87. {{doi|10.14236/jhi.v25i2.996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was first conceptualised in a 2007 workshop organised by the US [[Institute of Medicine]], building on ideas around [[evidence-based medicine]]&lt;ref name="iom07" /&gt; and "practice-based evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Greene, S, and A Geiger. 2006. "A review finds that multicenter studies face substantial challenges but strategies exist to achieve Institutional Review Board approval." ''Journal of Clinical Epidemiology'' 59(8):784-790.&lt;/ref&gt; There has since been increasing interest in the topic, including the creation of the [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] journal ''Learning Health Systems''.&lt;ref name="mclachlan" /&gt;

LHS can be described as having four key elements:
#an organisational architecture that supports the formation of communities of patients, healthcare professionals and researchers who collaborate to produce and use "[[big data]]";
#large electronic health data sets, ''i.e.'' "big data";
#quality improvement at the point of care for each patient using new knowledge generated by research;
#research done in routine healthcare settings.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest C, Margolis P, Seid M and Colletti RB. PEDSnet: how a prototype pediatric learning health system is being expanded into a national network. Health Affairs 2014;33(7):1171–7&lt;/ref&gt;

They are thus dependent on the use of [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs) and have inherited the adoption challenges of EHRs.&lt;ref name="mclachlan" /&gt; 

LHS entail a clinical lifecycle. Patient data is collected, it is amalgamated across multiple patients and a problem is defined.&lt;ref&gt;"From Patient Data to Medical Knowledge: The Principles and Practice of Health Informatics" by Paul Taylor, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2007 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470994702]&lt;/ref&gt; These are activities largely driven by healthcare professionals. With the support of technology, an analysis is performed, which returns evidence, from which knowledge is generated, which leads to changed clinical practice, and thus to new patient data being collected.&lt;ref name="mclachlan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deeny S and Steventon A. Making sense of the shadows: Priorities for creating a learning healthcare system based on routinely collected data. BMJ Quality Safety 2015;24:505–15. {{doi|10.1136/bmjqs-2015-004278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abernethy A, Ahmad A, Zafar SY, Wheeler JL, Reese JB and Lyerly HK. Electronic patient-reported data capture as a foundation of rapid learning cancer care. Medical Care 2010;48(6):S32–8. {{doi|10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181db53a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLachlan and colleagues (2018) suggest a taxonomy of nine LHS classification types:&lt;ref name="mclachlan" /&gt;

Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sathish Subramanian |author2=Sayeeda Huq |author3=Tanya Yatsunenko |author4=Rashidul Haque |author5=Mustafa Mahfuz |author6=Mohammed A.

===Undernutrition and overnutrition===
Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which [[nutrient]]s are ''not enough'' or is ''too much'' such that it causes health problems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO, nutrition experts take action on malnutrition |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/pressnote_action_on_malnutrition/en/|work=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnutrition can result in [[obesity]] and being [[overweight]]. In some [[developing countries]], overnutrition in the form of [[obesity]] is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress For Children: A Report Card On Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Progress_for_Children_-_No._4.pdf|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation. Therefore, "malnutrition" in documents by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], [[Save the Children]] or other international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) usually is equated to undernutrition.

===Protein-energy malnutrition===

Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM).&lt;ref name="Young2012" /&gt; While other include both [[micronutrient deficiencies]] and protein energy malnutrition in its definition.&lt;ref name="Jones2011" /&gt; It differs from [[calorie restriction]] in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051473|hypoalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "severe malnutrition" or "severe undernutrition" is often used to refer specifically to [[protein–energy malnutrition|PEM]].&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last3=Walker |editor-first3=W. Allan |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Duggan |editor-first2=John B. |editor-last2=Watkins |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Two forms of PEM are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], and they commonly coexist.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt;

==== Kwashiorkor ====
[[Kwashiorkor]] is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt; The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="listeningga"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast|author=Stanton J|year=2001|journal=Clio Medica: Studies in the History of Medicine and Health|volume=61|pages=149–71|pmid=11603151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marasmus====
[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt;

===Undernutrition, hunger===
Undernutrition encompasses [[stunted growth]] (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.&lt;ref name="Black2008" /&gt;

===Definition by Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. D.|author2=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.&lt;ref name="Grover 2009" /&gt; The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011" /&gt; An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.&lt;ref name="Gueri 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gueri |first1=M.|author2=J. M. Gurney, P. Jutsum|title=The gomez classification.

===Definition by Waterlow===
[[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt; Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref name="J. C. Waterlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2010|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt;

Lower energy and impaired function of the brain also represent the downward spiral of malnutrition as victims are less able to perform the tasks they need to in order to acquire food, earn an income, or gain an education.

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy, limpness, convulsion, or loss of consciousness. If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly, perform a finger or heel stick.

==Causes==

[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]], 1865]]
Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotso | first1 = J.

===Dietary practices===

==== Undernutrition ====
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes contributed to malnutrition and continued three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=June 2012 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal malnutrition can also factor into the poor health or death of a baby. Over 800,000 [[neonatal death]] have occurred because of deficient growth of the fetus in the mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261533.php|title=Malnutrition Kills Over 3 Million Children Annually Worldwide|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.&lt;ref name=Burchi&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=February 2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |vauthors=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as [[vitamin A deficiency]], [[iron deficiency]] or [[zinc deficiency]] can also increase risk of death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2148 Improving Child Nutrition - The achievable imperative for global progress]. UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overnutrition ====
Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A child with extreme malnutrition]]

In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.&lt;ref name=Gardner00&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.&lt;ref name=Sen81&gt;{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BzU_AwAAQBAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[biofuel]]s as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuel use increasing poverty |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= June 25, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7472532.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on the right to food, [[Jean Ziegler]] proposes that agricultural waste, such as corn cobs and banana leaves, rather than crops themselves be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuels 'crime against humanity' |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= October 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm |first=Grant |last=Ferrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= February 6, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneers [[Norman Borlaug]] and Keith Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

[[Global warming]] is of importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=November 12–17, 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. October 27, 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |newspaper=BBC News; Science &amp; Environment |date=August 9, 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colony collapse disorder]] is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aginfo.psu.edu/news/2007/1/HoneyBees.htm Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop growers and researchers]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees]], this represents a threat to the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanishing bees threaten US crops |newspaper=BBC News |date= March 11, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

{{Main|Food security}}
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in increased [[food production]] and corresponding decreases in prices and malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= October 10, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country has one of the highest  prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=John Ulimwengu|title=Need in a land of planty |publisher= dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/spite-drcs-huge-agricultural-potential-many-people-lack-vital-nutrients|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents for investing in agriculture include [[Jeffrey Sachs]], who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa’s farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion |agency= |work= The New York Times|newspaper= |date=July 9, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Celia W. |last2=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to treat malnutrition in the North. ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans may also be used.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Jiming, Yeyun Xin and Longping Yuan. (2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

===Economics===
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|date=June 4, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|date=December 8, 2008|publisher=World Food Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|archivedate=February 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients" /&gt; Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York), July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
[[Food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s address malnutrition in places where people lack money to buy food.  A [[basic income]] has been proposed as a way to ensure that everyone has enough money to buy food and other basic needs; it is a form of [[social security]] in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2|title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble|date=May 6, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5" /&gt;

===World population===

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through "moral restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = R. | title = No room at the inn, or why population problems are not all economic | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 21 | pages = 81–97 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02436122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependence and complementarity of population growth with poverty and malnutrition (as well as the environment) is also recognised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/environment/index.shtml|title=Environment - United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 million women worldwide do not have adequate access to family planning services. According to the World Health Organisation, "Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation."&lt;ref name="Sen81" /&gt; 

===Food sovereignty===

{{Main|Food sovereignty}}
One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]]—the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems, in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market.

===Health facilities===

Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Penny | first2 = M.

===Breastfeeding===

As of 2016 is estimated that about 821,000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Lancet2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victora|first1=CG|last2=Bahl|first2=R|last3=Barros|first3=AJ|last4=França|first4=GV|last5=Horton|first5=S|last6=Krasevec|first6=J|last7=Murch|first7=S|last8=Sankar|first8=MJ|last9=Walker|first9=N|date=January 30, 2016|title=Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect.|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10017|pages=475–90|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7|pmid=26869575|last10=Rollins|first10=NC|last11=Lancet Breastfeeding Series|first11=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reducing infant death, breast milk feeding provides an important source of micronutrients, clinically proven to bolster the immune system of children, and provide long-term defenses against non-communicable and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessen|first=Rachelle|last2=Kavanagh|first2=Katherine|date=2015-03-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01876-0/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=115|issue=3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014|pmid=25721389|issn=2212-2672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding has also been shown to improve cognitive abilities in children, with a strong correlation to individual educational achievements.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi Omobolanle|last2=Dagvadorj|first2=Amarjagal|last3=Anigo|first3=Kola Mathew|last4=Ota|first4=Erika|last5=Sasaki|first5=Satoshi|date=2015-10-01|title=Factors influencing breastfeeding exclusivity during the first 6 months of life in developing countries: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–451|doi=10.1111/mcn.12180|pmid=25857205|issn=1740-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, lack of proper breastfeeding is a major factor in child mortality rates, and a primary determinant of disease development for children. The medical community recommends exclusively breastfeeding infants for 6 months, with nutritional whole food supplementation and continued breastfeeding up to 2 years or older for overall optimal health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Linda C.|last2=Milligan|first2=Renee A.|last3=Frick|first3=Kevin D.|last4=Spatz|first4=Diane|last5=Bronner|first5=Yvonne|date=2002-06-01|title=Breastfeeding Duration, Costs, and Benefits of a Support Program for Low-Income Breastfeeding Women|journal=Birth|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=95–100|doi=10.1046/j.1523-536X.2002.00169.x|pmid=12000411|issn=1523-536X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai|first=Xiaodong|last2=Wardlaw|first2=Tessa|last3=Brown|first3=David W.|date=2012-09-28|title=Global trends in exclusive breastfeeding|journal=International Breastfeeding Journal|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1746-4358-7-12|pmid=23020813|pmc=3512504|issn=1746-4358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as only giving an infant breast milk for six months as a source of food and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; This means no other liquids, including water or semi-solid foods.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

==== Barriers to breastfeeding ====

Breastfeeding is noted as one of the most cost effective medical interventions for providing beneficial child health.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; While there are considerable differences within developed and developing countries: income, employment, social norms, and access to healthcare were found to be universal determinants of whether a mother breast or formula fed their children.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Community based healthcare workers have helped alleviate financial barriers faced by newly made mothers, and provided a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospital based medical care.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995-2010 shows exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up globally, from 33% to 39%.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Despite the growth rates, medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===Global initiatives===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Food security and global malnutrition has long been a topic of international concern, with one of the first official global documents addressing it being the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR). Within this document it stated that access to food was part of an adequate right to a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Right to food]] was asserted in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], a [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 16, 1966. The Right to food is a [[human rights|human right]] for people to feed themselves in dignity, be free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.righttofood.org/work-of-jean-ziegler-at-the-un/what-is-the-right-to-food/|title=What is the Right to Food? {{!}} Right to food|website=www.righttofood.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the treaty has been signed by 166 countries, by signing states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve the right to adequate food.

However, after the 1966 International Covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present, leading to the first ever World Food Conference that was held in 1974 in Rome, Italy. The [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] was a UN resolution adopted November 16, 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-legally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem. Ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger.

Adoption of the right to food was included in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], this 1978 document was adopted by many countries in the Americas, the purpose of the document is, "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr.html|title=American Convention on Human Rights|website=www.hrcr.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next document in the timeline of global inititaves for malnutrition was the 1996 [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]], organized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. This document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritous food by everyone, also considering that everyone gets sufficient food, and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halfing their amount of undernourished people by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|title=Rome Declaration and Plan of Action|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization adopted the  [[Right to Food Guidelines]], which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx Outcome of the 2012 Copenhagen Consensus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], approved through the UN in 2015. In particular Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/ Description and targets for Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition. 2015.

In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program will initiatilly be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Press release.

Accessed on 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

In response to child malnutrition, the [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition. They are to prevent or treat [[dehydration]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], infection, correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies, start feeding cautiously, achieve catch-up growth, provide psychological support, and prepare for discharge and follow-up after recovery.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

Among those who are hospitalized, nutritional support improves protein, calorie intake and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=MR|last2=Blaser Yildirim|first2=PZ|last3=Bounoure|first3=L|last4=Gloy|first4=VL|last5=Mueller|first5=B|last6=Briel|first6=M|last7=Schuetz|first7=P|date=January 1, 2016|title=Nutritional Support and Outcomes in Malnourished Medical Inpatients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.6587|pmid=26720894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
The evidence for benefit of supplementary feeding is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sguassero|first1=Y|last2=de Onis|first2=M|last3=Bonotti|first3=AM|last4=Carroli|first4=G|date=Jun 13, 2012|title=Community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the growth of children under five years of age in low and middle income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD005039|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005039.pub3|pmid=22696347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the small amount of research done on this treatment.

Specially formulated foods do however appear useful in those from the developing world with moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Lazzer2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazzerini|first1=M|last2=Rubert|first2=L|last3=Pani|first3=P|date=Jun 21, 2013|title=Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009584|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2|pmid=23794237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In young children with severe acute malnutrition it is unclear if [[ready-to-use therapeutic food]] differs from a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoonees|first1=A|last2=Lombard|first2=M|last3=Musekiwa|first3=A|last4=Nel|first4=E|last5=Volmink|first5=J|date=Jun 6, 2013|title=Ready-to-use therapeutic food for home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children from six months to five years of age.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009000|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009000.pub2|pmid=23744450}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have some benefits in humanitarian emergencies as they can be eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with clean water, and can be stored for years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8114750.stm|title=Firms target nutrition for the poor|last=Anderson|first=Tatum|date=June 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=BBC News|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those who are severely malnourished, feeding too much too quickly can result in [[refeeding syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Via2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viana Lde|first1=A|last2=Burgos|first2=MG|last3=Silva Rde|first3=A|date=Jan–Mar 2012|title=Refeeding syndrome: clinical and nutritional relevance.|journal=Arquivos Brasileiros de Cirurgia Digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian Archives of Digestive Surgery|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–9|pmid=22569981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result regardless of route of feeding and can present itself a couple of days after eating with [[heart failure]], [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s and confusion that can result in death.&lt;ref name="Via2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boateng|first1=AA|last2=Sriram|first2=K|last3=Meguid|first3=MM|last4=Crook|first4=M|date=Feb 2010|title=Refeeding syndrome: treatment considerations based on collective analysis of literature case reports.|journal=Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)|volume=26|issue=2|pages=156–67|doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.11.017|pmid=20122539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

For example, flour has been fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Micronutrients===
Treating malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html|title=Raising the world's IQ|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.&lt;ref name="hiddenhunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24kristof.html|title=The Hidden Hunger|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=May 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=New York Times|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|work=|newspaper=Newsweek|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with diarrhea, once an initial four-hour rehydration period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.  See especially Ch. 4 "Management of Acute Diarrhoea (Without Blood)" and Ch. 8 "Management of Diarrhoea With Severe Malnutrition."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008, page 18 (19 in PDF) and following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration,&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; and including foods rich in potassium as above. [[Hypokalemia|Low blood potassium]] is worsened when base (as in Ringer's/Hartmann's) is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; As above, available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water, salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a child's diarrhea along with continued eating.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;  Vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause, this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas, green coconut water, and unsweetened fresh fruit juice.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;

===Diarrhea===

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called [[oral rehydration solution]] (ORS).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The oral rehydration solution is both slightly [[sweet]] and slightly [[salt]]y and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; Fluids by [[nasogastric tube]] may be use in those who do not drink.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; [[Intravenous]] fluids are recommended only in those who have [[Shock (circulatory)|significant dehydration]] due to their potential complications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; These complications include [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Over time, ORS developed into [[Oral rehydration therapy|ORT]], or [[oral rehydration therapy]], which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar|last2=Bryce|first2=Jennifer|date=Jan 2000|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000001000010&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1246–1255|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000001000010|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast feeding and eating should resume as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Drinks such as soft drinks, fruit juices, or sweetened teas are not recommended as they contain too much sugar and may worsen diarrhea.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title=The Treatment of diarrhoea : a manual for physicians and other senior health  workers.|date=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=924159318 0|edition=4|location=Geneva|pages=8–16|chapter=4. Management of acute diarrhoea without blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broad spectrum antibiotic]]s are recommended in all severely undernourished children with diarrhea requiring admission to hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

To prevent dehydration readily available fluids, preferably with a modest amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless there are signs of swelling.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4" /&gt; A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for children under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended a reduced-[[osmolarity]] ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4950e/2.4.html WHO Drug Information Vol. 16, No. 2, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/ors/low-osmolarity-ors.htm Low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS)], Rehydrate Project, updated: April 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For general use, one packet of ORS (glucose sugar, salt, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate) is added to one liter of water; however, for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], WHO, 2005.  Specifically, 45 milliliters of potassium chloride solution from a stock solution containing 100g KCl per liter, along with one packet of ORS, ''&lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt;'' liters of water, and 50 grams of sucrose.  And please remember, sucrose has approximately twice the molecular weight of glucose, with one mole of glucose weighing 180 g and one mole of sucrose weighing 342 g.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;  Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water (34 oz.) and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 1/2, with perhaps most sources recommending 1/2 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241592330.pdf "Guidelines for the control of shigellosis, including epidemics due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1".] World Health Organization, 2005, Annex 12 - Preparation of Home Made Oral Rehydration Solution, page 51 (57 in PDF): "Ingredients: Half a teaspoon of salt (2.5 grams), six level teaspoons of sugar (30 grams) and one litre of safe drinking water".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/treatment/con-20030056 "Dehydration, treatments and drugs."] Mayo Clinic January 7, 2011.

===Low blood sugar===
[[Hypoglycemia]], whether known or suspected, can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water. If the child is conscious, the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh] recommends, for initial hypoglycemia, a 50 milliliter bolus of 10% glucose or sucrose.  This can also be achieved by added 1 rounded teaspoon of sugar to 10.5 teaspoons of water (which is 3.5 tablespoons of water).&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is unconscious, give glucose by [[intravenous]] or [[nasogastric tube]]. If seizures occur after despite glucose, rectal [[diazepam]] is recommended. Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

===Hypothermia===
[[Hypothermia]] can occur. To prevent or treat this, the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child. Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided. Warming methods are usually most important at night.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to ''undernutrition'' even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.

The [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries’ hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8306556.stm |title= Global hunger worsening, warns UN |publisher= BBC (Europe) |date= 14 October 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report shows that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remain at serious or alarming levels. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2015 report include an article on conflict and food security.&lt;ref&gt;K. von Grebmer, J. Bernstein, A. de Waal, N. Prasai, S. Yin, Y.

In 2010 [[protein-energy malnutrition]] resulted in 600,000 deaths down from 883,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lozano R, Naghavi M, Foreman K, etal |title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 |journal=Lancet |volume=380 |issue=9859 |pages=2095–128 |date=December 2012  |pmid=23245604 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0 |url=|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nutritional deficiencies, which include [[iodine deficiency]] and [[iron deficiency anemia]], result in another 84,000 deaths.&lt;ref name="Loz2012" /&gt; In 2010 malnutrition caused about 1.5 million deaths in women and children.&lt;ref name="Lim2012" /&gt;

Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of [[vitamin A]] or [[zinc]], for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition in the first two years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously{{when|date=September 2016}} seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

==History ==
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often experienced sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. For the first few decades after [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2000 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people. According to the WFP some statistics are that, "Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished."&lt;ref name="wfp.org Hunger Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Statistics|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|website=World Food Programme|publisher=wfp.org|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2006, the average international price of food had been largely stable for several decades. In the closing months of 2006, however, prices began to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rise rapidly]]. By 2008, rice had tripled in price in some regions, and this severely affected [[developing countries]]. Food prices fell in early 2009, but rose to another record high in 2011, and have since decreased slightly. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2012|2008 worldwide financial crisis]] further increased the number of people suffering from hunger, including dramatic increases even in advanced economies such as [[Great Britain]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]].

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] included a commitment to a further 50% reduction in the proportion of the world's population who have extreme hunger by 2015. As of 2012, this target appeared difficult to achieve, due in part to persistent inflation in food prices. However, in late 2012 the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) stated it is still possible to hit the target with sufficient effort. In 2013, the ''FAO'' estimated that 842 million people are undernourished (12% of the global population). Malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 3.1 million children under 5 every year. [[UNICEF]] estimates 300 million children go to bed hungry each night; and that 8000 children under the age of 5 are estimated to die of malnutrition every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C. Madu|title=Investment and Development Will Secure the Rights of the Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and earlier===
Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally,&lt;ref&gt;As an example of historical opposition to food aid, during the [[Hungry Forties]], English [[Laissez-faire]] advocates were largely successful in preventing it being deployed by Great Britain to relief the Irish famine; see for example the section on "Ideology and relief"' in Chpt. 2 of ''The Great Irish Famine'' by [[Cormac Ó Gráda]].

For a detailed description of how views opposed to hunger relief became dominant within Great Britain's policy making circles during the 19th century, and also their subsequent displacement, see ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007) by James Vernon, esp. Chpts. 1–3. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp programme, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals. ( See [http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/14/4099922/food-stamp-debate-brings-out-the.html Food stamp debate brings out the haters] published by the ''Star Telegram''. )&lt;/ref&gt; recognized.

The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human [[Moral obligation|obligations]]. She says that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that [[Social progress]] is commonly held to be first of all, "...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=The Need for Roots|page = 6|year=2002 |orig-year= 1942|isbn=978-0-415-27102-8|publisher = [[Routledge]]|title-link=The Need for Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Karl Polanyi]] | title = The Great Transformation | year = 2002 |orig-year=1942 | chapter = chpt. 4  | isbn = 978-0-8070-5643-1  | publisher=Beacon Press | title-link = The Great Transformation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for people to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007), James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists, with some academics and politicians also calling for or organizing intervention against world hunger, such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book |author = James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History |chapter = Chpts. 1-3|year= 2007|isbn=978-0674026780 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945–1980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981

===Great Depression===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|210px|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931|upright=1.15]]
Hunger as an academic and social topic came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called "the paradox of want amid plenty," agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Janet Poppendieck | title = Eating Agendas | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0 | publisher=Aldine Transaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Martin Luther King]] (center), one of many twentieth century political figures who considered it important to fight hunger: "When I die, don't build a monument to me. Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry." &lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;]]
After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]].

For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"&gt;{{cite book |author = John R. Butterly and Jack Shepherd |title=Hunger: The Biology and Politics of Starvation|year= 2010|isbn=978-1584659266 |publisher= Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas.

WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. Despite this view, during the 1960s postwar era hunger within the United States was overshadowed by hunger in Europe and Asia. John F. Kennedy did in fact use Executive Order to double the amount of commodities available from the surplus commodity program as well as initiated the pilot Food Stamp Program which later became permanent in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Donna|last2=Poppendieck|first2=Janet|title=Eating agendas : food and nutrition as social problems|date=1995|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=9780202305073|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"/&gt;
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]
Organizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the "[[free trade]]" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond|publisher= [[World Bank]]|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"&gt;[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"&gt;Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.&lt;ref name="foodAndFamine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens |author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans|title=The Globalization of World Politics|chapter = "Poverty, development and hunger"|year= 2010|isbn=978-0199569090 |publisher= [[Oxford University press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a ''global food crisis'', increasing the numbers suffering from hunger by over a hundred million. [[Food riot]]s erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, [[Haiti]] and [[Madagascar]], this led to the toppling of governments. A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="Politics of hunger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G202012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"&gt;{{cite news|

As of 2008 roughly $300 million of aid went to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In contrast, at that time [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which caused fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In 2008 UN estimated that ending world hunger could cost about 30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html|title=UN says solving food crisis could cost $30 billion|first=Elisabeth Rosenthal and Andrew|last=Martin|date=2008-06-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]), a member of the [[CGIAR]] consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, such as [[chickpea]], [[groundnut]], [[pigeonpea]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]]. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of [[eleusine coracana|finger millet]] in [[Tanzania]] by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Paul Bossuet, ''Nourishing Communities Through Holistic Farming'' {{cite web|url=http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}.

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university-level institutions. Health and nutrition have been proven to have close links with overall educational success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/wbro/11.1.23|jstor=3986477|title=The Impact of Health and Nutrition on Education|author=Jere R.

In the early 21st century, there was relatively little awareness of hunger from leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the [[G8]].&lt;ref name="G202012"/&gt; Prior to 2009, efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.&lt;ref&gt;

Food prices did fall sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations, and was a prominent part of the agenda for the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit|2012 G-20 summit]].&lt;ref name="G202012"&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] launched a "new alliance for food security and nutrition"—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to "...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2343978/uk_aid_is_financing_a_corporate_scramble_for_africa.html UK 'aid' is financing a corporate scramble for Africa], Miriam Ross, ''[[The Ecologist]]'', 2014.04.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "2012G8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity/190282.htm G8 Action on Food Security and Nutrition] 2012 statement hosted by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/remarks-president-symposium-global-agriculture-and-food-security Remarks by President concerning the launch of the ''new alliance for food security and nutrition'']&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]] held a [[2012 Olympic hunger summit|hunger summit]] on 12 August, the last day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="2012G8"/&gt;

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]].

This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.&lt;ref&gt;

Europe, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity.

By July 2012, the [[2012 US drought]] had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world's biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The ''Financial Times'' reported that the [[BRICS]] may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and [[G20]] has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US drought"&gt;

Undernutrition is an important determinant of maternal and child health, accounting for more than a third of child deaths and more than 10 percent of the total global [[disease burden]] according to 2008 studies.&lt;ref name="Black2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = R.

The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide,&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; about 1 million children.&lt;ref name="ENJM013113"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manary|first1=Mark J. |author2=Indi Trehan |author3=Hayley S.

(2008). [http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/saferwater/en/ Safer water, better health - Costs, benefits and sustainability of interventions to protect and promote health]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

As underweight children are more vulnerable to almost all infectious diseases, the ''indirect'' disease burden of malnutrition is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than the disease burden of the ''direct'' effects of malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The combination of direct and indirect deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene ([[WASH]]) practices is estimated to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Women===

{{main article|Food security#Gender and food security}}
[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]
Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt. This changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;
[[File:Starved_girl.jpg|thumb|183x183px|Starved girl]]

Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; These small-scale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of undernutrition were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nubé | first1 = M. | last2 = Van Den Boom | first2 = G. J.

Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt;

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh, Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Najma Rizvi |publisher=dandc.eu |title=Enduring misery |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/bangladesh-does-not-guarantee-food-security-demanded-its-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;  Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Physiology====
Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=https://www.uthfa.com/gender-nutrition-2001/|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations |accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in [[developing countries]] and increased the risk of death during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z. A. | last2 = Ahmed | first2 = T. | last3 = Black | first3 = R. E. | last4 = Cousens | first4 = S. | last5 = Dewey | first5 = K. | last6 = Giugliani | first6 = E. | last7 = Haider | first7 = B.

Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Educating children====
According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;

===Elderly===

[[File:Medical alert bracelet 2.jpg|alt=A metal bracelet, engraved with a short list of important medical information, and decorated with a red symbol representing medicine|thumb|400x400px|A medical alert bracelet]]
A '''medical identification tag''' is a small [[emblem]] or tag worn on a [[bracelet]], [[neck chain]], or on the clothing bearing a message that the wearer has an important [[medical condition]] that might require immediate attention. The tag is often made out of [[stainless steel]] or [[sterling silver]]. The intention is to alert a [[paramedic]], physician, [[emergency department]] personnel or other [[certified first responder|first responders]] ([[emergency medical services]], [[community first responder]], [[Emergency medical responder]]) of the condition even if the wearer is not conscious enough, old enough, or too injured to explain. A wallet [[Identity document|card]] with the same information may be used instead of or along with a tag, and a stick-on medical ID tag may be added or used alone.

A type of medic identification alert is the USB medical alert tag, essentially a USB flash drive with capacity to store a great deal of emergency information, including contacts and medical conditions. This information is accessible by any computer with a USB port. However, the practical effectiveness of such a system is limited in many cases by medical computer systems that restrict the use of USB devices which may carry malware. It is also possible that a device carried by an unconscious person may not be their own, or not be up to date, with concomitant risks to health and legal liability of medical personnel.

Another new type of medic identification alert is [[QR code]] based medical alert stickers. The QR code on the sticker links to a [[web service]] that contains the individual's emergency information. The information is accessed by any first responder or emergency personnel by scanning the QR code by using a [[smartphone]]. Since a web service is used to store the information there is normally no limitation of how much information that can be stored.

==Conditions for use==
Typical conditions warranting wearing of such a tag are:

==Information provided==
{{Main article|In case of emergency}}
In addition to mention of the relevant medical condition(s), the tag may have a telephone number that medical personnel can call for more information, for example that of physician, care-giver or [[next of kin]]. Where applicable and provided, the wearer's national health service user number can enable access to a more detailed case history. Basically, the medical information tag, engraved with the wearer's personal medical problem or history, speak for the wearer when the wearer can't. Incidentally and where the symptoms can mislead, such a tag may also be useful as evidence of such a condition to law enforcement personnel.

There are various types of medical ID&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Medical ID That Comes With a Free Medical Profile|url=https://shop.getmyid.com|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; available. The most common form of medical ID is jewelry which provides a logo or inscription indicating a particular medical condition. These medical identification tags can be made out of stainless steel (usually classified as 316L and known as [[Stainless steel#Stainless steel grades|surgical stainless steel]]), sterling silver or gold. If found by emergency personnel the inscription provides an indication of your special medical needs. Tags are available with pre-engraved conditions or can be custom engraved with your specific medical histories and have the benefit of that all information is self-contained and does not require any form of technology to view in case of an emergency.

Another type of medical ID jewelry indicates membership in a medical information organization such as the [[MedicAlert]] Foundation, and American Medical ID. Such medical ID jewelry includes a member identification number and a toll-free number for medical emergency personnel to contact the organization and obtain full information about the wearer's medical conditions, treatment, and history. These organizations maintain a database of medical information on their members and can provide it to medical personnel when requested.

The newest technology allows the user to carry stickers with an [[NFC Tag]]. A similar technology allows the user to carry stickers with a [[QR code]]. By scanning the NFC Tag or the QR code with a smartphone, you will reach the stored medical alert information. Apple's IOS 8 operating system includes the facility for a mobile phone to contain the owner's medical emergency information.

Silicone bracelets, preprinted with a general medical condition or allergy, are also popular. The lack of personalization may be a deterrent. Recently patients have begun to "tattoo" their medical condition on their wrist or arm. Although a permanent tattoo might be considered, a temporary tattoo works as well. Other items include stick on tags that stick onto a driver's license, wallet, or cell phone which are practical for the person who does not want to carry something extra advertising their medical condition.

Another type of medical jewelry is a pendant or wrist strap containing a wireless alert button, also known as a panic button, worn in the home as part of a wireless medical alert system. This type of medical jewelry sends a signal to a dialing console which contacts a [[medical alarm]] monitoring service or directly dials first responders when an emergency occurs.

===Machine-readable devices===
Devices marked "ICE" which can hold a significant amount of data and are readable by a computer are sold, typically [[USB]] [[USB flash drive|flash drives]] with password-protected data entry providing [[File system permissions|read-only]] access to emergency medical data. However, it has been pointed out by a staff nurse with experience in trauma and critical care that such devices are worse than useless, at least in most situations in the UK, as medical computer systems are designed not to accept USB storage devices due to the risk of [[computer virus]]es. Additionally, there is no guarantee that ICE information even pertains to an unconscious person carrying it; using incorrect information can lead to patient harm and legal liability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8418">'''Mental health in Southeast Africa''' is a concern, where mental illness is prevalent. [[Mental health]] issues in Africa are often viewed as the "silent crisis" since they are often given lower priority in a region of Africa where international aid is focused on communicable diseases and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Gureje, O., &amp; Alem, A. (2000). Mental health policy development in Africa. ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization,'' 78(4), 475-482. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each country in [[Southeast Africa]] is consistently confronted with barriers that make mental health policies a challenge to implement, including the lack of policy, social and cultural barriers, the role of traditional medicine, [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV/AIDS]], and the stigma surrounding mental health issues.

== Priority of mental health ==
Professor Anyang' Nyong'o wrote a letter on June 23, 2011 to the Kenyan National Commission of Human Rights, stating, "Currently there is a very big gap existing between the mental health needs of Kenyans and the existing mental health services at all levels of the health care services delivery system."&lt;ref&gt;Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. (2011). ''Silenced minds: The systemic neglect of the mental health system in Kenya.'' Nairobi: Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.

Although there is a lack of attention to mental health in the healthcare systems, it is a major issue in Southeast African countries. Efforts have been made in some countries to allocate funding to mental health initiatives. [[Uganda]]'s policies are a prime example of a successful effort to improve mental health in [[Southeast Africa]]. In 2006–2007, after undertaking an initial situational analysis of Uganda's mental health system, a new mental health policy was created.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ssebunnya | first1 = J. | last2 = Kigozi | first2 = F. | last3 = Ndyanabangi | first3 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Developing a national mental health policy: A case study from Uganda | url = | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 10 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision for the project in Uganda is to eliminate, mental health issues, neurological disorders, and substance use from the population. From this vision, guiding principles were implemented, key priority areas were identified, policy objectives were selected, and the Uganda Ministry of Health began to make mental health a priority.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) continues to work with the developing nations of Africa to implement strategies to improve mental health situations and treatment in these countries. The few countries that have mental health policies in place, were created prior to 1990, and are in dire need of updating.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders &amp; Uganda National Academy of Sciences Forum on Health and Nutrition (2010).

Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53436/&lt;/ref&gt;  Uganda had achieved great success with their new mental health policies and is working in close cooperation with the WHO to finalize their health-care policy. The WHO is working to move other countries' mental health policies forward.

== Perspectives ==
The Southeast [[African Great Lakes]] region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness.  According to Vikram Patel, a [[global mental health]] expert and professor at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]], the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anthea Gordon |url=http://thinkafricapress.com/health/mental-health-remains-invisible-problem-africa |title=Mental Health Remains An Invisible Problem in Africa |publisher=Think Africa Press |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005149/http://thinkafricapress.com/health/mental-health-remains-invisible-problem-africa |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For an example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others.&lt;ref&gt;Omonzejele, F.

Retrieved from http://www.eubios.info/EJ145/ej145d.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[CNN]] series, ''African Voices'', leading psychiatrist Frank Njenga, states that when a patient has some form of illness such as depression or schizophrenia, community members and traditional healers often look at it as being possessed by demons or witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian, L., McKenzie, D., &amp; Ellis, J.

== Causes of mental illnesses ==
Some mental illnesses have been linked to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters help nerve cells in the brain communicate. If these chemicals are out of balance or are not working properly, messages may not properly transmit through the brain, leading to symptoms of mental illness. In addition, defects in or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) to areas of the brain have also been linked to some mental conditions.

Many socioeconomic factors may contribute to mental health. Such as, disease, political unrest, violence, and any kind of addiction. These may all play a role in the high incident of mental illness in Southeast Africa. Adequate care may not be available to sufferers, due to the stigma that surrounds people dealing with mental illness. The reversal of this stigma, is due to the lack of educational resources .&lt;ref&gt;Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. (2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33770">[[File:STS-130 Endeavour flyaround 5.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[International Space Station]] in [[orbit]] around [[Earth]], February 2010. The ISS is in a '''micro-g environment'''.]]

The term '''micro-g environment''' (also '''µg''', often referred to by the term '''microgravity''') is more or less a synonym for ''[[weightlessness]]'' and ''zero-g'', but indicates that [[g-force]]s are not quite zero—just very small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/myth.html |title=Space myths and misconceptions – space flight |journal=[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]] |date=May 1993 |volume=15 |number=7 |page=38ff}}&lt;!-- alternate link: http://lab.machinecode.org/intricate/omni_magazine/Omni%20v15%20%237%20May%201993.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol for microgravity, ''µg'', was used on the insignias of [[Space Shuttle]] flights [[STS-87]] and [[STS-107]], because these flights were devoted to microgravity research in [[low Earth orbit]].

==Absence of gravity==
A "stationary" micro-g environment&lt;ref&gt;Depending on distance, "stationary" is meant relative to Earth or the Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; would require travelling far enough into deep space so as to reduce the effect of gravity by [[attenuation]] to almost zero. This is the simplest in conception, but requires traveling an enormous distance, rendering it most impractical. For example, to reduce the gravity of the Earth by a factor of one million, one needs to be at a distance of 6 million kilometers from the Earth, but to reduce the gravity of the Sun to this amount one has to be at a distance of 3.7 billion kilometers. (On Earth the gravity due to the rest of the [[Milky Way]] is already attenuated by a factor greater than one million, so we do not need to move away further from its [[Galactic Center|center]]{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}). Thus it is not impossible, but it has only been achieved so far by four [[interstellar probe]]s ([[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]] of the [[Voyager program]], and [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11|11]] of the [[Pioneer program]]&lt;!-- [[New Horizons]] it's expected to do so in the near future--&gt;) and they did not return to Earth. To reduce the gravity to one thousandth of that on Earth's  surface, one needs to be at a distance of 200,000&amp;nbsp;km.

At a distance relatively close to Earth (less than 3000&amp;nbsp;km), gravity is only slightly reduced. As an object orbits a body such as the Earth, gravity is still attracting objects towards the Earth and the object is accelerated downward at almost 1g. Because the objects are typically moving laterally with respect to the surface at such immense speeds, the object will not lose altitude because of the curvature of the Earth. When viewed from an orbiting observer, other close objects in space appear to be floating because everything is being pulled towards Earth at the same speed, but also moving forward as the Earth's surface "falls" away below. All these objects are in free fall, not zero gravity.

Compare the [[Gravitational potential#Numerical values|gravitational potential at some of these locations]].

==Free fall==
What remains is a micro-g environment moving in [[free fall]], i.e. there are no forces other than gravity acting on the people or objects in this environment. To prevent air drag making the free fall less perfect, objects and people can free-fall in a capsule that itself, while not necessarily in free fall, is accelerated as in free fall.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This can be done by applying a force to compensate for air drag. Alternatively free fall can be carried out in space, or in a vacuum tower or shaft.

Two cases can be distinguished: Temporary micro-g, where after some time the Earth's surface is or would be reached, and indefinite micro-g.

A temporary micro-g environment exists in a [[drop tube]] (in a tower or shaft), a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]], e.g. with a [[sounding rocket]], and in an airplane such as used by [[NASA]]'s Reduced Gravity Research Program, aka the [[Vomit Comet]], and by the [[Zero Gravity Corporation]]. A temporary micro-g environment is applied for training of astronauts, for some experiments, for filming movies, and for recreational purposes.

A micro-g environment for an indefinite time, while also possible in a spaceship going to infinity in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit, is most practical in an Earth orbit. This is the environment commonly experienced in the [[International Space Station]], [[Space Shuttle]], etc. While this scenario is the most suitable for scientific experimentation and commercial exploitation, it is still quite expensive to operate in, mostly due to launch costs.

==Tidal and inertial acceleration==

Objects in orbit are not perfectly weightless due to several effects:

*Effects depending on relative position in the spacecraft:
**Because the force of gravity decreases with distance, objects with non-zero size will be subjected to a [[tidal force]], or a differential pull, between the ends of the object nearest and furthest from the Earth. (An extreme version of this effect is [[spaghettification]].) In a spacecraft in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), the [[centrifugal force]] is also greater on the side of the spacecraft furthest from the Earth. At a 400&amp;nbsp;km LEO altitude, the overall differential in g-force is approximately 0.384 μ''g''/m. &lt;ref = name=conceptual&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tqpqB5LPxygC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;ots=pFOiNIwm6m&amp;dq=microgravity%20tidal%20equations&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=microgravity%20tidal%20equations&amp;f=true Conceptual Design and Flight Simulation of Space Stations
By Reinhold Bertrand&lt;/ref&gt;
** "Floating" objects in a spacecraft in LEO are actually in independent orbits around the Earth.  If two objects are placed side-by-side (relative to their direction of motion), they will be orbiting the Earth in different orbital planes.  Since all orbital planes pass through the center of the earth, any two orbital planes intersect along a line.  Therefore, two objects placed side-by-side (at any distance apart) will come together after one quarter of a revolution.  If they are placed so they miss each other, they will oscillate past each other, with the same period as the orbit. This corresponds to an inward acceleration of 0.128 μ''g'' per meter horizontal distance from the center at 400&amp;nbsp;km altitude.&lt;ref = name=conceptual/&gt; If they are placed one ahead of the other in the same orbital plane, they will maintain their separation.  If they are placed one above the other (at different radii from the center of the Earth), they will have different potential energies, so the size, eccentricity, and period of their orbits will be different, causing them to move in a complex looping pattern relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chandler, David|title=Weightlessness and Microgravity|journal=The Physics Teacher|date= May 1991|pages=312–13|url=http://www.lcurve.org/writings/PT-WeightlessnessAndMicrogravity.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.2343327|bibcode=1991PhTea..29..312C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Gravity between the spacecraft and an object within it may make the object slowly "fall" toward a more massive part of it. The acceleration is 0.007 μ''g'' for 1000&amp;nbsp;kg at 1&amp;nbsp;m distance.
*Uniform effects (which could be compensated):
**Though very thin, there is some air at orbital altitudes of 185 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;km. This atmosphere causes deceleration due to friction. This could be compensated by a small continuous thrust, but in practice the deceleration is only compensated from time to time, so the small g-force of this effect is not eliminated.
**The effects of the [[solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]] are similar, but directed away from the Sun. Unlike the effect of the atmosphere, it does not reduce with altitude.

==Commercial applications==

===Metal spheres===
In a [[shot tower]] (now obsolete), molten metal (such as [[lead]] or [[steel]]) was dripped through a sieve into free fall. With sufficient height (several hundred feet), the metal would be solid enough to resist impact (usually in a water bath) at the bottom of the tower. While the shot may have been slightly deformed by its passage through the air and by impact at the bottom, this method produced metal spheres of sufficient roundness to be used directly in [[shotgun]] shells or to be refined by further processing for applications requiring higher accuracy.

===High-quality crystals===
While not yet a commercial application, there has been interest in growing [[crystal]]s in micro-g, as in a [[space station]] or automated artificial [[satellite]], in an attempt to reduce crystal lattice defects.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.discovery.com/space/growing-crystals-in-zero-gravity-121227.htm Growing Crystals in Zero-Gravity]" News Article by [[Discovery Channel|Discovery]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such defect-free crystals may prove useful for certain microelectronic applications and also to produce crystals for subsequent [[X-ray crystallography]].

It is one of the most studied physiological problems of spaceflight but continues to pose a significant difficulty for many astronauts.  In some instances, it can be so debilitating that astronauts must sit out from their scheduled occupational duties in space – including missing out on a spacewalk they have spent months training to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4270801&amp;page=1|title=Illness keeps astronaut from spacewalk|last=|first=|date=February 12, 2008|website=ABCNews|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, however, astronauts will work through the symptoms even with degradation in their performance.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4|title=The Human Body and Weightlessness {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Thornton|first=William|last2=Bonato|first2=Frederick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=32|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their experiences in some of the most rigorous and demanding physical maneuvers on earth, even the most seasoned astronauts may be affected by SMS, resulting in symptoms of severe [[nausea]], projectile [[vomiting]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], malaise (feeling sick), and [[headache]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These symptoms may occur so abruptly and without any warning that space travelers may vomit suddenly without time to contain the emesis, resulting in strong odors and liquid within the cabin which may affect other astronauts.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Symptoms typically last anywhere from one to three days upon entering weightlessness, but may recur upon reentry to Earth’s gravity or even shortly after landing.  SMS differs from terrestrial motion sickness in that sweating and pallor are typically minimal or absent and gastrointestinal findings usually demonstrate absent bowel sounds indicating reduced [[gastrointestinal motility]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Space Pharmacology|last=Wotring|first=V. E.|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4614-3396-5|location=Boston|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the nausea and vomiting resolve, some central nervous system symptoms may persist which may degrade the astronaut’s performance.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Graybiel and Knepton proposed the term “[[sopite syndrome]]” to describe symptoms of lethargy and drowsiness associated with motion sickness in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graybiel|first=A.|last2=Knepton|first2=J.|date=August 1976|title=Sopite syndrome: a sometimes sole manifestation of motion sickness|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=47|issue=8|pages=873–882|issn=0095-6562|pmid=949309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, their definition has been revised to include “…a symptom complex that develops as a result of exposure to real or apparent motion and is characterized by excessive drowsiness, lassitude, lethargy, mild depression, and reduced ability to focus on an assigned task.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262582074_Sopite_Syndrome_A_Revised_Definition|title=Sopite Syndrome: A Revised Definition (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these symptoms may pose a substantial threat (albeit temporary) to the astronaut who must remain attentive to life and death issues at all times.

SMS is most commonly thought to be a disorder of the vestibular system that occurs when sensory information from the visual system (sight) and the proprioceptive system (posture, position of the body) conflicts with misperceived information from the semicircular canals and the otoliths within the inner ear.  This is known as the ‘neural mismatch theory’ and was first suggested in 1975 by Reason and Brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2073893|title=Motion sickness|last=T.|first=Reason, J.|date=1975|publisher=Academic Press|others=Brand, J. J.,|isbn=0125840500|location=London|oclc=2073893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the fluid shift hypothesis suggests that weightlessness reduces the hydrostatic pressure on the lower body causing fluids to shift toward the head from the rest of the body. These fluid shifts are thought to increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure (causing back aches), intracranial pressure (causing headaches), and inner ear fluid pressure (causing vestibular dysfunction).&lt;ref name="Heer 77–79"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heer|first=Martina|last2=Paloski|first2=William H.|title=Space motion sickness: Incidence, etiology, and countermeasures|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1566070206002141|journal=Autonomic Neuroscience|volume=129|issue=1–2|pages=77–79|doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2006.07.014|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a multitude of studies searching for a solution to the problem of SMS, it remains an ongoing problem for space travel.  Most non-pharmacological countermeasures such as training and other physical maneuvers have offered minimal benefit.  Thornton and Bonato noted, “Pre- and inflight adaptive efforts, some of them mandatory and most of them onerous, have been, for the most part, operational failures.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4|title=The Human Body and Weightlessness {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Thornton|first=William|last2=Bonato|first2=Frederick|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-32829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the most common intervention is [[promethazine]], an injectable antihistamine with antiemetic properties, but sedation can be a problematic side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461433958|title=Space Pharmacology {{!}} Virginia E. Wotring {{!}} Springer|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common pharmacological options include [[Metoclopramide|metaclopromide]], as well as oral and transdermal application of [[scopolamine]], but drowsiness and sedation are common side effects for these medications as well.&lt;ref name="Heer 77–79"/&gt;

===Musculoskeletal effects===
In the space (or microgravity) environment the effects of unloading varies significantly among individuals, with sex differences compounding the variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ploutz-Snyder|first=Lori|last2=Bloomfield|first2=Susan|last3=Smith|first3=Scott M.|last4=Hunter|first4=Sandra K.|last5=Templeton|first5=Kim|last6=Bemben|first6=Debra|date=2014-11-01|title=Effects of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space: Musculoskeletal Health|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jwh.2014.4910|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=23|issue=11|pages=963–966|doi=10.1089/jwh.2014.4910|issn=1540-9996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in mission duration, and the small sample size of astronauts participating in the same mission also adds to the variability to the [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s that are seen in space.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narici|first=M.

D. de|date=2011-03-01|title=Disuse of the musculo-skeletal system in space and on earth|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-010-1556-x|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=111|issue=3|pages=403–420|doi=10.1007/s00421-010-1556-x|issn=1439-6319}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to muscle loss, microgravity leads to increased [[bone resorption]], decreased [[bone mineral density]], and increased fracture risks.  Bone resorption leads to increased urinary levels of [[Calcium in biology|calcium]], which can subsequently lead to an increased risk of [[nephrolithiasis]].&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Scott M.|last2=Heer|first2=Martina|last3=Shackelford|first3=Linda C.|last4=Sibonga|first4=Jean D.|last5=Spatz|first5=Jordan|last6=Pietrzyk|first6=Robert A.|last7=Hudson|first7=Edgar K.|last8=Zwart|first8=Sara R.|title=Bone metabolism and renal stone risk during International Space Station missions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S8756328215003658|journal=Bone|volume=81|pages=712–720|doi=10.1016/j.bone.2015.10.002|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first two weeks that the muscles are unloaded from carrying the weight of the human frame during space flight, whole muscle atrophy begins. Postural muscles contain more slow fibers, and are more prone to atrophy than non-postural muscle groups.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The loss of muscle mass occurs because of imbalances in protein synthesis and breakdown.  The loss of muscle mass is also accompanied by a loss of muscle strength, which was observed after only 2–5 days of spaceflight during the [[Soyuz 3|Soyuz-3]] and [[Soyuz 8|Soyuz-8]] missions.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Decreases in the generation of contractile forces and whole muscle power have also been found in response to microgravity.

To counter the effects of microgravity on the musculoskeletal system, aerobic exercise is recommended. This often takes the form of in-flight cycling.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; A more effective regimen includes resistive exercises or the use of a penguin suit&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; (contains sewn-in elastic bands to maintain a stretch load on antigravity muscles), centrifugation, and vibration.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Centrifugation recreates Earth’s gravitational force on the space station, in order to prevent [[muscle atrophy]].  Centrifugation can be performed with centrifuges or by cycling along the inner wall of the space station.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Whole body vibration has been found to reduce bone resorption through mechanisms that are unclear.  Vibration can be delivered using exercise devices that use vertical displacements juxtaposed to a fulcrum, or by using a plate that oscillates on a vertical axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elmantaser|first=M.|last2=McMillan|first2=M.|last3=Smith|first3=K.|last4=Khanna|first4=S.|last5=Chantler|first5=D.|last6=Panarelli|first6=M.|last7=Ahmed|first7=S.

Microgravity can also lead to height increases; in 2018 a Japanese astronout reported growing 2 centimetres in just three weeks of micro-gravity on board the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/japanese-astronaut-concerned-after-growing-3-5-inches-t-1821910135 |title=Japanese Astronaut Concerned After Growing 3.5 Inches Taller in Three Weeks - Update: He Was Wrong |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiovascular effects ===
[[File:StationLIFE - Cardiovascular (January 2016).webm|thumb|569x569px|Astronaut Tracy Dyson talks about studies into cardiovascular health aboard the International Space Station.]]
Next to the skeletal and muscular system, the cardiovascular system is less strained in weightlessness than on Earth and is de-conditioned during longer periods spent in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471263869.sst074/abstract|title=Encyclopedia of Space Science and Technology|last=Ramsdell|first=Craig D.|last2=Cohen|first2=Richard J.|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780471263869|language=en|doi=10.1002/0471263869.sst074}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a regular environment, gravity exerts a downward force, setting up a vertical hydrostatic gradient. When standing, some 'excess' fluid resides in vessels and tissues of the legs. In a micro-g environment, with the loss of a [[Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic gradient]], some fluid quickly redistributes toward the chest and upper body; sensed as 'overload' of circulating blood volume.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23924131_Current_status_and_future_direction_of_NASA's_Space_Life_Sciences_Program|title=Current status and future direction of NASA's Space Life Sciences Program (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the micro-g environment, the newly sensed excess blood volume is adjusted by expelling excess fluid into tissues and cells (12-15% volume reduction) and [[red blood cell]]s are adjusted downward to maintain a normal concentration (relative [[anemia]]).&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In the absence of gravity, venous blood will rush to the [[Atrium (heart)|right atrium]] because the force of gravity is no longer pulling the blood down into the vessels of the legs and abdomen, resulting in increased [[stroke volume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin119/bul119_chap4.pdf|title=What Happens to the Human Heart in Space - Parabolic Flights Provide Some Answers|last=Aubert|first=Andre|date=August 2004|website=ESA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fluid shifts become more dangerous upon returning to a regular gravity environment as the body will attempt to adapt to the reintroduction of gravity. The reintroduction of gravity again will pull the fluid downward, but now there would be a deficit in both circulating fluid and red blood cells. The decrease in cardiac filling pressure and stroke volume during the orthostatic stress due to a decreased blood volume is what causes [[orthostatic intolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wieling|first=Wouter|last2=Halliwill|first2=John R|last3=Karemaker|first3=John M|date=2002-01-01|title=Orthostatic intolerance after space flight|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=538|issue=Pt 1|pages=1|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013372|issn=0022-3751|pmc=2290012|pmid=11773310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthostatic intolerance can result in temporary loss of consciousness and posture, due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Julian M.|date=2013-05-01|title=Common Syndromes of Orthostatic Intolerance|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/5/968|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=131|issue=5|pages=968–980|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-2610|issn=0031-4005|pmid=23569093|pmc=3639459}}&lt;/ref&gt; More chronic orthostatic intolerance can result in additional symptoms such as [[nausea]], [[Sleep disorder|sleep problems]], and other vasomotor symptoms as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Julian M.|title=Chronic orthostatic intolerance and the postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002234760400650X|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|volume=145|issue=6|pages=725–730|doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2004.06.084|year=2004|pmc=4511479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies on the physiological effects of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system are done in parabolic flights. It is one of the only feasible options to combine with human experiments, making parabolic flights the only way to investigate the true effects of the micro-g environment on a body without traveling into space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953694996|title=Cardiovascular system, red blood cells, and oxygen transport in microgravity|others=Gunga, Hanns-Christian,, Ahlefeld, Victoria Weller von,, Coriolano, Hans-Joachim Appell,, Werner, Andreas,, Hoffmann, Uwe,|isbn=9783319332260|location=Switzerland|oclc=953694996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parabolic flight studies have provided a broad range of results regarding changes in the cardiovascular system in a micro-g environment. Parabolic flight studies have increased the understanding of orthostatic intolerance and decreased peripheral blood flow suffered by Astronauts returning to Earth. Due to the loss of blood to pump, the heart can atrophy in a micro-g environment. A weakened heart can result in low blood volume, low blood pressure and affect the body's ability to send oxygen to the brain without the individual becoming dizzy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/652.html|title=Cardiac Atrophy and Diastolic Dysfunction During and After Long Duration Spaceflight: Functional Consequences for Orthostatic Intolerance, Exercise Capability and Risk for Cardiac Arrhythmias (Integrated Cardiovascular)|last=Bungo|first=Michael|date=March 23, 2016|website=NASA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heart arrhythmia|Heart rhythm disturbances]] have also been seen among astronauts, but it is not clear whether this was due to pre-existing conditions of effects of a micro-g environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritsch-Yelle|first=Janice M.|last2=Leuenberger|first2=Urs A.|last3=D’Aunno|first3=Dominick S.|last4=Rossum|first4=Alfred C.|last5=Brown|first5=Troy E.|last6=Wood|first6=Margie L.|last7=Josephson|first7=Mark E.|last8=Goldberger|first8=Ary L.|title=An Episode of Ventricular Tachycardia During Long-Duration Spaceflight|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0002-9149(98)00179-9|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|volume=81|issue=11|pages=1391–1392|doi=10.1016/s0002-9149(98)00179-9|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; One current countermeasure includes drinking a salt solution, which increases the viscosity of blood and would subsequently increase blood pressure which would mitigate post micro-g environment orthostatic intolerance.

== Impacts to worker safety ==
Space Motion Sickness can lead to degraded astronaut performance.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; SMS threatens operational requirements, reduces situational awareness, and threatens the safety of those exposed to micro-g environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006502642|title=The human body and weightlessness : operational effects, problems and countermeasures|last=William,|first=Thornton,|others=Bonato, Frederick,|isbn=9783319328294|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=1006502642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lost muscle mass leads to difficulty with movement, especially when astronauts return to earth.  This can pose a safety issue if the need for emergency egress were to arise. Loss of muscle power makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for astronauts to climb through emergency egress hatches or create unconventional exit spaces in the case of a crash upon landing.  Additionally, bone resorption and inadequate hydration in space can lead to the formation of kidney stones, and subsequent sudden incapacitation due to pain.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;  If this were to occur during critical phases of flight, a capsule crash leading to worker injury and/or death could result. Short-term and long-term health effects have been seen in the cardiovascular system from exposure to the micro-g environment that would limit those exposed after they return to Earth or a regular gravity environment. Steps need to be taken to ensure proper precautions are taken into consideration when dealing a micro-g environment for worker safety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Orthostatic intolerance can lead to temporary loss of consciousness due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume. This loss of consciousness inhibits and endangers those affected and can lead to deadly consequences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Psychological impact==
{{See also|Miscarriage and mental illness}}
Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a " ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies..."&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt; Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="loyd"/&gt; The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brier|first=Norman|date=2008-03-17|title=Grief Following Miscarriage: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=17|issue=3|pages=451–464|doi=10.1089/jwh.2007.0505|pmid=18345996|issn=1540-9996|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disbelief, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anger]], and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=Cara Bicking|last2=Baptiste-Roberts|first2=Kesha|last3=Zhu|first3=Junjia|last4=Kjerulff|first4=Kristen H.|date=2015-02-01|title=Effect of Previous Miscarriage on Depressive Symptoms During Subsequent Pregnancy and Postpartum in the First Baby Study|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=391–400|doi=10.1007/s10995-014-1521-0|pmid=24894728|issn=1092-7875|pmc=4256135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = beutel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beutel|first=M.|last2=Deckardt|first2=R.|last3=von Rad|first3=M.|last4=Weiner|first4=H.|date=November 1995|title=Grief and depression after miscarriage: their separation, antecedents, and course|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=57|issue=6|pages=517–526|issn=0033-3174|pmid=8600477}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief.&lt;ref name="kirs" /&gt;

Grieving can create feelings of [[loneliness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
This grieving has been called a type of  [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="loyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd Jones|first1=Sarah|year=2015|title=The Psychological Miscarriage: An Exploration of Women's Experience of Miscarriage in the Light of Winnicott's 'Primary Maternal Preoccupation', The Process of Grief According to Bowlby and Parkes, and Klein's Theory of Mourning|journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=31|issue=4|pages=433–447|doi=10.1111/bjp.12172|issn=0265-9883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Other serious consequences can develop including depression, [[anxiety disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]]. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others.

Unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women.&lt;ref name="Robinson2011dil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gail Erlick|title=Dilemmas Related to Pregnancy Loss|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=199|issue=8|year=2011|pages=571–574|issn=0022-3018|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318225f31e|pmid=21814082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidt|first=CE|date=2007|title=Trauerverarbeitung nach Prä- und Perinatalverlust ( Mourning processing after pre-and perinatal loss)|journal=Psychother Psych Med|volume=57|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1055/s-2006-951906|pmid=17357028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even depression can occur.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;

===Trauma===
Miscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt; Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated.{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}}&lt;ref name=buon/&gt; The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
The trauma of miscarriage can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
&lt;!--==Risks==--&gt; 
Bipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bilpolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;

==== Mental health ====
Women experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;  Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}}  Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develop a close bond "with her baby" experiences the loss of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Complicated grief===
Different grieving "styles" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an "obsessive" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to "reminisce about the loss of a loved one".{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}} [[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress and posttraumatic stress disorder===
Miscarriage is associated with post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=daug&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daugirdaitė|first=Viltė|last2=Akker|first2=Olga van den|last3=Purewal|first3=Satvinder|date=2015|title=Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Termination of Pregnancy and Reproductive Loss: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2015/646345/|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|language=en|volume=2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933|issn=2090-2727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Stephen V.|last2=James|first2=Larry C.|last3=Solursh|first3=Diane S.|last4=Yancey|first4=Michael K.|last5=Epperly|first5=Ted D.|last6=Folen|first6=Raymond A.|last7=Masone|first7=Maryann|date=2000-03-15|title=Acute and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder After Spontaneous Abortion|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1689.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=61|issue=6|issn=0002-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of  social support.&lt;ref name= daug/&gt; Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues.&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk.{{sfn|Christiansen|page = 92}}

==Recovery==
Physical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances f[[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] is present. [[Insomnia]] can be a problem.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aafp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it. Others may blame the father or partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=B.|date=2007-01-01|title=Culpability and blame after pregnancy loss|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/33/1/24|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–27|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.015560|issn=0306-6800|pmid=17209106|pmc=2598085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping with a miscarriage can very greatly between women and families.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Some find it difficult to talk about the miscarriage.&lt;ref name = aafp&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-11-01|title=Pregnancy Loss: What You Should Know|journal=American Family Physician|volume = 76|issue=9|pages=1347–8|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1347.html|language=en|pmid=18019879|author1=American Academy of Family Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects.&lt;ref name = loyd/&gt; Some women engage in activities that are believed to aid in recovery such as therapy, [[religion]] and art.{{sfn|Seftel|page = 57}}
&lt;!--Interventions==--&gt;Counseling can be offered but effective interventions to assist in recovery have been difficult to identify due to the reports of efficacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neugebauer|first=Richard|last2=Kline|first2=Jennie|last3=Bleiberg|first3=Kathryn|last4=Baxi|first4=Laxmi|last5=Markowitz|first5=John C.|last6=Rosing|first6=Mark|last7=Levin|first7=Bruce|last8=Keith|first8=Jessica|date=2007|title=Preliminary open trial of interpersonal counseling for subsyndromal depression following miscarriage|journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume=24|issue=3|pages=219–222|doi=10.1002/da.20150|issn=1091-4269|pmid=16988939}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ineffective counseling. Comparisons are hard to make.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Despite the lack of studies that describe effective interventions for those with grief after a miscarriage, some clinicians still offer counselling and follow-up to help women recover and adapt to the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Rachel|date=Jun 20–26, 2012|title=Emotional care for women who experience miscarriage|journal=Nursing Standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain): 1987)|volume=26|issue=42|pages=35–41|doi=10.7748/ns2012.06.26.42.35.c9160|issn=0029-6570|pmid=22908762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendations to help recover from the event include:
* Turning to loved ones and friends for support. Sharing feelings and asking for help when needed.
* Talking to the partner about the miscarriage. 
* Keeping in mind that men and women cope with loss in different ways.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Making good choices for health and well-being such as: eating healthy foods, keeping active, and getting enough sleep to help restore energy.
* Joining a support group. A support group might help with feelings of being alone in the loss.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Doing something in remembrance of the baby.
* Seeking help from a grief counselor, especially if the grief doesn't ease with time.&lt;ref name = whealth/&gt;

Generally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}} Other methods used to promote recovery are be relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and "thought-stopping". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can "emotionally relocate the child", redefine a relationship "with the missing child", and engage in "continuing the bond" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 60}}

Women who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014provision/&gt; One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother "...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response..."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Dorte M.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735816300903|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|language=en|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can "expect parents to move on with their lives."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Children and concerns about future pregnancies==
One emotional response to miscarriage is the strong apprehension that can develop anticipating a subsequent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = sing&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Singapore Nursing Journal | title = The impact miscarriage on women's psychological well being and interventions: A literature review | first = Marianne | last = Wen-Yi | first2 = Lam | last2 = Ka Shun | first3 = Priscilla Jia | last3 = Ling Ho et.al }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Procreation abilities may also be questioned by the woman.&lt;ref name = sing/&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Significant distress can develop in the other children in the family when they think a sibling has died. They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings. Children can also need help, understanding and the ability to make sense of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Becoming Parents and Overcoming Obstacles : Understanding the Experience of Miscarriage, Premature Births, Infertility, and Postnatal Depression|last=Quagliata|first=Emanuela|publisher=Karnac Books|year=2013|isbn=9781782200185|location=City|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials and burial==
[[Ritual]]s that recognize the loss can be important in coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's reproductive mental health across the lifespan|others=Lynn-Barnes, Diana|isbn=9783319051154|location=Cham|oclc=880941778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event.

&lt;!--==Narratives==
Women discuss their miscarriage and interact with others who have had the same experience. This is one way that their loss is recognized, publically mourned and socially accepted.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 57}}--&gt;

==In culture==
Grieving after the loss of a child through miscarriage in other cultures can vary from western culture.&lt;ref name="Klass2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klass|first1=Dennis|title=Book Reviews of Narratives of Sorrow and Dignity: Japanese Women, Pregnancy Loss, and Modern Rituals of Grieving|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=70|issue=4|year=2015|pages=454–457|issn=0030-2228|doi=10.1177/0030222815573931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hospicefoundation.org/Grief-(1)/What-to-Expect | title=Hospice Foundation of America - What is Grief?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual’s [[culture]] plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is appropriate to take into account cultural norms before reaching a complicated grief diagnosis.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shear|first1=MK|last2=Simon|first2=N|last3=Wall|first3=M|last4=Zisook|first4=S|last5=Neimeyer|first5=R|last6=Duan|first6=N|last7=Reynolds|first7=C|last8=Lebowitz|first8=B|last9=Sung|first9=S|last10=Ghesquiere|first10=A|last11=Gorscak|first11=B|last12=Clayton|first12=P|last13=Ito|first13=M|last14=Nakajima|first14=S|last15=Konishi|first15=T|last16=Melhem|first16=N|last17=Meert|first17=K|last18=Schiff|first18=M|last19=O'Connor|first19=MF|last20=First|first20=M|last21=Sareen|first21=J|last22=Bolton|first22=J|last23=Skritskaya|first23=N|last24=Mancini|first24=AD|last25=Keshaviah|first25=A|title=Complicated grief and related bereavement issues for DSM-5.|journal=Depression and Anxiety|date=February 2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=103–17|doi=10.1002/da.20780|pmid=21284063|pmc=3075805}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultural differences in emotional levels, how these are expressed and how long they are expressed.

Recurring miscarriage may increase the incidence of intrusive thoughts in women and their partners.&lt;ref name="daug" /&gt;

Women who have had clinical depression before the miscarriage are more likely to develop PTSD.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;  [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] is associated with miscarriage along with other traumatic events associated with pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christiansen|first1=DM|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=February 2017|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Martin|page = 26 }}&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|url=|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daugirdaitė|first1=V|last2=van den Akker|first2=O|last3=Purewal|first3=S|title=Posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic stress disorder after termination of pregnancy and reproductive loss: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|date=2015|volume=2015|pages=1-14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those who experience recurrent miscarriage (&gt;3) have a greater risk of developing PTSD than those who have experienced miscarriage once.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt; An association between the gender of the infant lost through miscarriage exists whereby there is an increased chance of developing PTSD if the infant was a male. Knowing the cause of the miscarriage does not reduce the risk of developing PTSD. Finding a 'meaning' for the loss reduces the risk of developing PTSD. A negative outlook regarding the world in general is corrlated with increased levels of PTSD. Poor self-esteem is also related to developing PTSD after the loss. If memories of the loss are considered intense, risk for PTSD is increased. There are concerns that PTSD in mothers may have a negative impact on children born after the event.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

Though the development of PTSD in women and families after the loss has been identified, the presence of PTSD in a woman who is pregnant is detrimental. Women with PTSD are thought to be at a higher risk of prenatal loss, perinatal loss, pregnancy complications, ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth and growth abnormalities in the fetus.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

PTSD in a mother is suspected to increase the risk of autism, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes in a child.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

==Depression and anxiety==
43% of women who miscarry are found to have depression, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name = rand/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880941778|title=Women's reproductive mental health across the lifespan|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Lynn-Barnes, Diana,|isbn=9783319051161|location=Cham|pages=|oclc=880941778 |postscript =  (online text, no page numbers)|last1=Barnes|first1=Diana Lynn|date=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--and [[bipolar disorder]].{{mcn|date=October 2017}} [[ Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R)]] has been used to quantify the severity of a miscarriage and 47.5% of the women experiencing a miscarriage have high scores.

[[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] is an [[Atypical depression|atypical]] response to a miscarriage. It differs from the more common form of [[Miscarriage and grief|grief]] that occurs after a miscarriage. The [[Kübler-Ross model|grieving process]] associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in a predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most (59%) do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/06/miscarriage.aspx|title=Miscarriage and loss|publisher = American Psychological Association  | date = 2017 |language=en|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive Behavior Therapy]] has been found to be helpful if it is begun immediately after the loss.&lt;ref name=Christiansen2017/&gt;

== Epidemeology ==
A woman who miscarries has a 2.5 times greater risk for depression than those who have not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the US, estimates of PTSD related to miscarriage are thought to be 150,000–200,000 acute and 24,000–32,000 chronic PTSD cases.

[[File:TripletBoys.JPG|thumb|300px|Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.]]
A '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[placental]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.

Each fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).

A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''.

Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

[[File:Being a twin means you always have a pillow or blanket handy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.]]
Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:
*two offspring – twins
*three offspring – triplets
*four offspring – quadruplets
*five offspring – quintuplets
*six offspring – sextuplets
*seven offspring – septuplets
*eight offspring – octuplets
*nine offspring – nonuplets
*ten offspring – decuplets

Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:
*Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single [[zygote]]
*Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes:
:*Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes
:*Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes

Multiple pregnancies are also classified by how the fetuses are surrounded by one or more [[placenta]]s and [[amniotic sac]]s; the placentas are referenced as "chorions":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary: Multiple pregnancy: antenatal care for twin and triplet pregnancies |url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg129/chapter/appendix-e-definitions-of-key-terms |publisher=NICE |date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monochorionic fetuses share one placenta; dichorionic twins, trichorionic triplets, etc. each has a separate placenta.
* Monoamniotic fetuses share one amniotic sac; diamniotic twins each have their own sac, as do triamniotic triplets, etc. 
* There are many combinations possible -- for example with dichorionic triamniotic triplets, one fetus has a separate placenta and two of the fetuses share a placenta, and each has its own amniotic sac.

==Human multiple births==
In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than [[gestation]]) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.

Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulkarni AD, Jamieson DJ, Jones HW, Kissin DM, Gallo MF, Macaluso M, Adashi EY | title = Fertility Treatments and Multiple Births in the United States | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2218–2225 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24304051 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1301467 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twins===
{{Main|Twin}}

Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt;

===Triplets===
[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]
[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.

Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt; According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt; Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt; According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence".&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015" /&gt;

Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun2015"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-identical-triplets-20151023-story.html|title = Rare identical triplets born to Baltimore couple|last = Cohn|first = Meredith|date = October 23, 2015|work = [[Baltimore Sun|Baltim.

===Quadruplets===
Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the [[Genain quadruplets]], all of whom developed [[schizophrenia]].
Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|quad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- COMMENTING OUT CONFLICTING STATS - CHECK SOURCES Two genetically-different sets of identical twins statistically make up half of all quadruplets. Approximately 95% of quadruplets are all fraternal. --&gt;

===Quintuplets===
[[File:Dionnequints2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Dionne quintuplets|Dionne sisters]], seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.]]
Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.baby2see.com/multiples/multiples.html |title = Multiples in pregnancy - twins triplets quads identical and fraternal |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204054229/http://www.baby2see.com/multiples/multiples.html |archivedate=2015-02-04 |website = Baby2see.com|date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian [[Dionne Quintuplets]], born in 1934.

===Sextuplets===
Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the [[Walton sextuplets]] were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/215904/2004/05/10/day-after-mothers-day-gosselin-sextuplets-arrive |title=The day after Mother's Day, the Gosselin sextuplets arrive |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023233314/http://news.psu.edu/story/215904/2004/05/10/day-after-mothers-day-gosselin-sextuplets-arrive |archivedate=2016-10-23 |df=|date = 10 May 2004|publisher = Penn State University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reality television shows called Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 and later [[Kate Plus 8]] have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.

===Very high-order multiple births===
In 1997, the [[McCaughey septuplets]] were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the [[Chukwu octuplets|Chukwu family]] in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the [[Suleman octuplets]], were born in [[Bellflower, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7852623.stm |title= US woman gives birth to octuplets|deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127213838/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7852623.stm |archivedate=27 January 2009|date = 27 January 2009|work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/01/a-mother-has-gi.html |title = Octuplets born in Bellflower|deadurl= no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220201234/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/01/a-mother-has-gi.html |archivedate=2014-12-20|date = 26 January 2009|work = [[LA Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, all were still alive shortly before their fifth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/24/8-facts-octomom/4816235/|title= 8 facts about 'Octomom' Nadya Suleman|deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128191349/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/24/8-facts-octomom/4816235/ |archivedate=2017-01-28 |work = USA Today|date = 24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a few sets of nonuplets (9) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births.  The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from [[fertility medication]]s and [[assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technology (ART)]]. However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Causes and frequency==
{{globalize/North America|date=December 2010}}
The frequency of ''N'' multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89&lt;sup&gt;''N''-1&lt;/sup&gt; (''[[Hellin's law]]'') and as about 1:80&lt;sup&gt;''N''-1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=McGraw&gt;{{cite web| first1= Melissa|last1= Bush|first2= Martin L.|last2= Pernoll | title =Multiple Pregnancy | work =Pregnancy Health Center  | url=http://www.health.am/pregnancy/multiple-pregnancy/| date = 15 September 2010| publisher=Health.am | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives:
*1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins
*1:89&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (= 1:6400) for triplets
*1:89&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for quadruplets

North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/multiple.htm National Center for Health Statistics - Multiple Births] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020102618/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/multiple.htm |date=2013-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf#table01 National Vital Statistics Reports, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,  Volume 61, Number 1, August 28, 2012, Births: Final Data for 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720102442/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf |date=July 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Twins, 132,562, 3.31%
* Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%
* Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%
* Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%

Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of [[infertility]] treatments such as [[In vitro fertilization|IVF]] (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).

For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation.&lt;ref name="pmid16497698"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beemsterboer SN, Homburg R, Gorter NA, Schats R, Hompes PG, Lambalk CB | title = The paradox of declining fertility but increasing twinning rates with advancing maternal age | journal = Hum. Reprod. | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 1531–2 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16497698 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/del009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as [[in-vitro fertilization]]. Younger patients who undergo treatment with [[fertility medication]] containing artificial [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]], followed by intrauterine [[insemination]], are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.

[[File:KoreAm 2008-05 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of ''[[KoreAm]]'', May 2008]]
Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:
*mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Multiple Pregnancy - ACOG|url = http://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Multiple-Pregnancy#are|website = www.acog.org|access-date = 2016-01-13|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160111114120/http://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Multiple-Pregnancy#are|archivedate = 2016-01-11|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*mother's use of [[fertility drug]]s: approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child

The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally ''Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8'' and (following their divorce) ''[[Kate Plus 8]]'', which became the highest-rated show on the ''[[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]'' network.

==Risks==

===Premature birth and low birth weight===
Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in [[premature birth]] than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons.&lt;ref name="AlexanderKoganMartinPapiernik"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexander GR, Kogan M, Martin J, Papiernik E | title = What are the fetal growth patterns of singletons, twins, and triplets in the United States? | journal = Clin Obstet Gynecol | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 114–25 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9504230 }} ''Note: This study was done by looking at the 1991–1995 U.S. Natality Files, which were received from the National Center for Health Statistics''&lt;/ref&gt; 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born ''very preterm'', compared to 1.7% in singletons.&lt;ref name="AlexanderKoganMartinPapiernik"/&gt;

At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamasmit|first1=W|last2=Chaithongwongwatthana|first2=S|last3=Tolosa|first3=JE|last4=Limpongsanurak|first4=S|last5=Pereira|first5=L|last6=Lumbiganon|first6=P|title=Prophylactic oral betamimetics for reducing preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 December 2015|volume=12|issue=12|pages=CD004733|pmid=26645888|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004733.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neilson|first1=JP|last2=West|first2=HM|last3=Dowswell|first3=T|title=Betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=5 February 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=CD004352|pmid=24500892|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004352.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a [[Cervical cerclage|cervical suture]]) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rafael|first1=TJ|last2=Berghella|first2=V|last3=Alfirevic|first3=Z|title=Cervical stitch (cerclage) for preventing preterm birth in multiple pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=10 September 2014|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD009166|pmid=25208049|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009166.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[preterm birth]]s also result in multiples tending to have a [[lower birth weight]] compared to singletons.

Some evidence{{Who|date=July 2009}} indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight.  This study{{Who|date=July 2009}} was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).

Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17&amp;nbsp;lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Le|first=Julia|title=Scale-tipping triplets set world record|url=http://www.mississauga.com/community/community/article/1048642|accessdate=26 July 2011|newspaper=Mississauga News|date=26 July 2011|location=Mississauga ON|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121153800/http://www.mississauga.com/community/community/article/1048642|archivedate=21 November 2011|df=}}; note that the record wasn't confirmed until July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cerebral palsy===
[[Cerebral palsy]] is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in [[North West England]].&lt;ref name="pmid8976682"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pharoah PO, Cooke T | title = Cerebral palsy and multiple births | journal = Arch. Dis. Child. Fetal Neonatal Ed. | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = F174–7 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8976682 | pmc = 1061194 | doi = 10.1136/fn.75.3.f174| quote = Note: They conducted a study by looking at the registered births of babies born with cerebral palsy during the periods of 1982-1989 in the counties of Merseyside and Cheshire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.

===Incomplete separation===
{{Further|Twin#Degree of separation}}
Multiples may be [[monochorionic]], sharing the same [[chorion]], with resultant risk of [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]]. Monochorionic multiples may even be [[monoamniotic]], sharing the same [[amniotic sac]], resulting in risk of [[umbilical cord compression]] and [[nuchal cord]]. In very rare cases, there may be [[conjoined twins]], possibly impairing function of internal organs.

===Mortality rate (stillbirth)===
Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate.  It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high.  A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets.  By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses.&lt;ref name="pmid9620827"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hammond KR | title = Multifetal pregnancy reduction | journal = J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 338–43 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9620827 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.1998.tb02657.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.

===Prevention in IVF===
Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 [[embryo transfer]]s performed as part of [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies.&lt;ref name=elsner1997&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsner CW, Tucker MJ, Sweitzer CL, Brockman WD, Morton PC, Wright G, Toledo AA | title = Multiple pregnancy rate and embryo number transferred during in vitro fertilization | journal = Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. | volume = 177 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–5; discussion 355–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9290450 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets).&lt;ref name=elsner1997/&gt; Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.

The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table:&lt;ref name=nice2013&gt;[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223023043/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG156 |date=2013-02-23 }}. [[NICE guidelines|NICE clinical guideline]] CG156 - Issued: February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

|rowspan=3| &lt;37 years || 1st || 1

Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available.&lt;ref name=nice2013/&gt;

==Management==
[[Bed rest]] has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCall|first1=CA|last2=Grimes|first2=DA|last3=Lyerly|first3=AD|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=June 2013|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1305–8|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/aog.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective reduction===
[[Selective reduction]] is the practice of reducing the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy; it is also called "multifetal reduction".&lt;ref name=ACOG2017&gt;{{cite web |title=Opinion Number 719: Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction |url=https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/Multifetal-Pregnancy-Reduction |publisher=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ Committee on Ethics. |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The procedure generally takes two days; the first day for testing in order to select which fetuses to kill, and the second day for the procedure itself, in which [[potassium chloride]] is injected into the heart of each selected fetus under the guidance of ultrasound imaging.&lt;ref name=Evans2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=MI |last2=Andriole |first2=S |last3=Britt |first3=DW |title=Fetal reduction: 25 years' experience. |journal=Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy |date=2014 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=69–82 |doi=10.1159/000357974 |pmid=24525884}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risks of the procedure include bleeding requiring transfusion, rupture of the uterus, [[retained placenta]], infection, a miscarriage, and [[prelabor rupture of membranes]]. Each of these appears to be rare.&lt;ref name=Legendre2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.02.004 |pmid=23518032 |title=Differences between selective termination of pregnancy and fetal reduction in multiple pregnancy: A narrative review |journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=542–54 |year=2013 |last1=Legendre |first1=Claire-Marie |last2=Moutel |first2=Grégoire |last3=Drouin |first3=Régen |last4=Favre |first4=Romain |last5=Bouffard |first5=Chantal }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective reduction was developed in the mid-1980s, as people in the field of assisted reproductive technology became aware of the risks that multiple pregnancies carried for the mother and for the fetuses.&lt;ref name=WaPO&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mundy |first1=Liza |title=Too Much to Carry? |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501730_pf.html |work=Washington Post Magazine |date=May 20, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405010648/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/15/AR2007051501730_pf.html |archivedate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=The Two-Minus-One Pregnancy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/magazine/the-two-minus-one-pregnancy.html|publisher=New York Times Magazine|first=Ruth|last=Padawer|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Care in pregnancy===
Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications.&lt;ref name =doddclinics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodd|first1=JM|last2=Dowswell|first2=T|last3=Crowther|first3=CA|title=Specialised antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy for improving maternal and infant outcomes.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=6 November 2015|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD005300|pmid=26545291|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005300.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care.&lt;ref name = doddclinics/&gt;

===Nutrition===
As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bricker|first1=L|last2=Reed|first2=K|last3=Wood|first3=L|last4=Neilson|first4=JP|title=Nutritional advice for improving outcomes in multiple pregnancies.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=24 November 2015|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD008867|pmid=26599328|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008867.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cesarean section or vaginal delivery===
A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a [[gestational age]] between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in [[cephalic presentation]], planned [[Cesarean section]] does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of [[Perinatal mortality|fetal or neonatal death]] or serious neonatal [[disability]], as compared with planned vaginal delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrett JF, Hannah ME, Hutton EK, Willan AR, Allen AC, Armson BA, Gafni A, Joseph KS, Mason D, Ohlsson A, Ross S, Sanchez JJ, Asztalos EV | title = A Randomized Trial of Planned Cesarean or Vaginal Delivery for Twin Pregnancy | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 14 | pages = 1295–1305 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24088091 | pmc =  3954096| doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1214939 | author14 = Twin Birth Study Collaborative Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as [[pregnancy complication]]s. In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee HC, Gould JB, Boscardin WJ, El-Sayed YY, Blumenfeld YJ | title = Trends in Cesarean Delivery for Twin Births in the United States | journal = Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 1095–101 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22015878 | pmc = 3202294 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182318651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15840743 Women can choose Caesarean birth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819201245/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15840743 |date=2012-08-19 }} - BBC article by James Gallagher. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Barrett|first2=JF|last3=Crowther|first3=CA|title=Planned caesarean section for women with a twin pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 December 2015|volume=12|issue=12|pages=CD006553|pmid=26684389|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006553.pub3|pmc=4110647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing.&lt;ref name = shub&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shub|first1=A|last2=Walker|first2=SP|title=Planned early delivery versus expectant management for monoamniotic twins.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=23 April 2015|volume=4|issue=4|pages=CD008820|pmid=25906204|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008820.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services.&lt;ref name = shub/&gt;

Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.

===Neonatal intensive care===
Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were.  Kaufman&lt;ref name="pmid9491857"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaufman GE, Malone FD, Harvey-Wilkes KB, Chelmow D, Penzias AS, D'Alton ME | title = Neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with triplet pregnancy | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9491857 | doi =  10.1016/s0029-7844(97)00686-8| url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered.  Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.

===Insurance coverage===
A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Moore JE, Witt WP, Elixhauser A | title = Complicating Conditions Associate With Childbirth, by Delivery Method and Payer, 2011. | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #173 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = April 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb173-Childbirth-Delivery-Complications.jsp | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142859/https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb173-Childbirth-Delivery-Complications.jsp | archivedate = 2014-07-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural aspects===
Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Korea's 'lucky' triplets seized|work=Herald Sun|publisher=Fairfax|date=2003-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maya civilization|Mayan]] culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ([[Romulus and Remus]]) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive [[dowry]] at about the same time.

[[File:Mother in bed, with seven children in a cradle (British Library Royal 15 E VI f 273r (detail).jpg|thumb|left|Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the [[Knight of the Swan]] romance ([[Talbot Shrewsbury Book]])]]

In Greek mythology, fraternal twins [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]], and [[Heracles|Heracles and Iphicles]], are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ([[Castor and Pollux|Polydeuces]], [[Heracles]]) is the illegitimate son of the god [[Zeus]]; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (of [[Trojan War#Elopement of Paris and Helen|Troy]]) and [[Clytemnestra]] (who are also sisters of [[Dioscuri|Castor and Polydeuces]]). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called ''[[superfecundation#Use in mythology|superfecundation]]''.

In certain medieval European [[chivalric romance]]s, such as [[Marie de France]]'s ''[[Le Fresne (lai)|Le Fresne]]'', a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p295, 244 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar effect occurs in the [[Knight of the Swan]] romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before [[Child abandonment#In fiction|exposing]] the children.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p239, 243 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39926">'''Nutrition transition''' is the shift in dietary [[food consumption|consumption]] and [[energy expenditure]] that coincides with economic, [[demographic change|demographic]], and [[epidemiological]] changes. Specifically the term is used for the transition of developing countries from traditional diets high in cereal and fiber to more [[Western pattern diet]]s high in [[sugar]]s, fat, and animal-source food.

==Historical framework==
The nutrition transition model was first proposed in 1993 by [[Barry Popkin]], and is the most cited framework in literature regarding the nutrition transition,&lt;ref name=Popkin1993&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 1993 | title = Nutritional Patterns and Transitions | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 138–157 | doi=10.2307/2938388}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been subject to some criticism for being overly simplified.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C | title = Uneven dietary development: linking the policies and processes of globalization with the nutrition transition, obesity and diet-related chronic diseases | journal = Globalization and Health | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 4 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16569239 | doi = 10.1186/1744-8603-2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lang2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lang T, Rayner G | title = Overcoming policy cacophony on obesity: an ecological public health framework for policymakers | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 165–81 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17316322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789x.2007.00338.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popkin posits that two other historic transitions affect and are affected by nutritional transition. The first is the [[demographic transition]], whereby a pattern of high fertility and high mortality transforms to one of low fertility and low mortality. Secondly, an [[epidemiological transition]] occurs, wherein a shift from a pattern of high prevalence of [[infectious disease]]s associated with [[malnutrition]], and with periodic famine and poor environmental sanitation, to a pattern of high prevalence of chronic and [[degenerative disease]]s associated with urban-industrial lifestyles is shown. These concurrent and dynamically influenced transitions share an emphasis on the ways in which populations move from one pattern to the next. 
Popkin used five broad patterns to help summarize the nutrition transition model.&lt;ref name=Popkin1993/&gt; While these patterns largely appear chronological, it is important to note that they are not restricted to certain periods of human history and still characterize certain geographic and socioeconomic subpopulations. The first pattern is that of collecting food, a characterization of hunter-gatherers, whose diets were high in carbohydrates and low in fat, especially saturated fat. The second pattern is defined by famine, a marked scarcity and reduced variation of the food supply. The third pattern is one of receding famine. Fruits, vegetables, and animal protein consumption increases, and starchy staples become less important in the diet. The fourth pattern is one of degenerative diseases onset by a diet high in total fat, cholesterol, sugar, and other refined carbohydrates and low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber. This pattern is often accompanied by an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. The fifth pattern, and most recently emerging pattern, is characterized by a behavioral change reflective of a desire to prevent or delay degenerative diseases. Recent and rapid changes seen in developing countries from the second and third pattern to the fourth is the common focus of nutrition transition research and desire for policy that would emphasize a healthier overall diet characterizes the shift from the fourth to the fifth pattern.

==Relation to economic development==
The nutrition transition has much of its roots in economic factors related to the development of a nation or subpopulations within a nation. It was once believed that current nutrition transition was endemic only to [[industrialized nations]] like the United States, but increasing research has indicated that not only is nutrition transition occurring most rapidly in low- and middle-income [[developing countries]], the stress of its effects stands to burden the poorest populations of these countries the most as well.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chopra M, Galbraith S, Darnton-Hill I | title = A global response to a global problem: the epidemic of overnutrition | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 80 | issue = 12 | pages = 952–8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12571723 | pmc = 2567699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2001b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 2001 | title = The Nutrition Transition and Obesity in the Developing World | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 871–873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 2003 | title = The Nutrition Transition in the Developing World | journal = Development Policy Review | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 581–597 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00225.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prentice2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prentice AM | title = The emerging epidemic of obesity in developing countries | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–9 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16326822 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyi272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmidhuber2005&gt;{{cite report | vauthors = Schmidhuber J, Shetty P | title = The Nutrition Transition to 2030: Why Developing Countries Are Likely to Bear the Major Burden. | work = 97th Seminar of the European Association of Agricultural Economists. | publisher = University of Reading | location = England | date = 21 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This shift is attributable to many causes. [[Globalization]] has played a large role in altering the access and availability of foods in formerly undeveloped nations. Demographic shifts from rural to urban areas are central to this as well as the liberalization of food markets, global food marketing, and the emergence of transnational food companies in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin1999&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | year = 1999 | title = Urbanization, Lifestyle Changes and the Nutrition Transition | journal = World Development | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1905–1916 | doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(99)00094-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007&gt;Hawkes C. "Globalization, Food, and Nutrition Transitions." Washington, DC: IFPRI, (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; All these forces of globalization are creating [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes that contribute to the nutrition transition. Technological advancements are making previously arduous labor less difficult and thus altering energy expenditure that would have helped offset the caloric increases in the diet.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001b/&gt; Daily tasks and leisure are also affected by technological advancements and contributing to greater rates of inactivity. The aforementioned increases in calorie are due to increased consumption of [[edible oils]], animal-source foods, caloric [[sweetener]]s, accompanied by reduced consumption of [[grain]]s and fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Nutrition in transition: the changing global nutrition challenge | journal = Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 10 | issue =  Supplement | pages = S13–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11708577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2002a&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = An overview on the nutrition transition and its health implications: the Bellagio meeting | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 1A | pages = 93–103 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 12027297 | doi = 10.1079/phn2001280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Does global obesity represent a global public health challenge? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 232–3 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21159790 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.110.008458 | pmc = 3021421 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes play into human biological preferences seen across the world.&lt;ref name=Drewnowski1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewnowski A, Popkin BM | title = The nutrition transition: new trends in the global diet | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 31–43 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9155216 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1997.tb01593.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic factors also play an important role as do cultural values tied to appearance and status.

===Globalization and economic factors ===
The current nutrition transition seen in the [[emerging market]]s of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa is largely a product of globalization. International [[food trade]], investment, [[commercialization]] and [[food marketing|marketing]] are drastically impacting the availability of and access to energy-dense, but nutrient-deficient foods causing the aforementioned shift from traditional diet.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt; Another byproduct of globalization has been a marked demographic transition in these countries from rural areas to urban ones. Urban populations are more susceptible to current trends in nutrition transition because of the improved transportation, commercial food distribution and marketing, less labor-intensive-occupations, and changes in household eating habits and structure.&lt;ref name=Popkin1993/&gt;
The [[liberalization]] of food markets has had a drastic effect on [[consumption pattern]]s across the globe. Liberalization and commercialization of domestic agricultural markets are opening up food trading since this is needed to compete in the world market.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C, Eckhardt C, Ruel M, Minot N | year = 2005 | title = Diet Quality, Poverty, and Food Policy: A New Research Agenda for Obesity Prevention in Developing Countries | url = https://www.unscn.org/web/archives_resources/files/scnnews29.pdf | journal = SCN News | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 20–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This had led to changes in the types of food produced, and increases in amounts of food imported into developing countries, which affects the relative availability and [[food prices|prices of different foods]]. 
Food demand is being shaped by increases in income and [[urbanization]]. As these rapidly developing nations continue to accrue high incomes per capita, their food spending is increasing as well. They elect to use these higher incomes on more calorically-dense foods that are sweeter and higher in fats.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt; For example, in China, for the same extra dollar of income, an average Chinese person is purchasing higher calorie food today than that person would have done for the same extra yuan in 1990.&lt;ref name=Shufa2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Du S, Mroz TA, Zhai F, Popkin BM | title = Rapid income growth adversely affects diet quality in China--particularly for the poor! | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 59 | issue = 7 | pages = 1505–15 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15246178 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.01.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid [[urbanization]] has also shaped food demand globally. The [[demographic transition]] from rural areas to urban populations is a well documented byproduct of globalization and technological advancements. This is because agro-food systems have replaced local subsistence farming in many rural areas.&lt;ref name=Brody2002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brody J | year = 2002 | title = The Global Epidemic of Childhood Obesity: Poverty, Urbanization, and Nutrition Transition | journal = Nutrition Bytes | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 1–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The supply of food is directly sculpted by increasing demand in these areas with growing income. Urbanization is increasing access to new foods and therefore altering the supply chain. This is why transnational food companies have grown so rapidly over the past few decades. These companies are making processed and fast foods much cheaper and more widely available through the growth of transnational supermarkets and chain restaurants. Food is not only easier to obtain in urban areas; it is also cheaper and less time-consuming to acquire which creates an imbalance between energy intake and output.&lt;ref name=Caba2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballero B | title = The global epidemic of obesity: an overview | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17569676 | doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their advertising and promotional strategies have a strong effect on consumer choices and desire. Foreign direct investment is also stimulating processed food sales in these supermarkets by lowering prices and creating incentives for advertising and promotion. A large proportion of this advertising is for energy-dense processed foods and is being directed at children and youth.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt;
Technological and transportation advancements are reducing the barriers that once limited global food trade. These techniques are critical to facilitating the production and distribution needed in a global market.  Better preservation techniques are helping to reduce waste which contributes to lower prices for consumers. Technology is creating higher yields which also reduce prices.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2006/&gt;

===Lifestyle changes===
The forces of globalization are strongly influencing many lifestyle changes in developing countries. Major changes in economic structures from agrarian economies to industrialized economies are reducing physical activity levels in occupations around the world.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a/&gt; Even in agricultural work, gas-powered technologies are helping reduce the energy expenditure needed to perform pertinent farming tasks. These reduced activity levels are not just seen in the workplace, but in homes as well. Daily tasks that were once laborious engagements are now much easier with the help of technological advancements, with examples being appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators, and stoves. Also, recent leaps in the efficiency of food production (canning, refrigeration, freezing, and packaging being a few of the most notable) and improvements in cookware, such as the introduction of improved metal stoves which use fossil fuels and microwave ovens, have helped reduce domestic efforts greatly.&lt;ref name=Popkin2001a/&gt;

Leisure is being greatly impacted as well. Activities such as playing sports outside are being replaced with television watching and computer games.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt; Decreasing physical leisure activities can also be contributed to urbanization wherein access to fields needed to play such games as soccer are not available due to such dense populations and their subsequent demand for land.&lt;ref name=Brody2002/&gt; Other important lifestyle changes fueling the nutrition transition relate to the composition of diets. These dietary shifts have been mentioned previously several times but deserve greater scrutiny. Diets rich in legumes, other vegetables, and coarse grains are disappearing in all regions and countries. Taking their place are diets characterized by fat-rich edible and vegetable oils, cheap animal-source foods high in fat and protein, and artificially sweetened foods high in sugar and refined carbohydrates. Consumption of caloric beverages such as soda represented 21% of all calorie intake in Mexico from 1996 to 2002.&lt;ref name=Popkin2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2011/&gt; Processes of globalization that have influenced food markets have made these products much cheaper, flavorful, and easier to produce which has in turn driven up their demand. So while globalization and the accompanying economic development has created higher levels of food security for developing countries, the ongoing trend of eating in a more Western fashion has caused increased rates of adverse health and childhood obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewnowski A, Popkin BM | year = 1997 | title = The Nutrition Transition: New Trends in the Global Diet | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 31–43 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1997.tb01593 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopsychosocial forces===
The desires for these new diets and lifestyles are very understandable from a biological and psychosocial perspective. For example, humans have an innate preference for sweets dating back to [[hunter-gatherer]] populations. These sweets signaled a good source of energy for hunter-gatherers that were not food secure. This same concept also relates to human predisposition for energy-dense fatty foods. These foods were needed to sustain long journeys and provided a safety net for times of famine. Humans also desire to eliminate physical exertion. This can explain the shift to more sedentary lifestyles from occupational, domestic, and leisurely activities that were previously much more physical taxing.&lt;ref name=Popkin2011/&gt; 
Socioeconomic and cultural influences also contribute to lifestyle changes associated with nutrition transition. The transfer of tastes by means of [[tourism]] and open food trade has introduced developing nations to foods previously enjoyed only by industrialized countries. Global food [[advertising]] and promotion has only further cemented these dietary changes.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt; Additionally some cultures view obese body types in high regard as they relate them to power, beauty and affluence.&lt;ref name=Prentice2006/&gt; Several studies suggest that [[socioeconomic status]] contributes greatly to nutrition transition wherein there is a lack of [[healthy diet|healthy food]] alternatives completely or a lack of affordable healthy food alternatives.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mont2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monteiro CA, Conde WL, Lu B, Popkin BM | title = Obesity and inequities in health in the developing world | journal = International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 1181–6 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15211362 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franco2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco M, Diez Roux AV, Glass TA, Caballero B, Brancati FL | title = Neighborhood characteristics and availability of healthy foods in Baltimore | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 561–7 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18842389 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and economic outcomes==
While increased [[food security]] is a major benefit of global nutrition transition, there are a myriad of coinciding negative health and economic consequences. Rates of obesity are soaring across the world and recent trends suggest that incidences of [[overnutrition]] in coming decades will overtake that of [[undernutrition]] in the developing world. As well there will be a marked [[epidemiological transition|epidemiological shift]] from [[infectious disease]] to degenerative, [[noncommunicable disease]], NCDs in these countries.&lt;ref name=Chopra2002/&gt; As it stands now these countries face a unique paradox in having to deal with both over- and undernutrition, a dual burden of malnutrition, that will inevitably be accompanied by both infectious and noncommunicable diseases, a dual burden of disease.&lt;ref name=Caba2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballero B | title = A nutrition paradox--underweight and obesity in developing countries | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 15 | pages = 1514–6 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15829531 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp048310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanu2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanumihardjo SA, Anderson C, Kaufer-Horwitz M, Bode L, Emenaker NJ, Haqq AM, Satia JA, Silver HJ, Stadler DD | title = Poverty, obesity, and malnutrition: an international perspective recognizing the paradox | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 107 | issue = 11 | pages = 1966–72 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17964317 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2007.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vonke2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vonke D | year = 2011 | title = The Paradox of Malnutrition in Developing Countries | journal = African Research Review | volume = 5 | issue = 19| pages = 40–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Uauy2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uauy R, Albala C, Kain J | title = Obesity trends in Latin America: transiting from under- to overweight | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 893S–899S | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11238781 | doi = 10.1093/jn/131.3.893S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic impact will be enormous as well.

===Health outcomes===
The foremost health outcome of the global nutrition transition will be an increased prevalence of obesity across the world. Obesity prevalence in developing countries increased from 2.3% in 1988 to 19.6% in 1998.&lt;ref name=Popkin1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM, Doak CM | title = The obesity epidemic is a worldwide phenomenon | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 106–14 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9584495 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1998.tb01722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidences are highest among women and children, indicating health inequities across global populations.&lt;ref name=Misra2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Misra A, Khurana L | title = Obesity and the metabolic syndrome in developing countries | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 93 | issue = 11 Suppl 1 | pages = S9-30 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18987276 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2008-1595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obesity is strongly linked to degenerative, NCDs such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension. WHO estimates place NCDs as the principal global cause of morbidity and mortality,&lt;ref name=WHR1997&gt;{{cite book | title = World Health Report 1997: Conquering Suffering, Enriching Humanity | location = Geneva | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and global prevalence of chronic diseases is projected to increase substantially over the next 2 decades in developing countries.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt; Between 1990 and 2020, mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]], CVDs, in developing countries is expected to increase 120% for women and 137% for men compared to 29 and 49% respectively in industrialized countries.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt; In many of the countries facing epidemics of overnutrition, there is still widespread undernutrition.

===Dual burden of disease===
Deemed as a developmental challenge of epidemic proportions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11138.doc.htm | title = Non-Communicable Diseases Deemed Development Challenge of ‘Epidemic Proportions’ in Political Declaration Adopted During Landmark General Assembly Summit |publisher=Un.org |date= |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the double burden of disease (DBD) is an emerging global health challenge, that exists predominately in low-to-middle income countries. More specifically, the DBD refers to the dual burden of communicable and [[non-communicable disease]]s(NCD). Today, over 90 per cent of the world’s disease burden occurs in developing regions, and most are attributed to communicable diseases.  Communicable diseases are [[infectious disease]]s that  “can be passed between people through proximity, social contact or intimate contact.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vancouver Coastal Health |url=http://www.vch.ca/your_health/communicable_diseases/ |title=Communicable Diseases -Vancouver Coastal Health |publisher=Vch.ca |date=2013-01-16 |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common diseases in this category include whooping cough or tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs, malaria, influenza (the flu), and mumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boutayeb A, Boutayeb S | title = The burden of non communicable diseases in developing countries | journal = International Journal for Equity in Health | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 2 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15651987 | pmc = 546417 | doi = 10.1186/1475-9276-4-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    
As low-to-middle income countries continue to develop, the types of diseases that affecting populations within these countries shifts primarily from infectious diseases, such as diarrhea and pneumonia, to primarily non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity.  This shift is increasingly being referred to as the risk transition.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases |title=WHO/Europe &amp;#124; Noncommunicable diseases |publisher=Euro.who.int |date=2013-06-14 |access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as globalization and the proliferation of pre-packaged foods continues, traditional diets and lifestyles are changing in many developing countries.  As such, it is becoming increasingly common to see low-to-middle income countries battle with century old issues such as food insecurity and under nutrition, in addition to emerging health epidemics such as chronic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes.  Diseases once characteristic of industrialized nations, are increasingly becoming health challenges of epidemic proportions in many low-to-middle income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/2_background/en/index1.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; 2. Background |publisher=Who.int |date= |access-date=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic impact===
The economic impact of these rising rates and dual burdens of disease looks to be tremendous. Disability, decreased quality of life, greater use of health care facilities, and increased absenteeism are strong associated with obesity.&lt;ref name=Misra2008/&gt;  With inadequate resources, poorly construed health systems, and a general lack of expertise to address the burden of infective diseases, the disease burden for low-to-middle countries is exacerbated by the rising rate of non-communicable diseases. This is often attributed to the fact that these countries by nature have ill-health systems that possess inadequate resources to detect and prevent many non-communicable diseases.”&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"/&gt;  Social constructs within these countries often amplify the risk of the double burden, as inequality, gender, and other social determinants often have a role to play in disparate access and allocation of health services and resources.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"/&gt;  If current trends are maintained, the World Health Organization predicts that low-and-middle income countries will be unable to support the burden of disease within the foreseeable future.

==Implications for policy==
Countries worldwide have made several, varied efforts to address the consequences of the nutrition transition. These policies target the food environment, governance, food system, or education and can be generally classified into the following categories:

=== Public Nutrition Education Policy ===
[[Nutrition Education|Nutrition education]] intends to facilitate healthy behavioral changes, at the individual level. Dietary guidelines, specifically, promote public awareness of nutritional needs. Over 60 countries in the Global North and South have established national dietary guidelines.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Q, Liu S, Liu R, Xue H, Wang Y | title = Food Policy Approaches to Obesity Prevention: An International Perspective | journal = Current Obesity Reports | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–82 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 25705571 | doi = 10.1007/s13679-014-0099-6 | pmc = 4333683 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrition Labeling Policy ===
Nutrition labeling for food packages and in restaurants may encourage consumers to choose healthier foods. Nutrition labeling has been emphasized as important in influencing food choices and potentially reducing the intake of fat, sugar, and sodium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== School-focused Policy ===
Schools are viewed as a primary target of intervention for implementing nutrition-related policies. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to exposure to unhealthy foods before, during, and after school. Children are more susceptible to developing early obesity and are likely to remain obese throughout adulthood. School policies are varied and specific to the political, economic, and social climates of a place. They can focus on increasing nutritional standards, promoting active lifestyles, regulating school meal programs, and banning the sale of certain foods and beverages in and around schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Food Marketing Regulation ===
[[Food marketing]], via several media outlets - television, the Internet, packaging, popular culture - has been an effective strategy for influencing and changing consumers' food choices, particularly among children. Several studies have indicated the association between exposure to food advertising and food choices and beliefs. The impact of advertising has led to support for government level regulation of food marketing. Countries have implemented voluntary or mandatory restrictions on advertisements of unhealthy food products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Food companies are also urged to implement responsible food marketing strategies. Efforts by corporations should reverse drivers of food consumption, including convenience, low cost, good taste, and nutritional knowledge. Recommendations include downsizing packaging, reducing serving sizes, and recreating formulas to decrease caloric content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witkowski|first=Terrence H. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2007|title=Food Marketing and Obesity in Developing Countries: Analysis, Ethics, and Public Policy|journal=Journal of Macromarketing|volume=27.2|pages=126-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxation ===
Stemming from the success of taxation of tobacco products in reducing tobacco usage, policy makers and researchers have adopted a parallel approach for reducing obesity. The WHO supported economic policies as a method of influencing food prices and promoting healthy eating in public spaces (cite, 2008). Tax policies, in the form of [[Sin tax|sin taxes]] or [[Pigovian tax|Pigovian taxes]], generally target unhealthy food and drink products, including the "[[fat tax]]," "junk food tax," and of particular popularity, the [[Sugary drink tax|tax on sugar-sweetened beverages]] (SSBs). Taxation is intended to combat obesity by increasing the price of SSBs and unhealthy foods and in turn, reducing their consumption, as well as generating revenue that may be used towards obesity prevention programs or promotion of fruit and vegetable consumption.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the effectiveness of taxation remains under scrutiny - economists argue that taxes are inefficient for combating obesity and can result in greater losses for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mann|first=Stefan| name-list-format = vanc |date=2008|title=Framing Obesity in Economic Theory and Policy| jstor = 29770461 |journal=Review of Social Economy|volume=66|issue=2|pages=163–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehensive Approach ===
The literature suggests that it may be ideal for governments to adopt a holistic policy approach to address the obesity epidemic, given the associated social conditions.&lt;ref name="Weiler_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiler R, Stamatakis E, Blair S | title = Should health policy focus on physical activity rather than obesity? Yes | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = c2603 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20501586 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c2603 | jstor = 40702159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Policy package" recommendations have been a supported framework for preventing obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases worldwide because they are adaptable to country-specific circumstances. For example, the NOURISHING framework summarizes key avenues for action and policy but is flexible to suit a range of national and local contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes C, Jewell J, Allen K | title = A food policy package for healthy diets and the prevention of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases: the NOURISHING framework | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 14 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 159–68 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24103073 | doi = 10.1111/obr.12098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization has called for governments to have multi-faceted interventions, focusing on food security, food safety, healthy lifestyle, and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roussev|first=Leslie | name-list-format = vanc |date=2014|title=The WHO's CRASH DIET: The role of governments in the international obesity crisis and why the global strategy falls short| jstor = 24889898 |journal=The International Lawyer|volume=48|issue=1|pages=51–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the scope of the pandemic but the diverse place-based trends and risk factors, appropriate and adequate intervention calls for policy change across multiple levels - population and individual - and the need for international collaboration.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malik VS, Willett WC, Hu FB | title = Global obesity: trends, risk factors and policy implications | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews. Endocrinology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–27 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23165161 | doi = 10.1038/nrendo.2012.199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, evaluations of programs and initiatives on their impact on obesity are necessary to both enhance efficacy of existing interventions and provide a foundation for future interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM, Adair LS, Ng SW | title = Global nutrition transition and the pandemic of obesity in developing countries | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–21 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22221213 | pmc = 3257829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00456.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
Case studies for individual nations are plentiful. The [[BRICS]] countries are specifically studied in great depth because of their rapidly transitioning economies, but more slowly developing nations are well studied too.

===Industrialized nations===
Case studies in the United States and United Kingdom are particularly bountiful.&lt;ref name=Lang2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = Recent dynamics suggest selected countries catching up to US obesity | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 284S–288S | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19906804 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28473C | pmc = 2793114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing countries===
Reports based in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and developed areas of sub-Saharan Africa can be found in a wide range of academic literature.&lt;ref name=Hawkes2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shufa2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Uauy2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mok2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mokhtar N, Elati J, Chabir R, Bour A, Elkari K, Schlossman NP, Caballero B, Aguenaou H | title = Diet culture and obesity in northern Africa | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pages = 887S–892S | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11238780 | doi = 10.1093/jn/131.3.887S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popkin2002b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popkin BM | title = The shift in stages of the nutrition transition in the developing world differs from past experiences! | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 1A | pages = 205–14 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 12027286 | doi = 10.1079/PHN2001295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riosmena F, Frank R, Akresh IR, Kroeger RA | title = U.S. Migration, Translocality, and the Acceleration of the Nutrition Transition in Mexico | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers.

===Aboriginal populations===
Worldwide, [[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal populations]] have experienced radical changes in diet. Traditional diets and food intakes have been replaced by diets consisting of foods high in fat, sugar and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S | title = Assessing diet and lifestyle in the Canadian Arctic Inuit and Inuvialuit to inform a nutrition and physical activity intervention programme | journal = Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics | volume = 23 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 5–17 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 21158957 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-277X.2010.01093.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change in diet is related to the life-style changes during the last century: for example, Hunter-gatherer communities became more settled, and traditional food gathering methods changed. The nutrition transition has been linked to increased rates of [[non-communicable diseases]] amongst Aboriginal populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhnlein HV, Receveur O, Soueida R, Egeland GM | title = Arctic indigenous peoples experience the nutrition transition with changing dietary patterns and obesity | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 1447–53 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15173410 | doi = 10.1093/jn/134.6.1447 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialization introduced a less complicated way to access food; a protein rich diet was replaced by white bread, processed food and sugary beverages.

Traditional food of [[First Nations]] included [[burbot]] filet (or muscle) and [[moose]] liver. Food consumption provided essential fats (i.e., fatty acids) and proteins that played a key medicinal role in the prevention and reduction of obesity and obesity-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robidoux MA, Haman F, Sethna C | title = The relationship of the burbot (Lota lota L.) to the reintroduction of off-the-land foods in the Sandy Lake First Nation Community | journal = Biodemography and Social Biology | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–29 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19835098 | doi = 10.1080/19485560903054630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5493">[[Tanzania]] has a number of laws and regulations that govern '''[[occupational safety and health]]''' (OSH) protections for workers.  The [[International Labour Organization]] reports that due to insufficient statistics and consistent reporting, it is impossible to determine the number of workplace accidents that occur in the country.  

==History of OSH law in Tanzania==
The first law in Tanzania that related to workers health and safety was the Factories Ordinances Cap. 297 of 1950, that provided for occupational health and safety standards for workers in factories.  As most of Tanzania's workforce was employed in the agricultural sector, this ordinance left most workers in the country unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH - COUNTRY PROFILE TANZANIA|last = |first = |publisher = International Labour Organization|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = 1|url = http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---safework/documents/policy/wcms_187634.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This law was replaced in 2003 with the new ''Occupational Health and Safety Act No. 5 of 2003'', which covers workers in all sectors, including within the public sector and in local government authorities.

In addition to the general act, the country has also adopted a number of laws providing for protection in individual industries that are perceived to be more hazardous that usual.  Some of these laws include:
* ''Tropical Pesticides Research Institute Act of 1979''
* ''Pharmaceuticals and Poison Act of 1978''
* ''Atomic Energy Act of 2003''
* ''Industrial and Consumer Chemicals Act of 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ILO|title=Occupational safety and health: Tanzania Country profile, 2004|url=//www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---safework/documents/policy/wcms_187634.pdf|website=ILO|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' 
* ''Public Health Act of 2009''
* ''Mining Act of 2010''
The ''Employment and Labour Relation Act No. 6 of 2004'' also contains provisions for OSH, although it is primarily concerned with industrial relations matters rather than worker safety.

In 2008 another important step was made; The establishment of Workers' Compensation Fund through Workers Compensation Act No. 20 of 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ILO|title=The United Republic of Tanzania: Workers Compensation Act No. 20 of 2008|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_125593.pdf|website=ILO|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with objectives of providing for compensation to employees for disablement of death caused by or result from injuries or diseases sustained or contracted in the course of employment; to establish Fund for administration and regulation of workers compensation and to provide for related matter.

==Statistics==
Status of [[occupational accidents]] and [[injuries]] varies considerably between different sources. It is estimated that in [[mining]] and quarry sector, the injury rate   is 17 per 1000 workers whereas the manufacturing sector is responsible for 10.1% of total occupational accidents, 9.6% of [[Death|fatalities]], 12.2% of partial disabilities and about 7.4% of temporary disability and the [[injury rate]] is 9.9 per 1,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=TCRB|title=Contractors registration Board: Status of Occupational Health and Safety in Tanzanian Construction Industry|url=http://www.crbtz.org/documents/newsletter/dec2009/ohsstatus.pdf|website=tcrb|accessdate=5 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005034202/http://www.crbtz.org/documents/newsletter/dec2009/ohsstatus.pdf|archivedate=5 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Report from National Audit office (NAO) showed that [[construction]]/building industry  had highest Fatality rate of 23.7% followed by [[Transport]] and mining/quarrying that had 20.6% and 20.5 respectively (table 1 below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NAO|title=The United Republic of Tanzania, National Audit Office. A Performance Audit Report on The Management of Occupational Health and Safety in Tanzania, 2013|url=http://www.nao.go.tz/?wpfb_dl=98|website=nao.go.tz|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injuries in transport sector is another life-threatening risk that continues to claim lives of people especially motorcyclist and public transport (buses). however the major challenge in these information is validity and reliability as the reporting and data keeping system in Tanzania is not well coordinated.

The presented information may be challenged by several other factors as reporting system is not well functional.  There were a total of 6,599 registered workplaces equivalent to 24% of eligible workplaces. This lack of reliable information is a challenge to the authority dealing with OSH matters in Tanzania.

'''PSYCHLOPS''' ('''psychological outcome profiles''') is a type of [[psychological testing]], a [[Self-report inventory|tool]] used in [[primary care]] to measure mental health outcomes and as a [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life measure]].

It is also one intervention that has been adapted for use in children and adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in response to a demand for guidance on psychological interventions for people exposed to [[adversity]], including humanitarian disasters.

== Use in mental health care ==
PSYCHLOPS is a mental health outcome-measure tool used in primary care or community care settings and is self-completed. It measures mental health problems, quality of life, social functioning and wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Nationarchives"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130124045059/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_093677.pdf|title=Outcomes Compendium; helping you select the right tools for best mental health care practice in your field|last=National Institute for Mental Health in England|first=|publisher=Barts and The London Schoolof Medicine and Dentistry|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClinicalPsych2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnB8i0IFysMC&amp;pg=PT420|title=Issues in Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, and Counseling: 2011 Edition|publisher=ScholarlyEditions|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4649-6366-7|edition=11th|location=Atlanta, Georgia|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include the [[Beck Depression Inventory]], the [[CORE-OM]], [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7]] (GAD-7) and the [[PHQ-9|Patient Health Questionnaire]] (PHQ-9), amongst others.&lt;ref name="McQuaid"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-I78AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=What+you+really+need+to+know+about+counselling+and+psychotherapy+training+psychlops#v=onepage&amp;q=psychlops&amp;f=false|title=What You Really Need to Know about Counselling and Psychotherapy Training: An essential guide|last=McQuaid|first=Cathy|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-81333-4|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By comparing scores before, during and after completion of [[Psychotherapy|talking therapy]], the measure enables calculation of a change score. The change score indicates the change (improvement or deterioration) in perceived severity of problems during and following a course of talking therapy.&lt;ref name=Brinquete2015/&gt; PSYCHLOPS is a patient-generated outcome measure which means that measurement is based on items (issues) selected by patients rather than pre-specified items. By gathering information on patient-generated items, PSYCHLOPS contains a free text record (qualitative data) of the patient’s own perception of their problems which can be used for [[qualitative research]].&lt;ref name=Brinquete2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="EvansPsych"/&gt;

===WHO===
It is also one intervention that has been adopted by the WHO in response to a demand for guidance on psychological interventions for people exposed to adversity. This includes people caught up in [[humanitarian crisis|humanitarian crises]] and incorporates common mental health problems in a variety of countries, cultures and settings.&lt;ref name="WHO2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/206417/WHO_MSD_MER_16.2_eng.pdf;jsessionid=57A3AC1192842C3A3BF962F546E3090A?sequence=1|title=Problem Management Plus (PM+)|last=|first=|date=|website=apps.who.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHOPMPlus2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/emergencies/PM_plus_2018/en/|title=Scaling up capacity for Problem Management Plus (PM+)|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO has included it in two of their mental health programmes, Programme Management Plus (PM+)&lt;ref name="WHO2016" /&gt;and Self Help Plus (SH+),&lt;ref name=Brown2018&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Felicity|last2=Carswell|first2=K|last3=Augustinavicius|first3=Jura|last4=Adaku|first4=A|last5=R.

===Children===
PSYCHLOPS has been adapted for use in children. Unlike a [[checklist]], "PSYCHLOPS Kids" allows children to identify their worries themselves.&lt;ref name=Kings2018&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/spotlight-article.aspx?id=8dcdc004-aaac-4290-9bb2-d208b1702427|title=New tool gets children's perspective on own mental health|last=|first=|date=29 May 2018|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KingsTool&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/june-2018/assessing-childrens-mental-health-concerns|title=Assessing children's mental health concerns {{!}} The Psychologist|last=|first=|date=|website=thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For children taking part in [[drama therapy]], they have the potential to recognise the impact of their therapy. The reliance on the support of school staff has been reported as one limitation.&lt;ref name="Haythorne2012"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dQMmpi2XJagC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=psychlops&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv_ZbPq8DdAhVLQMAKHczyDfoQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=psychlops&amp;f=false|title=Dramatherapy with Children, Young People, and Schools: Enabling Creativity, Sociability, Communication and Learning|last=Haythorne|first=Deborah|last2=Crockford|first2=Susan|last3=Godfrey|first3=Emma|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415670760|editor-last=Leigh|editor-first=Lauraine|location=|pages=192|language=en|chapter=19.

==Procedure==
PSYCHLOPS is completed by the individual person.&lt;ref name="Nationarchives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EvansPsych"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/PDF/CALCMPconf2013Chris%20Evans.pdf|title=The danger of trading measures but not meeting distressed minds: "outcome" measurement in MH and psychological therapies|last=Evans|first=Chris|date=|website=www.psychtc.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific sequence of questions is included in the questionnaire which address the respondent’s greatest and least worries. These concerns are then scored.&lt;ref name=Kings2018/&gt; Subsequently, the answers and scores can be used to evaluate their perception of the change in their problems as a result of counselling or other talking therapy.&lt;ref name=Brinquete2015/&gt; It uses a six-point scale rather than the seven used in its sister questionnaire, MYMOP.&lt;ref name="Bristol"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/primaryhealthcare/resources/mymop/sisters/psychlops/|title=Psychlops {{!}} Centre for Academic Primary Care {{!}} University of Bristol|last=Bristol|first=University of|website=www.bristol.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure encompasses answering four questions on one sheet, with the first question being “Choose the problem that troubles you most?” This is followed by scoring it on a six-point scoring range and recording the duration of the problem. An outcome score is calculated using the scores of each of the before, during and after questionnaires.&lt;ref name="Ashworth2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashworth|first=Mark|last2=I.

==History==
PSYCHLOPS was designed by an academic British [[general practitioner]]&lt;ref name="McQuaid"/&gt; and was adapted from the [[self-report inventory]], MYMOP (Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile), another outcome measure first published in 1996 and mainly used for people who present with physical, emotional, or social symptoms.&lt;ref name=NCOR&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncor.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/MYMOP.pdf|title=National Council for Osteopathic Research; Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ncor.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
There has been debate as to whether to identify and measure individualized outcomes that are unique for each patient ([[idiographic]] approach) or to use standardized measures ([[nomothetic]] approach). Both measures have their advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name=Brinquete2015&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/bitstream/10174/17420/1/Patient-generated%20outcome%20measures%20and%20development%20the%20therapeutic%20alliance.pdf|title=Patient-generated outcome measures and development the therapeutic alliance|last=Brinquete|first=Cláudia Sofia Velez|publisher= University of Évora, Social Science School|year=2015|isbn=|location=Department Psychology, University of Évora|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a patient-generated measure, PSYCHLOPS appears a more sensitive (responsive) measure of change following a mental health intervention than some other standardised measures.&lt;ref name=KendrickBMJ2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kendrick|first=Tony|last2=Stuart|first2=Beth|last3=Leydon|first3=Geraldine M.|last4=Geraghty|first4=Adam W.

[[File:1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[1918 flu pandemic|The 1918–1919 "Spanish flu" pandemic]] resulted in dramatic mortality worldwide.]]

A '''pandemic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν ''pan'' "all" and δῆμος ''demos'' "people") is an [[epidemic]] of [[infectious disease]] that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple [[continents]], or even worldwide.

A widespread [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, [[Influenza pandemic|flu pandemics]] generally exclude recurrences of [[seasonal flu]]. Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. One of the most devastating pandemics was the [[Black Death]], which killed over 75 million people in 1350. The most recent pandemics include the [[HIV]] pandemic as well as the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]]  and [[2009 flu pandemic|2009]] [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] pandemics.

== Definition and stages ==

[[File:Pandemie.jpg|thumb|left|Advice (in French and English) for travellers on risks of epidemics abroad. Posters from the Charles De Gaulle airport, Paris, 2016.]]
A pandemic is an [[epidemic]] occurring on a scale which crosses international boundaries, usually affecting a large number of people.&lt;ref name=Porta2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Miquel Porta|editor=Miquel Porta|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dr8dyuzvTkC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=3 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531449-6|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandemics can also occur in important agricultural organisms (livestock, crop plants, fish, tree species) or in other organisms.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control until we stop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ "Current WHO phase of pandemic alert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928032422/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ |date=2011-09-28 }}, World Health Organization 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For instance, [[cancer]] is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=A. M.|first1=Dumar|title=Swine Flu: What You Need to Know|date=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458322|page=7|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ''ad interim'' for Health Security and Environment, WHO said "An easy way to think about pandemic … is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: 'What is a global outbreak'? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/influenzaAH1N1_presstranscript_20090526.pdf |title=WHO press conference on 2009 pandemic influenza |format=PDF |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled ''WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase''. The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|title=Pandemic influenza preparedness and response|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513194204/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910112007/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions of this document refer to influenza. The phases are defined by the spread of the disease; [[virulence]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] are not mentioned in the current WHO definition, although these factors have previously been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,637119,00.html |title=A whole industry is waiting for an epidemic |work=Der Spiegel |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pandemics and notable epidemics through history ==
{{See also|List of epidemics|Columbian Exchange|Globalization and disease}}

There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human [[history]], generally [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] which came about with [[domestication]] of animals, such as [[influenza]] and tuberculosis. There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the "mere" destruction of cities:
* [[Plague of Athens]], 430 BC. Possibly [[typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&amp;ref=sciam&amp;chanID=sa003 "Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid"].

* [[Antonine Plague]], 165–180 AD. Possibly smallpox brought to the Italian peninsula by soldiers returning from the Near East; it killed a quarter of those infected, and up to five million in all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm Past pandemics that ravaged Europe]. ''BBC News'', November 7. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of a second outbreak, the [[Plague of Cyprian]] (251–266), which may have been the same disease, 5,000 people a day were said to be dying in [[Rome]].
* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, was the first recorded outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]]. It started in [[Egypt]], and reached [[Constantinople]] the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]]) 10,000 a day at its height, and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. The plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the [[human population]] that it struck throughout the known world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521846390&amp;ss=fro |title=Cambridge Catalogue page "Plague and the End of Antiquity" |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html Quotes from book "Plague and the End of Antiquity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114235/http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Lester K.

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Disease killed part of the native population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century ([[Guanches]]). Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by smallpox.

=== Typhus ===
[[Typhus]] is sometimes called "camp fever" because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as "gaol fever" and "ship fever", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), about 8 million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence].

Historically, [[measles]] was prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. According to the U.S. [[National Immunization Program]], 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were an estimated 3–4 million
cases in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Center for Disease Control &amp; National Immunization Program. Measles History, article online 2001.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance.

== Concern about possible future pandemics ==

=== Viral hemorrhagic fevers ===
Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Ebola virus disease]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, sometimes referred to as "[[Antibiotic resistance|superbug]]s", may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm Researchers sound the alarm: the multidrug resistance of the plague bacillus could spread] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014012153/http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm |date=2007-10-14 }}. Pasteur.fr&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]. ''World Health Organization.''&lt;/ref&gt; China and India have the highest rate of multidrug-resistant TB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/01/bill-gates-tb-timebomb-china Bill Gates joins Chinese government in tackling TB 'timebomb']. ''Guardian.co.uk''. April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of [[MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States. There are about 40,000 new cases of XDR-TB per year, the WHO estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/tb.pandemic/index.html Tuberculosis: A new pandemic?]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past 20 years, common bacteria including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' and [[Enterococcus]], have developed resistance to various [[antibiotics]] such as [[vancomycin]], as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the [[aminoglycosides]] and [[cephalosporins]]. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. &lt;!-- Antibiotics are not described as "strongest"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed "broad spectrum". Vancomycin is only effective against Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --&gt; &lt;!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic --&gt;

=== SARS ===
In 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956–2003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.

=== Influenza ===
{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these species to other species, and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or, rarely, in humans.&lt;ref name=sobrino6&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |author=Klenk|year=2008 |chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range |title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-22-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawaoka&gt;{{cite book |author=Kawaoka Y (editor). |title=Influenza Virology: Current Topics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2006 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu |isbn=978-1-904455-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== H5N1 (Avian Flu) ====
{{Main|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1}}

In February 2004, [[avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish Flu]], or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].

From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MacKenzie D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China." Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC NEWS |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC NEWS | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.

Avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a "pandemic", because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006, there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2005). Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Infection in Humans http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra052211&lt;/ref&gt; Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients, and thus limiting person-to-person transmission.

=== Zika virus ===
{{Main|Zika virus outbreak in the Americas (2015–present)|Zika virus|Zika fever}}
An outbreak of [[Zika virus]] began in 2015 and strongly intensified throughout the start of 2016, with over 1.5 million cases across more than a dozen countries in [[the Americas]]. The World Health Organisation warned that Zika had the potential to become an explosive global pandemic if the outbreak was not controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35425731|title=Zika virus could become 'explosive pandemic'|date=28 January 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic consequences of pandemic events ===
In 2016, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century - over $60 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Neglected-Dimension-of-Global-Security.pdf|title=Global Health Risk Framework - The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises|last=|first=|date=2016-01-16|website=|publisher=National Academy of Medicine|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also recommended spending $4.5 billion annually on global prevention and response capabilities to reduce the threat posed by pandemic events.

== Biological warfare ==
{{Further|Biological warfare}}
In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged [[Crimea]]n city of [[Caffa|Kaffa]] (now [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]). After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wheelis M |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa |journal=Emerging Infect.

The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population was devastated after contact with the [[Old World]] by introduction of many fatal diseases. In a well documented case of germ warfare involving British commander [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] and Swiss-British officer Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]], their correspondence included a proposal and agreement to give smallpox-infected blankets to Indians in order to "Extirpate this Execrable Race". During the [[siege of Fort Pitt]] late in the [[French and Indian War]], as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, [[William Trent]], on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of "great numbers of Indians" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital to two Delaware Indian dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A.

During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), [[Unit 731]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted [[Japanese war crimes#Human experimentation and biological warfare|human experimentation]] on thousands, mostly Chinese. In military campaigns, the Japanese army used biological weapons on Chinese soldiers and civilians. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting [[cholera]], [[anthrax]], and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians.

Diseases considered for or known to be used as a weapon include [[anthrax]], [[ebola]], [[Marburg virus]], plague, [[cholera]], [[typhus]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[tularemia]], [[brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[machupo]], [[Coccidioides mycosis]], [[Glanders]], [[Melioidosis]], [[Shigella]], [[Psittacosis]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese B encephalitis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and smallpox.&lt;ref name="Alibek"/&gt;

Spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the Soviet [[closed city]] of [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] in 1979.

PGP has a long history of recognition, mentioned by [[Hippocrates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owens Kelly, Pearson Anne, Mason Gerald | year = 2002 | title = Pubic Symphysis Separation | url = | journal = Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 141–155 | doi=10.2017/s0965539502000244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later described in medical literature by Snelling.&lt;ref name=childbearing&gt;Pain In Childbearing, Key Issues In Management, Margaret Yerby, Lesley Page.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Prior to the 20th century, specialists of pregnancy-related PGP used varying terminologies. It is now referred to as Pregnancy Related Pelvic Girdle Pain that may incorporate the following conditions:

* [[Diastasis symphysis pubis|Diastasis of the Symphysis Pubis]](DSP)
* [[Symphysis pubis dysfunction]](SPD)
* Pelvic Joint Syndrome
* Physiological Pelvic Girdle Relaxation
* Symptom Giving Pelvic Girdle Relaxation
* Posterior Pelvic Pain
* Pelvic Arthropathy
* Inferior Pubic Shear/ Superior Pubic Shear /Symphyseal Shear
* Symphysiolysis
* [[Osteitis pubis]] (usually postpartum)
* [[Sacroiliac joint|Sacroiliitis]]
* One-sided Sacroiliac Syndrome /Double Sided Sacroiliac Syndrome
* [[Hypermobility (joints)|Hypermobility]]

''"The classification between hormonal and mechanical pelvic girdle instability is no longer used. For treatment and/or prognosis it makes no difference whether the complaints started during pregnancy or after childbirth." Mens (2005)''&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;About Pelvic Girdle Instability. Definition and Concept. Jan M.A. Mens.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
A combination of postural changes,baby, unstable pelvic joints under the influence of pregnancy hormones, and changes in the centre of gravity can all add to the varying degrees of pain or discomfort. In some cases it can come on suddenly or following a fall, sudden abduction of the thighs (opening too wide too quickly) or an action that has strained the joint.

PGP can begin as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Pain is usually felt low down over the [[Symphysis|symphyseal joint]], and this area may be extremely tender to the touch. Pain may also be felt in the [[hips]], [[groin]] and [[abdomen|lower abdomen]] and can radiate down the inner thighs. Women suffering from PGP may begin to waddle or shuffle, and may be aware of an audible clicking sound coming from the pelvis. PGP can develop slowly during pregnancy, gradually gaining in severity as the pregnancy progresses.

During pregnancy and [[postpartum]], the symphyseal gap can be felt moving or straining when walking, climbing stairs or turning over in bed; these activities can be difficult or even impossible. The pain may remain static, e.g., in one place such as the front of the pelvis, producing the feeling of having been kicked; in other cases it may start in one area and move to other areas. It is also possible that a woman may experience a combination of symptoms.

Any weight bearing activity has the potential of aggravating an already unstable pelvis, producing symptoms that may limit the ability of the woman to carry out many daily activities. She may experience pain involving movements such as dressing, getting in and out of the bath, rolling in bed, climbing the stairs or sexual activity. Pain may also be present when lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling.

The symptoms (and their severity) experienced by women with PGP vary, but include:

* Present swelling and/or inflammation over joint.
* Difficulty lifting leg.
* Pain pulling legs apart.
* Inability to stand on one leg.
* Inability to transfer weight through pelvis and legs.
* Pain in hips and/or restriction of hip movement.
* Transferred nerve pain down leg.
* Can be associated with bladder and/or bowel dysfunction.
* A feeling of the symphysis pubis giving way.
* Stooped back when standing.
* Malalignment of pelvic and/or back joints.
* Struggle to sit or stand.
* Pain may also radiate down the inner thighs.
* Waddling or shuffling gait.
* Audible ‘clicking’ sound coming from the pelvis.

===Severity===
The severity and instability of the pelvis can be measured on a three level scale.

'''Pelvic type 1:'''The pelvic ligaments support the pelvis sufficiently. Even when the
muscles are used incorrectly, no complaints will occur when performing everyday activities. This is the most common situation in persons who have never been pregnant, who have never been in an accident, and who are not hypermobile.''

'''Pelvic type 2:'''The ligaments alone do not support the joint sufficiently. A
coordinated use of muscles around the joint will compensate for ligament weakness. In case the muscles around the joint do not function, the patient will experience pain and weakness when performing everyday activities. This type often occurs after giving birth to a child weighing 3000&amp;nbsp;grams or more, in cases of hypermobility, and sometimes after an accident involving the pelvis. Type 2 is the most common form of pelvic instability. Treatment is based on learning how to use the muscles around the pelvis more efficiently.

'''Pelvic type 3:'''The ligaments do not support the joint sufficiently. This is a serious
situation whereby the muscles around the joint are unable to compensate for ligament weakness. This type of pelvic instability usually only occurs after an accident, or occasionally after a (small) accident in combination with giving birth. Sometimes a small accident occurring long before giving birth is forgotten so that the pelvic instability is attributed only to the childbirth. Although the difference between Type 2 and 3 is often difficult to establish, in case of doubt an exercise program may help the patient. However, if Pelvic Type 3 has been diagnosed then invasive treatment is the only option: in this case parts of the pelvis are screwed together. (Mens 2005)&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

===Psychosocial impact===
PGP in pregnancy seriously interferes with participation in society and activities of daily life; the average sick leave due to posterior pelvic pain during pregnancy is 7 to 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Noren Lotta RPT |author2=Ostgaard Solveig |author3=Nielsen Thorkild F |author4=Ostgaard Hans C | year = 1997 | title = Reduction of Sick Leave for Lumbar Back and Posterior Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 22 | issue = 18| pages = 2157–2160 | doi=10.1097/00007632-199709150-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases women with PGP may also experience emotional problems such as anxiety over the cause of pain, resentment, anger, lack of self-esteem, frustration and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; she is three times more likely to suffer [[Postpartum depression|postpartum depressive symptoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gutke A, Josefsson A, Oberg B | date = Jun 2007 | title = Pelvic girdle pain and lumbar pain in relation to postpartum depressive symptoms | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 32 | issue = 13| pages = 1430–6 | doi=10.1097/brs.0b013e318060a673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other psychosocial risk factors associated with woman experiencing PGP include higher level of stress, low job satisfaction and poorer relationship with spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Albert HB, Godskesen M, Korsholm L, Westergaard JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk factors in developing pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 85 | issue = 5| pages = 539–44 | doi=10.1080/00016340600578415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Sometimes there is no obvious explanation for the cause of PGP but usually there is a combination of factors such as:

# The pelvic joints moving unevenly.
# A change in the activity of the muscles in the pelvis, [[Hip (anatomy)|hip]], abdomen, back and [[pelvic floor]].
# A history of pelvic trauma.
# The position of the baby altering the loading stresses on the pelvic ligaments and joints.
# Strenuous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juhl Mette |author2=Kragh Andersen Per |author3=Olsen Jørn |author4=Nybo Andersen Anne-Marie | year = 2005 | title = Psychosocial and Physical Work Environment and Risk of Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy.

Pregnancy related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) can be either specific (trauma or injury to pelvic joints or genetical i.e. [[connective tissue disease]]) and non-specific.

[[Pregnancy]] begins the [[Physiology|physiological changes]] through a pattern of hormonal secretion and [[signal transduction]] thus initiating the remodelling of soft tissues, cartilage and ligaments. Over time, the ligaments could be stretched either by injury or excess strain and in turn may cause PGP.

=== Anatomy===
The [[pelvis]] is the largest bony part of the [[skeleton]] and contains three joints: the [[pubic symphysis]], and [[sacroiliac joint|two sacroiliac joints]]. A highly durable network of [[ligament]]s surrounds these joints giving them tremendous strength.

The pubic symphysis has a [[Fibrocartilage| fibrocartilage joint]] which may contain a fluid filled cavity and is [[avascular]]; it is supported by the [[Superior pubic ligament|superior]] and [[Inferior pubic ligament|arcuate ligaments]]. The sacroiliac joints are [[Synovial fluid|synovial]], but their movement is restricted throughout life and they are progressively obliterated by [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]]. The nature of the bony pelvic ring with its three joints determines that no one joint can move independently of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;SPD: The Clinical Presentation, Prevalence, Aetiology, Risk Factors and Morbidity.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Relaxin hormone===
[[Relaxin]] is a [[hormone]] produced mainly by the [[corpus luteum]] of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females. During pregnancy it is also produced by the [[placenta]], [[chorion]], and [[decidua]]. The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of [[collagen]] thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, [[tendon]]s, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.

Although relaxin's main cellular action in pregnancy is to remodel collagen by [[biosynthesis]] (thus facilitating the changes of connective tissue) it does not seem to generate musculoskeletal problems. European Research has determined that relaxin levels are not a predictor of PGP during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petersen LK, Hvidman L, Uldbjerg N | year = 1994 | title = Normal Serum Relaxin in Women with Disabling Pelvic Pain During Pregnancy | url = | journal = Gynecol Obstet Invest | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 21–3 | doi=10.1159/000292438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Björklund K, Bergström S, Nordström ML, Ulmsten U | date = Apr 2000 | title = Symphyseal Distention in Relation to Serum Relaxin Levels and Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 269–75 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0412.2000.079004269.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hansen A, Jensen DV, Larsen E, Wilken-Jensen C, Petersen LK | date = Mar 1996 | title = Relaxin is not related to symptom-giving pelvic girdle relaxation in pregnant women | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 75 | issue = 3| pages = 245–9 | doi=10.3109/00016349609047095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Albert H, Godskesen M, Westergaard JG, Chard T, Gunn L | date = Jul 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. | volume = 74 | issue = 1| pages = 19–22 | doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gait changes===
The pregnant woman has a different pattern of "[[Gait analysis|gait]]". The step lengthens as the pregnancy progresses due to weight gain and changes in posture. Both the length and height of the footstep shortens with PGP. Sometimes the foot can turn inwards due to the rotation of the hips when the pelvic joints are unstable. On average, a woman's foot can grow by a half size or more during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones that are released to adapt the bodily changes also remodel the ligaments in the foot. In addition, the increased body weight of pregnancy, fluid retention and weight gain lowers the arches, further adding to the foot's length and width. There is an increase of load on the lateral side of the foot and the hind foot. These changes may also be responsible for the musculoskeletal complaints of lower limb pain in pregnant women.

During the motion of walking, an upward movement of the pelvis, one side then the other, is required to let the leg follow through. The faster or longer each step the pelvis adjusts accordingly. The flexibility within the knees, ankles and hips are stabilized by the pelvis. Normal gait tends to minimize displacement of centre of gravity whereas abnormal gait through pelvic instability tends to amplify displacement. During pregnancy there may be an increased demand placed on hip abductor, hip extensor, and [[Ankle|ankle plantar flexor muscles]] during walking. To avoid pain on weight bearing structures a very short stance phase and limp occurs on the injured side(s), this is called [[Gait abnormality|Antalgic Gait]].

==Treatment==
A number of treatments have some evidence for benefits include an exercise program.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; [[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) has not been found effective but is safe.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; [[NSAID]]s are sometimes effective but should not be used after 30 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; There is tentative evidence for [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name=Ver2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstraete|first1=EH|last2=Vanderstraeten|first2=G|last3=Parewijck|first3=W|title=Pelvic Girdle Pain during or after Pregnancy: a review of recent evidence and a clinical care path proposal.|journal=Facts, views &amp; vision in ObGyn|date=2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=33–43|pmid=24753927|pmc=3987347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pelvic joint trauma will not respond to conservative type treatments and [[orthopedic surgery]] might become the only option to stabilize the joints.

==Prognosis and epidemiology==
For most women, PGP resolves in weeks after delivery but for some it can last for years resulting in a reduced tolerance for [[weight bearing]] activities. PGP can take from 11 weeks, 6 months or even up to 2 years postpartum to subside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Larsen EC, Wilken-Jensen C, Hansen A, Jensen DV, Johansen S, Minck H, Wormslev M, Davidsen M, Hansen TM | date = Feb 1999 | title = Symptom-Giving Pelvic Girdle Relaxation in Pregnancy.

Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Wu, O. G. Meijer, K. Uegaki, J. M. A. Mens, J. H. van Dieën, P. I. J. M. Wuisman, H. C.

'''Proximates''' are used in the analysis of biological materials as a decomposition of a human-consumable good into its major constituents.  They are a good approximation of the contents of packaged comestible goods and serve as a cost-effective and easy verification of nutritional panels. This means that testing can be used to verify lots, but cannot be used to validate a food processor or food processing facility; instead, a nutritional assay must be conducted on the product to qualify said producers. Nutritional panels in the United States are regulated by the FDA and must undergo rigorous testing to ensure the exact and precise content of nutrients. This should prevent food processors from making unfounded claims to the public.&lt;ref group=FDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Labeling &amp; Nutrition|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064894.htm|work=Guidance for Industry: A Food Labeling Guide (7. Nutrition Labeling; Questions G1 through P8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industry, the standard proximates are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silliker Labs|url=http://www.merieuxnutrisciences.com/us/eng/silliker/our-solutions/chemistry/food-quality/345|work=Food Quality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Covance|url=http://nutri.covance.com/catalog/4-addassay.php?assay_id=238|work=Proximate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurofins|url=http://www.eurofinsus.com/services/Proximate_Testing.html|work=Proximate Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ash
*Moisture
*Proteins
*Fat
*Carbohydrates (calculated)
Analytically, four of the five constituents are obtained via chemical reactions and experiments. The fifth constituent, carbohydrates, are calculated based on the determination of the four others. Proximates should nearly always account for 100% of a food product; any deviation from 100% displays the resolution of the chemical test, as small variations in the way each test is performed accumulate or overlap the compositional make-up.

There are additional ingredients that may fall under the category of one of the five constituents. Carbohydrates, for example, include but are not limited to:
*Dietary fibers
*Sugars
*Sugar alcohol 
Whereas ash includes but is not limited to:
*Dietary minerals (sodium, potassium, iron, calcium)
*Vitamins (β-Carotene, retinol, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, B vitamins)  
Although proximates do not give the entire nutritional assay, they are an inexpensive way to track deviations in the quality of foods.

'''Rete tubular ectasia''' is a [[benign]] condition, usually found in older men, involving numerous small, tubular [[cystic]] structures within the [[rete testis]].

==Mechanism==
The formation of cysts in the rete testis is associated with the obstruction of the [[efferent ducts]], which connect the rete testis with the head of the [[epididymis]]. They are often bilateral.&lt;ref name=nair&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nair|first1=R|last2=Abbaraju|first2=J|last3=Rajbabu|first3=K|last4=Anjum|first4=F|last5=Sriprasad|first5=S|title=Tubular ectasia of the rete testis: a diagnostic dilemma.|journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England|date=October 2008|volume=90|issue=7|pages=1–3|doi=10.1308/147870808X303119|pmid=18831860|pmc=2728311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The condition can be detected with sonography. It is commonly associated with epididymal abnormalities, such as [[spermatocele]], [[epididymal cyst]], and [[epididymitis]]. The condition  shares a common location with [[cystic dysplasia]] of the [[testis]] and [[intratesticular cysts]]. Unlike cystic neoplasms, they don't present specific tumor markers.&lt;ref name=bhatt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhatt|first1=S|last2=Jafri|first2=SZ|last3=Wasserman|first3=N|last4=Dogra|first4=VS|title=Imaging of non-neoplastic intratesticular masses.|journal=Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology (Ankara, Turkey)|date=March 2011|volume=17|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.4261/1305-3825.DIR.3116-09.0|pmid=20677130|url=http://www.dirjournal.org/eng/makale/490/34/Full-Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Typically none is required, but they can be treated surgically if symptomatic.&lt;ref name=bhatt /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5652">'''Dr. Robert Kezaala''' is a [[medical doctor]], [[epidemiologist]], [[scholar]] and [[public health]] leader in the field of [[immunization]] and health emergencies. Currently he is serving as a Senior Health Advisor and team lead for Accelerated Immunization Initiatives: measles, rubella, epidemic meningitis and yellow fever control and Immunization in Emergencies at the [[United Nations Children’s Fund]].

==Education==
Dr. Kezaala received his medical degree from [[Makerere University]] in [[Kampala, Uganda]]. He also holds an MPH from the [[Royal Tropical Institute]] (KIT) in Amsterdam, Netherlands majoring in epidemiology and health planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/rubella/mri_annual-report_2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative : Annual Report 2013 |website=Who.int |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dr. Kezaala has over 30 years of professional experience in public health including 24 years at international level. In the late 1980s, Dr. Kezaala practiced as Medical Officer in Karamoja province in the northeast of [[Uganda]] with recognized work in immunization and Tuberculosis control. From 1992 to 1993, Dr Kezaala worked with UNDP in multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS control where he managed the collaborative program that supported Uganda government efforts to address the AIDS epidemic. Thereafter, until 1998, he worked with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as Regional Health Delegate for Eastern and Southern Africa, managing a variety of health interventions including HIV/AIDS control, community water and sanitation  and refugee health and emergency response when he led IFRC's initial health response in Goma during the 1994 Rwanda crisis. Subsequently, he joined the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), where he worked for 14 years, first as epidemiologist and Team Lead for WHO-EPI in [[Ethiopia]]. From 2001 to 2005, Dr. Kezaala headed Measles Control for the Africa Region of WHO, when the Africa region registered a reduction in measles mortality by 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://measlesrubellainitiative.org/introducing-robert-kezaala-head-of-measles-rubella-unicef/ |title=Introducing Robert Kezaala, Head of Measles &amp; Rubella, UNICEF - Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative |website=Measlesrubellainitiative.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61663-8/fulltext?rss=yes|format=PDF||title=Reducing the global burden of congenital rubella syndrome|accessdate=2017-02-24|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61663-8|volume=380|journal=The Lancet|pages=1145–1146}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the next seven years serving as a medical officer with the Polio Eradication Initiative at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. While here, he worked in country support across the globe, including Chad, Pakistan, the Horn of Africa and served as the outbreak response manager for the 2010 Polio outbreak that affected Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Russia. During the stint in GPEI, Dr Kezaala developed the Short Interval Additional Dose (SIAD) tactical approach that has since become a standard for Polio outbreak response. In 2012, Dr Kezaala served as WHO liaison officer to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in setting up the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) for CDC's global Polio Eradication Initiative. Since June 2012, Dr Kezaala has served as Senior Health Advisor at the UNICEF headquarters in New York in charge of the Accelerated Immunization Initiatives - responsible for Measles and Rubella control, Yellow Fever, epidemic Meningitis and immunization in emergency settings. In 2016, he was instrumental as liaison officer to WHO in the response to the central Africa Yellow Fever outbreak that affected Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

Numerous news outlets and reports such as U.S. News, CNN, TV2Africa, allAfrica have quoted Dr. Kezaala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Park |first=Madison |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/06/health/measles-worldwide/ |title=How bad is measles around the world? |website=CNN.com |date=2015-02-06 |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX3bV7Li1zg |title=Measles Outbreak |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/media/media_65821.html |title=Eighty-six percent decline in measles cases brings Western Pacific Region closer than ever to measles elimination &amp;#124; Press centre |publisher=UNICEF |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a thought leader in topics related to public health, vaccines, health diplomacy and on Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200710080129.html|title=Uganda: Mediocrity Haunts Us|website=Allafrica.com|accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170202033758/https://reader.exacteditions.com/issues/3536/page/4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Entrepreneurs%3A+the+new+global+citizens.-a0160752368 |title=Entrepreneurs: the new global citizens |website=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200607250811.html|title=Uganda: Looking Into the Movement And the Future of the State - Part Two|website=Allafrica.com|accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Sertoli cell nodule''', also '''Pick's adenoma''',  '''testicular tubular adenoma''' and '''[[tubular adenoma]] of the [[testis]]''', is a [[benign]] [[hyperplasia|proliferation]] of [[Sertoli cell]]s that arises in association with [[cryptorchidism]] (undescended testis).  They are not composed of a clonal cell population, i.e. [[w:neoplasm|neoplastic]]; thus, technically, they should not be called an ''[[w:adenoma|adenoma]]''.&lt;ref name=tadrous&gt;{{cite book |title=Diagnostic criteria handbook in histopathology: a surgical pathology vade mecum |last=Tadrous |first=Paul J. |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Canada Ltd. |location= |isbn=978-0-470-51903-5 |page=227 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Before the 1992 implementation of the [[Medicare fee schedule]], physician payments were made under the "[[usual, customary and reasonable]]" payment model (a "charge-based" payment system). Physician services were largely considered to be misvalued under this system, with evaluation and management services being undervalued and procedures overvalued.&lt;ref name="MPP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Report to the Congress: Medicare Payment Policy |url=http://www.medpac.gov/documents/Mar06_EntireReport.pdf |work=[[Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]] |page=137 |date=March 2006 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party payers (public and private health insurance) advocated an improved model to replace the UCR fees, which had been associated with stark examples of [[Specialty (medicine)|specialist]]s making significantly higher sums of money than [[primary care physician]]s.&lt;ref name="Better"&gt;{{cite book |title=Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance |last=Gawande |first=Atul |authorlink=Atul Gawande |year=2007 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |isbn=0-312-42765-4 |page=115 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EUba-LKZ04C&amp;pg=PT83&amp;dq=in+the+mid-eighties,+doctors+who+spent+an+hour+making+a+complex+and+lifesaving+diagnosis+were+paid+forty+dollars&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M047TsqOF-fk0QHzxo2zCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20the%20mid-eighties%2C%20doctors%20who%20spent%20an%20hour%20making%20a%20complex%20and%20lifesaving%20diagnosis%20were%20paid%20forty%20dollars&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the research of [[William Hsiao]] and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[William Hsiao|Hsiao WC]], Braun P, Yntema D, Becker ER |title=Estimating physicians' work for a resource-based relative-value scale |journal=[[N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=319 |issue=13 |pages=835–41 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3412414 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198809293191305}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989]] was passed with the legislative intent of reducing the payment disparity between primary care and other specialties through use of the [[resource-based relative value scale]] (RBRVS). Beginning in 2000, all three components of the Medicare RBRVS, physician work, practice expense and malpractice expense are resource-based as required by Section 1848(c) of the Social Security Act.

RUC was established in 1991 by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[medical specialist]] groups.&lt;ref name="PrescribesFees"&gt;{{cite news |title=Physician Panel Prescribes the Fees Paid by Medicare |author1=Anna Wilde Mathews |author2=Tom McGinty |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 26, 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704657304575540440173772102 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMA sponsors RUC "both as an exercise of 'its First Amendment rights to petition the Federal Government' and for 'monitoring economic trends ... related to the CPT [Current Procedures and Terminology] development process".&lt;ref name="Unintended"/&gt;

RUC is highly influential because it ''de facto'' sets Medicare valuations of physician work [[relative value units]] (RVUs)&lt;ref name="LittleKnown"/&gt; of [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT) codes.&lt;ref name="Every"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Moore KJ, Felger TA, Larimore WL, Mills TL | title=What every physician should know about the RUC | journal=[[Fam Pract Manag]] |date=February 2008 | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 36–9 | pmid=18303653 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0200/p36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) is the ''de jure'' work RVU determining body.) On average, physician work RVUs make up slightly more than half of the value in a Medicare payment.&lt;ref name="Unintended"/&gt; Historically, CMS has accepted RUC recommendations more than 90% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;see http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/5/965&lt;/ref&gt; Health economist [[Uwe Reinhardt]] characterized the CMS as slavishly accepting RUC recommendations.&lt;ref name="LittleKnown"/&gt; The physician work RVU values accepted by CMS also influence private [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] reimbursement.&lt;ref name="Unintended"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Goodson JD| title=Unintended consequences of resource-based relative value scale reimbursement | journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | date= November 21, 2007 | volume= 298 | issue= 19 | pages= 2308–10 | pmid=18029836 | doi=10.1001/jama.298.19.2308 | url = https://www.sgim.org/userfiles/file/RVU%20article%20from%20JAMA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a RUC update of values raised concerns that the process, which was initiated by medical speciality groups, unfairly cut [[primary care physician]] pay.&lt;ref name="Rapidly"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ginsburg PB| title=Rapidly evolving physician-payment policy — more than the SGR | journal=[[N Engl J Med]] | year= 2011 | volume= 364 | issue= 2 | pages= 172–6 | pmid=21142529 | doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr1004028 | url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMhpr1004028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]'' publication written before the major health care reform legislation passed Congress—the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA)—Federman ''et al''. wrote:

{{quote|Physician dissatisfaction with Medicare reimbursements and concerns about equity of reimbursements suggest that the role of the RUC in advising Medicare should be carefully evaluated. The Obama administration and health policy experts have called for the creation of an independent Medicare advisory committee ... Without an independent arbiter, physicians and physician groups are likely to continue having complaints about the equitability of reimbursements under Medicare.&lt;ref name="PhysOpin"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Federman AD, Woodward M, Keyhani S | title=Physicians' opinions about reforming reimbursement: results of a national survey | journal=[[Arch Intern Med]] | year= 2010 | volume= 170 | issue= 19 | pages= 1735–42 | pmid=20975020 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2010.369}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics have pointed out that many RUC members may have significant conflicts of interest because of their financial relationships.&lt;ref name="careandcost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careandcost.com/2011/04/28/conflicts-of-interests-among-the-rucs-members/|title=Conflicts of Interests Among The RUC's Members|date=28 April 2011|website=careandcost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a report in the Washington ''Post'' highlighted how time seemed to bend in the system of time values assigned to various procedures. A Florida practice performing an average twelve colonoscopies and four other procedures a day in 2012 would be considered to take the physically impossible 26 hours in a nine- to 10-hour day. In other examples: In Florida and Pennsylvania surgery centers in some specialties, "more than one in five doctors would have to have been working more than 12 hours on average on a single day — much longer than the 10 hours or so a typical surgery center is open"; and "Florida records show 78 doctors — gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons and others — who performed at least 24 hours worth of procedures on an average workday". RUC chairperson Levy said in the report, "None of us believe the numbers are fine-tuned.... We do believe we get them right with respect to each other" while emphasizing that the "voting people around that table can be really harsh". Researcher Hsiao of the original Harvard study said the "current set of values 'seems to be distorted.... The AMA fought very hard to take over this updating process. I said this had to be done by an impartial group of people. This is highly political'". Looking at the time between 2003 and 2013, "the AMA and Medicare have increased the work values for 68 percent of the 5,700 codes analyzed by The Post, while decreasing them for only 10 percent" and while technology is argued, again with colonoscopies as an example, to be reducing actual time spent. Looked at another way, "Medicare spending on physician fees per patient grew 58 percent between 2001 and 2011, mostly because doctors increased the number of procedures performed but also because the price of those procedures rose". Finally, there was an indication in the report that the acceptance rate of the AMA's values by Medicare "has fallen in recent years from 90 percent [or higher] to about 70 percent" but the federal agency has far fewer people &amp;ndash; "six to eight" &amp;ndash; monitoring the process than the AMA has operating it.&lt;ref&gt;Whoriskey, Peter, and Dan Keating, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-a-secretive-panel-uses-data-that-distorts-doctors-pay/2013/07/20/ee134e3a-eda8-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html?tid=pm_pop "2How a secretive panel uses data that distort doctors’ pay"], Washington ''Post'', July 20, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RUC bears the brunt of the inherent problems with regulation and government price-setting. In a follow-up to The Washington Post report, Bloomberg notes: "There is no system of payment-setting that will not ultimately rely on information from self-interested parties, just as there is no system of financial regulation that can be designed without talking to bankers, or a system of education reform that can be put in place without asking teachers and principals how things work now." &lt;ref&gt;McArdle, Meagan, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-29/who-should-set-medicare-prices-.html] "Who Should Set Medicare Prices?" Bloomberg, July 29, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Payment Advisory Board]] passed in the PPACA. It could bypass RUC to cut payments to relatively highly compensated specialists, such as [[dermatologist]]s.&lt;ref name="LittleKnown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Most health industry players would win under overhaul |author=Phil Galewitz |newspaper=[[Kaiser Health News]] |publisher=[[McClatchy Washington DC News Bureau]] |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/08/16/73802/most-health-industry-players-would.html |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ilya Petrou |date=March 2010 |title=Examining healthcare reform |journal=[[Dermatology Times]] |publisher= |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=3–5 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Jesitus |date=April 2010 |title=Battling back |journal=Dermatology Times |publisher= |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=1, 26 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Jesitus |year=2010 |title=Weighing the impact |journal=Dermatology Times |publisher= |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=1, 22, 25–6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4143">The '''teach-back method''', also called the '''"show-me" method''', is a communication confirmation method used by healthcare providers to confirm whether a patient (or care takers) understands what is being explained to them. If a patient understands, they are able to "teach-back" the information accurately. This is a communication method intended to improve [[health literacy]].

There can be a significant gap in the perception of how much a patient needs information, or how effective a provider's communication is.&lt;ref name="In Focus"&gt;Teach Back: A tool for improving provider-patient communication. The Ethics Center. 2006. Retrieved from http://www.ethics.va.gov/docs/infocus/InFocus_20060401_Teach_Back.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can be due to various reasons such as a patient not understanding medical terminology, not feeling comfortable asking questions or even cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Not only does the teach-back method help providers understand the patient's needs in understanding their care, it also allows providers to evaluate their communication skills.&lt;ref name="In Focus" /&gt; Case studies led by the [[National Quality Forum]] on the informed consent processes of various hospitals found that those that effectively used the teach-back method benefited in areas of quality, patient safety, risk management and cost/efficiency.&lt;ref name="NQF"&gt;Implementing a National Voluntary Consensus Standard for Informed Consent: A User's Guide for Healthcare Professionals. National Quality Forum. 2005. Retrieved from http://www.qualityforum.org/Publications/2005/09/Implementing_a_National_Voluntary_Consensus_Standard_for_Informed_Consent__A_User’s_Guide_for_Healthcare_Professionals.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== The method ==
The [[National Quality Forum]] describes the practice as follows:&lt;ref name="NQF"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Who''' should use the method→ Any healthcare providers. E.g. physicians, nurses, healthcare professionals&lt;br /&gt;
'''What''' should patients teach-back→Information about their diagnosis, treatment plan, medications, risks and benefit of treatment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
'''When''' to ask for teach-back→ Early in the care process&lt;br /&gt;
'''Why''' is it important→Many patients have difficulty understanding medical information.&lt;br /&gt;
'''How'''→When asked to teach-back, patients should be able to clearly describe or explain the information provided to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the patient's successful or unsuccessful teach-back, the provider will clarify or modify the information and reassess the teach-back to confirm the patient's comprehension and understanding.&lt;ref name="Heiges"&gt;The Teach Back Method. SurroundHealth. 2012. Retrieved from www.surroundhealth.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge retention ==
The cycle of reassessing and teaching back to confirm comprehension has been found to improve knowledge retention and lower readmission rates in heart failure patients.&lt;ref name="White, Garbez, Carroll, Brinker &amp; Howie-Esquivel"&gt;Is "teach back" associated with knowledge retention and [[Hospital Readmission|hospital readmission]] in hospitalized heart failure patients? The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing. 2013 Mar-Apr;28(2):137-46. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0b013e31824987bd&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond healthcare literacy, the teach-back method can be utilized in academic and professional settings as well. Teachers often create [[feedback loops]]  in which the instructor asks the student to share what they heard, and promote peer to peer coaching  where students explain what they just learned to other students. Retention is also most positively impacted in [[participatory learning]] environments, when students participate in group discussions, practice by doing, and teaching others.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Teaching Methods and Retention. 2002. Retrieved from http://www.simulations.co.uk/pyramid.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilton Humanitarian Prize, World's Largest Humanitarian Award |website=Christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force was selected by a panel of independent international jurors for having made "contributions to improving the health of people living in extreme poverty.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2016/08/09/task-force-for-global-health-wins-2-million-hilton.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was co-founded by global health pioneer and former CDC Director, [[William Foege|Dr. William Foege]] and two of his former CDC colleagues, Carol Walters and Bill Watson. It was founded in 1984 as The Task Force for Child Survival.&lt;ref name="Foege"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foege |first=William |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-partners-in-fighting-disease/2012/11/22/f127b0e2-1f00-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_story.html |title=Global partners in fighting disease |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force was initially launched to foster collaboration among leading health and development agencies. Under the leadership of Dr. Foege, The Task Force brought together [[World Bank Group]], [[The Rockefeller Foundation]], [[United Nations Development Programme|The United Nations Development Programme]], [[WHO]], and [[UNICEF]], [[WHO]] to raise childhood immunization rates.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saportareport.com/task-force-global-health-receive-2016-2-million-prize-hilton-foundation/ |title=Task Force for Global Health to receive 2016 $2 million prize from Hilton Foundation |website=SaportaReport.com |date=2016-08-09 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, only 20 percent of children worldwide were receiving immunizations and 12,000 children, mostly in the world's poorest countries, were dying every day. By 1990, The Task Force had raised childhood immunization rates to 80 percent globally.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; Since then, The Task Force has used its strength and credibility in collaboration to positively affect a broad range of health issues affecting the world's poor.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; In 2015, The Task Force celebrated 30 years of contributions to global health at an event that included [[World Bank Group]] President [[Jim Yong Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadership.saportareport.com/globalhealth/2015/10/15/the-task-force-for-global-health-celebrates-30-years-of-contributions-to-global-health/ |title=Task Force for Global Health Celebrates 30 Years &amp;#124; Global Health |website=Leadership.saportareport.com |date=2015-10-15 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The Task Force works with hundreds of partners to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases and increase access to medicines and vaccines for [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[influenza]], and [[cholera]]. Beginning with the Mectizan Donation Program,&lt;ref name="Foege"/&gt; The Task Force is credited with working with the pharmaceutical industry to donate billions of dollars annually in essential medicines for the control and elimination of [[neglected tropical diseases]].&lt;ref name="globalatlanta1"/&gt;

Collaboration, health equity, and social justice are the cornerstones of all Task Force programs.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt; The organization is a major partner in the global effort to eliminate three neglected tropical diseases by 2025—blinding [[trachoma]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], and [[lymphatic filariasis]]—which collectively threaten hundreds of millions of people each year with blindness, disfigurement, and death.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt;

Information and laboratory technologies are vital tools in The Task Force's work to control and eliminate diseases and increase access to quality health care for people in developing countries.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpbnews.org/post/atlanta-considered-how-smartphones-and-science-could-help-eradicate-disease |title=Atlanta Considered: How Smartphones And Science Could Help Eradicate Disease &amp;#124; Georgia Public Broadcasting |website=Gpbnews.org |date=2016-02-26 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a smartphone-based data collection system, The Task Force maps the prevalence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) to determine where interventions should be implemented.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"/&gt; It uses portable molecular technology and tablet-based systems to detect and diagnose NTDs within populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wabe.org/post/closer-look-mayor-kasim-reed-santa-claus-and-more |title=Closer Look: Mayor Kasim Reed; Santa Claus; And More &amp;#124; WABE 90.1 FM |website=News.wabe.org |date=2015-12-16 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses diverse technologies to help developing countries manage their healthcare workforce in order to meet the health needs of their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2015/03/georgians-nation-stretch-health-resources/ |title=Georgians help a nation stretch its health resources |publisher=Georgia Health News |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, The Task Force's Public Health Informatics Institute was named a partner on a new Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation-funded initiative called the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance Program (CHAMPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://champshealth.org/|title=CHAMPS|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to understand and ultimately address the causes of death for children under 5 in developing countries.

In 2016, the Task Force helped launch a program called Digital Bridge which is developing an electronic case reporting system to improve information exchange between the public health and healthcare sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160827/MAGAZINE/308279979/commentary-stopping-zika-other-emerging-health-threats-requires|title=Commentary: Stopping Zika, other emerging health threats requires stronger surveillance systems|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and future==
In 2016, The Task Force reached an agreement to purchase a DeKalb County government building in downtown Decatur for a larger headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/global-health-organization-plans-expansion-dekalb/IJ3GYxKoKZg75q9EXc9L7I/|title=Task Force for Global Health may buy DeKalb government building|first=Mark|last=Niesse|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has begun examining how it might help address the growing epidemic of [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs) in developing countries.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5100">A '''uterine contraction''' is a [[muscle contraction]] of the [[uterine smooth muscle]].

==Throughout menstrual cycle==
The uterus frequently contracts throughout the entire [[menstrual cycle]], and these contractions have been termed ''endometrial waves'' or ''contractile waves''.&lt;ref name=aguilar2010&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq016 | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = S. | last3 = Knoll | first3 = A. H. | last4 = Yuan | first4 = X. | last1 = Aguilar | first1 = H. N. | title = Physiological pathways and molecular mechanisms regulating uterine contractility | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 725–744 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20551073}}&lt;/ref&gt; These appear to involve only the sub-[[endometrial]] layer of the [[myometrium]].&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt; In the early [[follicular phase]], these contractions occur once or twice per minute and last 10–15 seconds with a low amplitude of usually 30 mmHg.&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt; The frequency increases to 3–4 per minute towards [[ovulation]]. During the [[luteal phase]], the frequency and amplitude decrease, possibly to facilitate any [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].

If implantation does not occur, the frequency remains low, but the amplitude increases dramatically to between 50 and 200 mmHg producing labor-like contractions at the time of [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt; These contractions are sometimes termed ''menstrual cramps'',&lt;ref name=medicinenet&gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/page3.htm medicinenet.com &gt; Menstrual Cramps] Retrieved January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although that term is often used for [[menstrual pain]] in general. These contractions may be uncomfortable or even painful, but they are generally significantly less painful than contractions during labour. A hot water bottle or exercising has been found to help.{{Cn|date=December 2012}}

A shift in the myosin expression of the [[uterine smooth muscle]] has been hypothesized to avail for changes in the directions of uterine contractions that are seen during the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt;

==Childbirth==
[[File:Courtesy Bellyband with chip Shima Seiki Haute Technology Laboratory DSCF2178.jpg | thumb | right | Knitted Bellyband with conductive thread and RFID chip to monitor contractions]]
A contraction refers specifically to the motion of the [[uterus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Uterine+Contraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the process of [[childbirth]]. Contractions, and labour in general, is one condition that releases the hormone [[oxytocin]] into the body.  Contractions become longer as labour intensifies.

Prior to actual labour, women may experience [[Braxton Hicks contractions]], sometimes known as "false labour."

Since every [[pregnancy]] is different, a doctor, [[midwife]] or other competent professional should always be consulted before any action is taken to reduce the pain. Some popular methods may be harmful to the mother and/or the baby, or may actually worsen the pain or lengthen the labour.

Uterine contractions during childbirth can be [[monitoring (medicine)|monitored]] by [[cardiotocography]], in which a device is fixated to the skin of the mother or directly to the fetal scalp. The pressure required to flatten a section of the uterine wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.btconnect.com/MalcolmBrown/entries/TOCODYNAMOMETER.html Tocodynamometer]. By Dr. Malcolm C Brown. Copyright 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 

A type of monitoring technology under development at [[Drexel University]] embeds conductive threads in the knitted fabric of a bellyband. When the fibers stretch in response to a contraction, the threads function like an antenna, and send the signals they pick up to an embedded RFID (radio frequency identification device) chip that reports the data.&lt;ref name="Reyes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes|first1=Juliana|title=Drexel’s wearable-tech lab is making ‘a radio out of fabric’ for pregnant women|url=https://technical.ly/philly/2014/08/21/drexel-wearable-tech-pregnant-belly-band/|accessdate=10 May 2017|work=Technically Philly|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
