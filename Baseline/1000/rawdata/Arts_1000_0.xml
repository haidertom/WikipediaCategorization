      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">'''Added Art''' uses an existing piece of artwork for its canvas, just as traditional [[graffiti]] uses the wall of a building for the canvas. It is essentially the graffiti of artwork. Added Art is a merging of high and low art, using the concepts of graffiti, in a high art environment.  Adding to someone else’s work has been a very common occurrence in graffiti for decades. In the urban environment, it is typically considered aggressive or antagonistic in nature,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090412152743/http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2009/04/street-art-defacement-appropriate-media.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myballard.com/2009/07/06/vandals-deface-bergen-place-mural/|title=» Vandals deface Bergen Place mural|date=6 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also form of competition.

[[File:Apotropaic pentagram at Niemala.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Apotropaic marking on a farmhouse from Niemelä Tenant Farm, now exhibited at [[Seurasaari|Seurasaari Open Air Museum]] in [[Finland]]]]

'''Apotropaic marks''' are symbols or patterns scratched into the fabric of a building [[Apotropaic magic|to keep witches out]]. They are sometimes called witches' marks, a term also used to denote [[witches' mark|identifying marks once thought to be found on the bodies of witches]].

==Marks on buildings==
Apotropaic marks (from Greek ''apotrepein'' "to ward off" from ''apo-'' "away" and ''trepein'' "to turn") are symbols or patterns scratched into the fabric of a building with the intention of keeping witches out through [[apotropaic magic]].&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |title=Witches' marks: public asked to seek ancient scratchings in buildings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/31/witches-marks-historic-england-evil-spirits |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evil was thought to be held at bay through a wide variety of apotropaic objects such as [[amulet]]s and [[talisman]]s against the [[evil eye]]. Marks on buildings were one application of this type of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Asuni |first1=John |title=Apotropaic Talisman Against the “Evil Eye” |url=http://archaeologicalmuseum.jhu.edu/the-collection/object-stories/the-roman-house-at-hopkins/the-art-of-light/apotropaic-talisman-against-the-evil-eye/ |publisher=Johns Hopkins Archaeological Museum |accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks have been found at [[Shakespeare's Birthplace]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], at the [[Tower of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tower of London staff 'used magic to repel the forces of the Devil'|publisher=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/tower-of-london-staff-used-magic-to-repel-the-forces-of-the-devil-a6697476.html|accessdate=31 October 2016|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many churches, but little effort has been made to find them on secular buildings.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016/&gt; The marks are most common near places where witches were thought to be able to enter, whether doors, windows or chimneys.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016/&gt; For example, during works at [[Knole House]] in 1609, oak beams beneath floors, particularly near fireplaces, were scorched and carved with scratched witch marks to prevent witches and demons from coming down the chimney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=James|title= Ritual Protection Marks and Witchcraft at Knole, Kent |url=https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/ritual-protection-marks-and-witchcraft-at-knole-kent|publisher=[[Gresham College]] |date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/05/witch-marks-king-james-i-knole-sevenoaks-national-trust |title=Witch marks fit for a king beguile archaeologists at Knole |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2014-11-05 |accessdate=2014-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Witch marks, both scratched and in the form of chalk circles in front of fireplaces, are still made as a tradition, as found at [[The Fleece Inn]] in Worcestershire, England.{{cn|date=October 2016}}--&gt; At the [[Bradford-on-Avon Tithe Barn]], a [[overlapping circles grid|flower-like pattern of overlapping circles]] is incised into a stone in the wall.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016/&gt; Similar marks of overlapping circles have been found on a window cill dated about 1616 at [[Owlpen Manor]] in Gloucestershire.

Other types of mark include the intertwined letters V and M or a double V (for the protector, the [[Virgin Mary]], alias ''Virgo Virginum''), and crisscrossing lines to confuse any spirits that might try to follow them.&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here Be Witchcraft|url=http://www.lassco.co.uk/lassco-news/2013/10/29/here-be-witchcraft/|publisher=Lassco|accessdate=31 October 2016|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early '''architectural photographers''' include [[Roger Fenton]], [[Francis Frith]] (Middle East and Britain), [[Samuel Bourne]] (India) and [[Albert Levy (photographer)|Albert Levy]] (United States and Europe). They paved the way for the modern speciality of [[architectural photography]]. Later architectural photography had practitioners such as [[Ezra Stoller]] and [[Julius Shulman]]. Stoller worked mainly on the east coast of America, having graduated with a degree in architecture in the 1930s. Shulman, who was based on the West Coast, became an architectural photographer after some images that he had taken of one of [[Richard Neutra]]'s houses in California made their way onto the architect's desk.

{{Merge to|Cryptolect|discuss=Talk:Cant (language)#Merge to Cryptolect|date=September 2017}} 
An '''argot''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|ɑr|ɡ|oʊ}}; from [[French language|French]] ''argot'' {{IPAc-fr|a|r|ˈ|ɡ|o}} '[[slang]]') is a [[Cant (language)|secret language]] used by various groups—e.g., schoolmates, outlaws, colleagues, gay people ([[Polari]]) among many others—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term ''argot'' is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which [[word sense|sense]] it overlaps with [[jargon]]. The discipline of medicine has been referred to as having its own argot which includes abbreviations, acronyms, and "technical colloquialisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hukill|first=Peter B.|last2=H.|first2=A. L.|last3=Jackson|first3=James L.|date=1961|title=The Spoken Language of Medicine: Argot, Slang, Cant|jstor=453853|journal=American Speech|volume=36|issue=2|pages=145–151|doi=10.2307/453853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Victor Hugo]] was one of the first to research and compile terms from criminal argot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255/popcorn/convicts2.html | title=Interesting Facts about Convicts of France in the 19th Century | author=Schwartz, Robert M. |publisher=Mt. Holyoke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]],'' he refers to that argot as both "the language of the dark" and "the language of misery."

The earliest known record of the term ''argot'' in this context was in a 1628 document. The word was probably derived from the contemporary name ''les argotiers'', given to a group of thieves at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Guiraud, Pierre, ''L'Argot. Que sais-je?'', Paris: PUF, 1958, p. 700&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the strictest definition, an ''argot'' is a proper language with its own grammar and style. But such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Such argots are mainly versions of another language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; ''argot'' used in this [[word sense|sense]] is [[synonym]]ous with ''[[cant (language)|cant]]''. For example, ''argot'' in this sense is used for systems such as ''[[verlan]]'' and ''[[louchébem]]'', which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words).&lt;ref name="valdman"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Valdman
 | first = Albert
 | title = La Langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au français populaire
 | journal = The French Review
 | volume = 73

 | publisher = American Association of Teachers of French
 | date = May 2000
 | jstor = 399371|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems are examples of ''argots à clef'', or "coded argots."&lt;ref name="valdman"/&gt;

Specific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way. For example, modern [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:loufoque|loufoque]]'' 'crazy, goofy', now common usage, originates in the ''[[louchébem]]'' transformation of Fr. ''[[wikt:fou|fou]]'' 'crazy'.

"Piaf" is a Parisian argot word for "bird, [[sparrow]]". It was taken up by singer [[Edith Piaf]] as her stage name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/06/25/french-blues| title=French Blues| author=Judith Thurman| date=June 25, 2007| accessdate=May 5, 2015| publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1019">'''Artwork''' (also known as '''art layoutdrawing''') is a type of drawing that serves a graphical representation of an image for its reproduction onto a [[substrate (printing)|substrate]] via various processes, such as [[silkscreen]], label making and other printing methods. Transfer of the image often involves a photographic process.

Historically, some types of artworks were prepared on clear polyester [[drafting film]] or similar media for strength, durability and dimensional stability.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2008, "Undimensioned Drawings", [[ASME Y14.31-2008]], ¶4, "Drawings that require strength, durability, and dimensional stability shall be prepared on Class 1 polyester film..."&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern artwork may be stored electronically, such as those created in [[Adobe Illustrator Artwork|Adobe Illustrator file format (.ai)]].

==Arundel Club==
The '''Arundel Club''' was a society founded in London in 1904 for the purpose of continuing more effectively the work of the Arundel Society, which had encouraged the study of art by reproducing the best works of the old masters.  The Arundel Club went further by copying and publishing important works in private collections previously inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMaCnQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Arundel+Club&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiF4s6fxv_TAhVIOyYKHd_3ACYQ6AEIJzAA|title=The Arundel Club: For the Publication of Reproductions of Works of Art in Private Collections and Elsewhere|first=Arundel|last=Club|date=20 May 2017|publisher=J.J.

Conceptually, McLennan's work tends to be unambiguous and antagonistic from a left-wing perspective, loosely following the traditions of [[agitprop]], [[anti-art]] and [[Institutional Critique]], incorporating elements of [[détournement]], [[readymade]] or [[installation art|installation]]. His works have often been characterised as controversial by conservative politicians, journalists and art critics, usually portraying the artist in a negative light.&lt;ref name="The politics"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/13/1084289821310.html "The politics of art"] ''The Age,'' 14 May 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, various liberal lawyers, academics and activists have defended his works, usually on the basis of [[free speech]], due to the offence sometimes caused by his art for its often overt left-leaning bias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visualarts.net.au/files/NQ%20Dec%2008_fin.pdf "25 Years: NAVA at the forefront of Australia’s cultural policy agenda"] ''NAVA Quarterly''. December 2008. Accessed 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The artist has expressed public criticisms over [[Zionism]], the [[War on Terror]], [[Australian nationalism]] and racism, the [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention]] of [[asylum seekers]], various political figures and the [[managerial class]] of the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WhLNCpl6XgEJ:www.visualarts.net.au/files/Art_Censorship.pdf "Dealing With Art Censorship"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''National Association for the Visual Arts'' Media Release, 30 March 2009.

== Controversy ==

=== Victorian College of the Arts ===
In August 2003, McLennan hired a [[G4S|Group 4 Securicor]] guard to keep gallery punters out of an exhibition opening at the VCA. Group 4 run [[immigration detention]] centres in Australia, such as [[Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Baxter Detention Centre]] and the now closed [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Woomera Detention Centre]]. The security guard was reportedly humiliated due to the incident which occurred at a time of high criticism of the [[John Howard]] government's treatment of [[Refugee#Asylum seekers|asylum seekers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209182233/http://www.theage.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2003/09/03/1062548903857.html "VCA artwork raises ethics concerns"] ''The Age,'' 4 September 2003. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24seven ===
In May 2004, McLennan produced ''Fifty-six,'' an exhibition designed to coincide with [[Nakba Day]], the title drawing on the number of years since the establishment of [[Israel]]. The public exhibition in the shop front window space of 24seven Gallery on one of Melbourne CBD's busy streets, was censored by the [[City of Melbourne]] days after it was installed. The installation consisted of a large wall painting of an Israeli flag, with "debatable" statistics on the gallery's window about Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The scandal made international news, many pro-Israel individuals and groups accusing McLennan of [[antisemitism]]. This put a number of Victorian political figures such as former Premier [[Steve Bracks]], Lord Mayor [[John So]] and former City of Melbourne councillor Kimberly Kitching under pressure to respond. The use of taxpayer's money to fund the space fuelled a lot of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.discoverymedia.com.au/artzinePub/story.asp?id=375&amp;section=ExNews "Making Space – spanking the hand that feeds it"] ''Art Right Now,'' 16 June 2007. Accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan also deeply outraged some critics by insinuating that the [[Nazis]] had a similar position on what they termed [[degenerate art]]. McLennan maintains a strong criticism of Israeli policies.&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt;

=== Citylights ===
In August 2004, McLennan displayed ''State Sponsored'', a collection of portraits of [[Hamas]] militants, including [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] and [[Abdul Aziz Rantisi|Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi]] and the dates they were assassinated. The work was exhibited at Citylights project – a public art space in a Melbourne CBD lane way. McLennan was accused of glorifying terrorism by Ted Lapkin, a senior policy analyst of the [[Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council]]. Andrew Mac, Citylights' curator and director defended the work on the grounds of diversity of opinion stating the artist's use of "state sponsored" referred to [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Jewish-group-blasts-offensive-artwork/2004/12/10/1102625519852.html "Jewish group blasts 'offensive' artwork"] ''The Age,'' 10 December 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform Artists Group ===
In September 2005, the City of Melbourne intervened to terminate McLennan's ''Canberra's 18'' exhibition shortly before it was scheduled to be shown at the [[Platform artists group]]'s [[Artist-run initiative]] (ARI), Platform 2. The exhibition was to include images of the then 18 Islamic organisations proscribed as terrorists by the Australian Government and the basis for their formation. City of Melbourne Deputy Mayor [[Gary Singer]] claimed the proper guidelines were not followed. Human rights campaigner and barrister [[Julian Burnside]] claimed the censorship was about governments testing how much Australians would tolerate such occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/war-on-terrorism-is-claiming-victims-on-the-walls-of-art-galleries/2005/09/15/1126750082623.html "War on terrorism is claiming victims on the walls of art galleries"] ''Sydney Morning Herald,'' 16 September 2005. Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan accused City of Melbourne of political censorship and appeasing Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/09/14/1126377376345.html "City council bans 'terror artwork'"] ''The Age,'' 15 September 2005. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Singer's areas of special interests ironically include [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&amp;pa=1317&amp;pg=1996 "Deputy Lord Mayor Gary Singer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725155111/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&amp;pa=1317&amp;pg=1996 |date=25 July 2008 }} ''City of Melbourne,'' Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monash University ===
[[Monash University Art and Design Faculty]] in Melbourne withdrew McLennan's video ''Mind the Gap'' in October 2005, ironically made for the same exhibition Monash had agreed to show the censored ''Canberra's 18'' work. The video contained graphic footage of the [[beheading]] of British contractor [[Kenneth Bigley]] by [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Tawhid and Jihad]] in 2004. The video criticised former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] for his role in the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html "Azlan McLennan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520005543/http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html |date=20 May 2008 }} ''un Magazine,'' Volume 7, 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship is likely to have been motivated by the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005]], particularly the controversial return to the crime of [[sedition]] introduced by the Howard government some weeks later and passed into law the following month; a move highly unpopular amongst the arts sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 "Artists 'at risk' under terror laws"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627104653/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 |date=27 June 2006 }} ''NineMSN,'' 8 November 2005. Accessed 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Art ===
City of Melbourne and acting Transport Minister [[Bob Cameron (Victorian politician)|Bob Cameron]] censored ''Pay Your Way'' in January 2006 while McLennan was in residency in Indonesia. The posters – part of the Urbanart ARI program – were displayed in public tram shelters and pulled down only hours later due to complaints. The works featured images of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]], a Brazilian man shot dead by London police and accused Muslim terrorist, [[Joseph T. Thomas|Jack Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fare-game-shelters-feel-the-brush-of-protest/2006/01/09/1136771500463.html "Fare game! Shelters feel the brush of protest"] ''The Age,'' 10 January 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The works were characterised as racist and [[Islamophobic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,17795788-2862,00.html "My art is not racist"] ''Herald Sun,'' 12 January 2006. Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; yet McLennan claimed the works were satirising the post [[9-11]] racism and Islamophobia perpetuated by pro-US governments. McLennan is also a [[Muslim]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=266&amp;Itemid=106 "Political art meets a paranoid state"] ''Socialist Alternative,'' Edition 99, February 2006.

Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; yet weeks later would defend McLennan publicly against the [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]] police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/defiant-artist-flies-his-unaustralian-flag-again/2006/02/28/1141095741391.html "Defiant artist flies his 'UnAustralian' flag again"] ''The Age,'' 1 March 2006. Accessed 24 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trocadero Art Space ===
Only weeks after the ''Pay Your Way'' affair, McLennan's ''Proudly UnAustralian'' was removed by the [[Victoria Police]] in Melbourne. The exhibition – featuring a burnt Australian flag – took place at Trocadero Art Space who rents a public billboard to exhibiting artists. It was to coincide with the 2006 [[Australia Day]] in January. The work was removed some days prior this date and McLennan arrived back in Australia days later to a media furore. The scandal had been criticised as offensive by those such as Federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] MP [[Bronwyn Bishop]] who attempted to introduce a ban on [[Flag desecration|flag burning]], and the national president of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned and Services League]]. [[Free speech]] advocates such as the [[National Association for the Visual Arts]] and criminal defence lawyer Rob Stary denounced the police's actions as an attack on [[civil rights]]. This took place only a few short months after the [[2005 Cronulla riots]] and fuelled the broader debate about [[racism in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm "Art prompts call for flag-burning law change"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211040610/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm |date=11 February 2006 }} ''The 7.30 Report'' (Transcript), 6 February 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Centre for Contemporary Art ===
McLennan wrote an article in 2006 criticising the Artistic Director of the [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]] (ACCA), Juliana Engberg over her reaction to artist and VCA student, Ash Keating and his appropriation of ACCA's waste disposal for the use of his art. The Engberg/Keating scandal became widely known amongst Melbourne art circles from the ACCA exhibition opening where it took place and later through the independent electronic magazine [[Crikey]]. McLennan's polemic further fuelled debate over Engberg's credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/power-of-one/2006/08/31/1156817027357.html "Power of one"] ''The Age,'' 1 September 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anna Schwartz Gallery ===
McLennan featured in ''Rules of Engagement'' at Melbourne ARI West Space in May 2007, which dealt with "relationships, power and exchange within the art system" according to the show's curator Mark Feary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westspace.org.au/projects/rules-of-engagement.html?Itemid=0 "Rules of Engagement"] ''West Space'' (Catalogue Essay), May 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan's contribution, ''Art in a Capitalist Society'' depicted an authoritative picture of leading private Australian gallerist Anna Schwartz, linked to a quote about [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] from the [[Karl Marx]] treatise ''[[Das Kapital]]''. Schwartz has previously criticised McLennan&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt; and some have accused McLennan of taking revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/artists-dish-it-out-to-the-dealers/2007/06/14/1181414455138.html "Artists dish it out to the dealers"] ''The Age,'' 15 June 2007. Accessed 25 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Melbourne ===
In a July 2009, ''[[Farrago (newspaper)|Farrago]]'' interview, McLennan attacked the [[University of Melbourne]] over the merger with the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], the [[Melbourne Model]], the liquidation of the [[Victorian College of the Arts Student Union|VCA Student Union]] and likened the Vice-chancellor, [[Glyn Davis]]' perceived political censorship to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s use of [[Nazi art|Fascist Art]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s use of [[Socialist Realism]]. He also depicted Davis and the Provost, [[Peter McPhee (academic)|Peter McPhee]], as [[Sex Pistols]] musicians, [[Johnny Rotten]] and [[Sid Vicious]] in a parody of the [[Sex Pistols#Never Mind the Bollocks|Never Mind the Bollocks]] album cover as well as depicting Davis as the violent [[psychopath]], [[Alex DeLarge]] in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film adaptation of [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;"Report on the death of the VCA" ''Farrago,'' Edition 5, July 2009, p. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan had previously attacked Davis and the university administration as the former General Secretary of the VCA Student Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1659&amp;Itemid=106 Smashing jobs, courses and student unions: A 2020 vision?] ''Socialist Alternative,'' Edition 128, May 2008.

{{wiktionary|camaieu}}
'''Camaïeu''' (also called ''en camaïeu'') is a technique that employs two or three [[tint]]s of a single [[color]], other than gray, to create a [[monochromatic]] image without regard to local or realistic color. When a picture is monochromatically rendered in gray, it is called [[grisaille]]; when in yellow, [[cirage]].{{ref|reference1}}

The term is also applied to monochrome painting in enamels. This technique uses a buildup of white enamel to create highlights and light areas. However, instead of using a black background, as in grisaille, transparent enamel is laid in first, beneath the whites. This technique is frequently used on [[snuffbox]]es, watches and medallions.

''{{lang|fr|Camaïeu}}'' can also refer, following the French usage, to [[chiaroscuro]] [[woodcut]] [[old master print|prints]] that imitate highlighted drawing on tinted paper. However, the correct term in English for these is ''chiaroscuro woodcuts''.

This French word once was synonymous with ''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'', but its meaning became restricted in the early eighteenth century.{{ref|reference2}}

Camaïeu is also a registered trademark of a manufacturer.

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''
*[[Drake Mallard|Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard]] has a big ego. ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''
*[[Peter Griffin]] is extremely impulsive and causes many problems for his family and friends: ''[[Family Guy]]''
*[[Zuko]] makes misguided decisions in an effort to gain his cruel father's acceptance: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1187">'''Chromolithe''' ("light from stone") is a [[light art]] that gives the impression that the buildings have been painted with glowing colours. 
Chromolithe installations have been made for cathedrals and churches, historic public buildings, modern art museums, and even banks.

The chromolithe process starts with data collection, using a specially-built photographic chamber, months of meticulous art work on computer screens, and finally re-projecting the image, printed to 24x24 cm photographic plates, back onto the building from a series of custom-built 6000Kva [[Xenon]] projectors, discreetly placed, so as to make the light source appear invisible. 

Some of the cathedrals and intricate sculptured Gothic buildings that have been chromolithed, were originally painted. Thus, work like that of [[Patrice Warrener]]'s can be seen as a restoration of heritage buildings.

'''Commercial art''' is the art of [[creative services]], referring to [[art]] created for [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes, primarily [[advertising]]. Commercial art uses a variety of platforms (magazines, websites, apps, television, etc.) for viewers with the intent of promoting sale and interest of products, services, and ideas.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/commercial_art.html|title=What is Commercial Art?|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on the iconic image (pictorial representations that are recognized easily to members of a culture) to enhance recall and favorable recognition for a product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/879527515|title=Persuasion and influence in American life|last=C.|first=Woodward, Gary|others=Denton, Robert E., Jr.|isbn=9781478607892|edition= Seventh |location=Long Grove, Illinois|oclc=879527515}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a product could be a magazine ad promoting a new soda through complimentary colors, a catchy message, and appealing illustrative features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/articles/Commercial_Art_Professions_Job_Description_and_Information_About_Starting_a_Career_as_a_Commercial_Artist_or_Commercial_Designer.html|title=Commercial Artist: Job Description &amp; Career Information|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could be promoting the prevention of global warming by encouraging people to walk or ride a bike instead of driving in an eye catching poster. It communicates something specific to an audience.

People can obtain training, certifications, and degrees that incorporate commercial arts in many exercises, activities, and programs.

==Skills of Commercial Art==

* Attention to detail
* Ability to communicate effectively
* Experience or skills in the fine arts (drawing, painting, photography, etc.)
* Knowledgeable of certain computer software programs (graphics, editing, etc.) and ability to use them
* [[Marketing]] skills
* [[Advertising]] skills

== [[Consumerism]] within Commercial Art ==
Commercial art is art that is created for commercial purposes to promote services, products, and ideas to viewers.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com2" /&gt; In the process of creating commercial art, an audience is taken into consideration when designing and/or forming the goods that are being advertised/promoted. An example of this can be seen in the recognized works of American painter and consumer ad designer, [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-warhol-andy-artworks.htm#pnt_1|title=Andy Warhol Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell]]'s soup and [[Coca-Cola]] bottles as everyday products of consumers, he recreated a visually stimulating design through [[pop art]] that advertises the products through consumption habits of consumers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Consumerism]] was present when [[pop art]] was popular.

'''Contour rivalry''' is an artistic technique used to create multiple possible visual interpretations of an image. An image may be viewed as depicting one thing when viewed in a certain way; but if the image is flipped or turned, the same lines that formed the previous image now make up an entirely new design.

[[File:A detail of the Raimondi Stela.png|thumb|250px|A detail of the Raimondi Stela, an example of contour rivalry produced by the Chavin culture.]]
This technique was widely practiced by the artists of the [[Chavín culture]] of the central [[Andes]] about two thousand years ago. An example of this technique from the Chavín is the [[Raimondi Stela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heritage-key.com/category/tags/contour-rivalry |title=Contour rivalry, Raimondi Stela |accessdate=2009-09-06 |publisher=Heritage Key}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crucifixions and crucifixes''' have appeared in [[the arts]] and [[popular culture]] from before the era of the pagan [[Roman Empire]]. The [[crucifixion of Jesus]] has been depicted in [[religious art]] since the 4th century [[Common Era|CE]]. In more modern times, [[crucifixion]] has appeared in film and television as well as in fine art, and depictions of other historical crucifixions have appeared as well as the crucifixion of Christ. Modern art and culture have also seen the rise of images of crucifixion being used to make statements unconnected with [[Iconography#Christian iconography|Christian iconography]], or even just used for shock value.

In the first three centuries of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian art]], the crucifixion was rarely depicted. Some [[engraved gem]]s thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and it is thought that at this period the image was restricted to [[heresy|heretical]] groups of Christians. The earliest Western images clearly originating in the mainstream of the church are 5th-century, including the scene on the doors of [[Santa Sabina]], Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–91, fig. 321&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] forbade crucifixion as a method of execution, and early church leaders regarded crucifixion with horror, and thus, as an unfit subject for artistic portrayal.&lt;ref name=Dreyer&gt;Elizabeth A. Dreyer, ''The Cross in Christian Tradition: From Paul to Bonaventure'', Paulist Press, 2001, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purported discovery of the [[True Cross]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], and the development of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] as a site for [[pilgrimage]], together with the dispersal of fragments of the [[relic]] across the Christian world, led to a change of attitude.  It was probably in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the [[Monza ampullae]], small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the [[Holy Land]], as well as 5th-century [[ivory]] [[relief]]s from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 89–90, figs. 322–326&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Middle Ages]], early Christians preferred to focus on the "triumphant" Christ, rather than a dying one, because the concept of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|risen Christ]] was so central to their faith.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3728859|title=Donne and the Crucifixion|first=Julia J.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1984|publisher=|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=79|issue=3|pages=513–525|doi=10.2307/3728859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plain cross became depicted, often as a "glorified" symbol, as the [[crux gemmata]], covered with jewels, as many real early medieval [[processional cross]]es in goldsmith work were.

=== Eastern church ===
[[File:Meister des Rabula-Evangeliums 002.jpg|thumb|250px|The earliest crucifixion in an [[illuminated manuscript]], from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], 586 CE]]
Early depictions showed a living Christ, and tended to minimize the appearance of suffering, so as to draw attention to the positive message of resurrection and faith, rather than to the physical realities of execution.&lt;ref name=Dreyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Kevin Seasoltz ,''A Sense Of The Sacred: Theological Foundations Of Christian Architecture And Art'', 2005, Continuum International Publishing Group, pp. 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early history of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|church in Ireland]], important events were often commemorated by erecting pillars with elaborate crucifixes carved into them, such as where [[Saint Patrick]], returning as a missionary bishop, saw the place he was held captive in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j7yFjie05bcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=life+of+saint+columba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEvvnbkZLNAhUE44MKHQECA3oQ6AEIFDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Patrick&amp;f=false Life of St Columba], Penguin books, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Byzantine depictions such as that in the [[Rabbula Gospels]] often show Christ flanked by [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]] and [[Stephaton]] with their spear and pole with vinegar. According to the gospels, the vinegar was offered just before Christ died, and the lance used just after, so the presence of the two flanking figures symbolizes the "double reality of God and man in Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93&lt;/ref&gt; In images from after the end of the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], Christ is shown as dead, but his "body is undamaged and there is no expression of pain"; the Eastern church held that Christ's body was invulnerable. The "S"-shaped slumped body type was developed in the 11th century. These images were one of the complaints against Constantinople given by Rome in the [[Great Schism of 1054]], although the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne]] is probably nearly a century older.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western church ===
[[File:Cimabue 025.jpg|right|thumb|[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Santa Croce Crucifix]], {{convert|448|x|390|cm|1|abbr=on}}, by [[Cimabue]], [[Florence]], 1287–1288]]
The earliest Western images of a dead Christ may be in the [[Utrecht Psalter]], probably before 835.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 99 quoted, 94–99, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early Western examples include the [[Gero Cross]] and the reverse of the [[Cross of Lothair]], both from the end of the 10th century. The first of these is the earliest near life-size sculpted cross to survive, and in its large scale represents "suffering in its extreme physical consequences", a trend that was to continue in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 141 quoted, 105–106, 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Such figures, especially as [[rood]]s, large painted or sculpted crucifixes hung high in front of the [[chancel]] of churches, became very important in Western art, providing a sharp contrast with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] traditions, where the subject was never depicted in [[monumental sculpture]], and increasingly rarely even in small Byzantine ivories. By contrast, an [[Altar crucifix|altar cross]], almost always a [[crucifix]], became compulsory in Western churches in the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;That it should be a crucifix was first specified in the [[Roman Missal]] of 1570&lt;/ref&gt; and small wall-mounted crucifixes were increasingly popular in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] homes from the [[Counter-Reformation]], if not before.

As a broad generalization, the earliest depictions, before about 900, tended to show all three crosses (those of Jesus, the [[Penitent thief|Good Thief]] and the [[Impenitent thief|Bad Thief]]), but later medieval depictions mostly showed just Jesus and his cross. From the Renaissance either type might be shown. The number of other figures shown depended on the size and medium of the work, but there was a similar trend for early depictions to show a number of figures, giving way in the [[High Middle Ages]] to just the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]], shown standing on either side of the cross, as in the [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]] depictions, or sculpted or painted on panels at the end of each arm of a rood cross.

The soldiers were less likely to be shown, but others of the party with Mary and John might be. Angels were often shown in the sky, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] in some early depictions gave way to a small figure of [[God the Father]] in the heavens in some later ones, those these were always in the minority. Other elements that might be included were the sun and moon (evoking the [[Crucifixion darkness|darkening of the heavens]] at the moment of Christ’s death), and [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]]. Although according to the Gospel accounts his clothing was removed from Jesus before his crucifixion, most artists have thought it proper to represent his lower body as draped in some way. In one type of sculpted crucifix, of which the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Volto Santo in Lucca]] is the classic example, Christ continued to wear the long ''collobium'' robe of the Rabbula Gospels.
[[File:Giotto di bondone e collaboratore napoletano, crocifissione, 1328-1332 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|left|A crowded Gothic narrative treatment, workshop of [[Giotto]], c. 1330]]

In the Gothic period more elaborate narrative depictions developed, including many extra figures of [[Mary Magdalene]], disciples, especially [[The Three Marys]] behind the Virgin Mary, soldiers often including an officer on a horse, and angels in the sky. The moment when [[Saint Longinus|Longinus the centurion]] pierces Christ with his spear (the "[[Holy Lance]]") is often shown, and the blood and water spurting from Christ's side is often caught in a chalice held by an angel. In larger images the other two crosses might return, but most often not. In some works [[donor portrait]]s were included in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–158&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions begin in the late 12th century, and become common where space allows in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Related scenes such as the ''[[Descent from the Cross|Deposition of Christ]]'', ''[[Entombment of Christ]]'' and ''Nailing of Christ to the Cross'' developed.  In the Late Middle Ages, increasingly intense and realistic representations of suffering were shown,&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'', 1987, Greenwood Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the development of highly emotional [[andachtsbilder]] subjects and devotional trends such as [[German mysticism]]; some, like the [[Trinity#The Trinity in art|Throne of Mercy]], [[Man of Sorrows]] and [[Pietà]], related to the Crucifixion.  The same trend affected the depiction of other figures, notably in the "[[Swoon of the Virgin]]", who is very commonly shown fainting in paintings of between 1300 and 1500, though this depiction was attacked by theologians in the 16th century, and became unusual.  After typically more tranquil depictions during the [[Italian Renaissance]]—though not its [[Northern Renaissance|Northern equivalent]], which produced works such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]—there was a return to intense emotionalism in the [[Baroque]], in works such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]]'s [[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|''Elevation of the Cross'']].

The scene always formed part of a cycle of images of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' after about 600 (though it is noticeably absent before) and usually in one of the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]''; the presence of Saint John made it a common subject for altarpieces in churches dedicated to him. From the late Middle Ages various new contexts for images were devised, from such large scale monuments as the [[Calvary (sculpture)|"calvaire"]] of [[Brittany]] and the [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] to the thousands of small [[wayside shrine]]s still found in many parts of Catholic Europe, and the [[Stations of the Cross]] in the majority of Catholic churches.

=== Popular art ===
Crucifixion in popular art, as with modern art, is sometimes used for its shock value. For example, a World War I [[Liberty bond]] poster by [[Fernando Amorsolo]] depicts a German soldier nailing an American soldier, his arms outspread, to the trunk of a tree. Crucifixion imagery is also used to make points in [[editorial cartoon|political cartoons]].

After all, the way it's generally used in anime—when it's used at all—is in a manner Westerners can understand. It becomes a form of torture ''for someone who doesn't deserve it.''"({{Harvnb|Drazen|2003|pp=142–43}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Passion plays ==
[[File:PassionPlay.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A passion play, Poland, 2006]]
{{Main|Passion play}}
Passion plays are dramatic presentations of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. They originated as expressions of devotion in the [[Middle Ages]]. In modern times, critics have said that some performances are [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/ "In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television ==

=== Film ===
Numerous movies have been produced which depict the crucifixion of Jesus. Some of these movies depict the crucifixion in its traditional sectarian form, while others intend to show a more historically accurate account. For example, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), was probably the first movie to depict the nails being driven through Jesus' wrists, rather than his palms. [[Mel Gibson]]'s controversial ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) depicted an extreme level of violence, but showed the nails being driven into Jesus' palms, as is traditional, with ropes supporting the wrists.

Although crucifixion imagery is common, few films depict actual crucifixion outside of a Christian context. ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) depicts the mass crucifixions of rebellious slaves along the [[Appian Way]] after the [[Third Servile War]]. The character Big Bob is crucified by cannibals in [[Wes Craven]]'s horror exploitation film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) as well as [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|its 2006 remake]]. ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) depicts [[Conan the Barbarian|the protagonist]] being crucified on the Tree of Woe.

The 1979 British comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' ends with a comical sequence in which several of the cast, including Brian, are crucified by the Romans. The film ends with them all singing the song "[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]". In this sequence, the characters are not nailed to the crosses, but tied at the wrists to the crossbar, and are standing on smaller crosspieces at foot level.

In the 2010 film [[Legion (2010 film)#Plot|''Legion'']], one of the diner patrons is found crucified upside down and covered with huge boils.

=== Television ===
Simulated crucifixions have been performed in [[professional wrestling]]. On the December 7, 1998, edition of ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'', professional wrestling character [[The Undertaker]] crucified [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/11494884@N02/1382011485/|title=Stone Cold gets crucified by Undertaker on Taker's symbol|work=flickr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 1996, in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], during a feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], instructed his [[Raven's Nest]] to crucify Sandman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlinggonewrong.com/video/sandman_crucifixion.html|title=Wrestlinggonewrong.com|work=wrestlinggonewrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other television performers have used crucifixion to make a point. The [[Australians|Australian]] [[comedian]] [[John Safran]] had himself crucified in the [[Philippines]] as part of a [[Good Friday]] [[Crucifixion#As a devotional practice|crucifixion ritual]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] show, ''[[John Safran's Race Relations]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/safran-crucifixion-disrespectful-immoral/story-e6frfkp9-1225699011366, Philippines villagers bewildered by John Safran comedy stunt]&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Robbie Williams]] performed a stunt on an April 2006 [[Easter]] Sunday show shown on the UK television channel [[Channel 4]], in which he was affixed to a cross and pierced with needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywood.premiere.com/news/music/story/church_slams_williams_crucifixion_stunt/|title=Church Slams Williams Crucifixion Stunt|work=premiere.com}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HBO]] television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' (2005–2007) contained several depictions of crucifixion, as it was a common torture method during the historical period the show takes place in.

In the 2010 ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'' television series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'', Segovax, a slave recruit to the gladiatorial [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]] of Lentulus Batiatus, attempts to assassinate Spartacus in the ludus washrooms and is crucified for doing so "after being parted from his cock".

Crucifixion has been depicted in the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (1995–2001), where its depiction has been cited in feminist studies as illustrating violent and misogynist tendencies within a messianic paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Kathleen|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14680770701477966|title=Xena On The Cross|journal=Feminist Media Studies|accessdate=December 12, 2011|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3|pages=313–332|doi=10.1080/14680770701477966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] series "Vikings", the character Æthelstan, after being captured by the Saxons and named an apostate, is shown wearing a crown of thorns and being nailed to a cross. After the cross is raised he is taken down at the order of King Ecbert.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Japanese science fiction series [[Neon Genesis Evangelion]] features crucifixion as a recurring motif.

== Music ==

=== Classical music ===
[[File:Weyden Christ on the Cross with Mary and St John.jpg|thumb|right|In music, ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' refers to compositions of a [[hymn]] of the same name, while ''[[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]]'' in art is a specific form of depiction, as in this painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], circa 1460.]]
{{Main|Passion music}}
Famous depictions of crucifixion in classical music include the ''[[St John Passion]]'' and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]'s setting of ''[[Stabat Mater]]''. Notable recent settings include the [[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|''St. Luke Passion'']] (1965) by Polish composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the [[Passio (Pärt)|''St. John Passion'']] (1982) by Estonian composer [[Arvo Pärt]]. The 2000 work, ''[[La Pasión según San Marcos (Golijov)|La Pasión según San Marcos]]'' (St. Mark Passion) by Argentinian Jewish composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]], was named one of the top classical compositions of the decade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121772989&amp;ps=bb2|accessdate=April 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Huizenga|title=The Decade In Classical Recordings|date=December 27, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of traditional passion motifs with [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[Capoeira]], and [[Kaddish]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onpointradio.org/2010/04/osvaldo-golijovs-musical-passion|accessdate=April 2, 2010|title=Osvaldo Golijov's Musical "Passion"|date=April 2, 2010|publisher=wbur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucifixion has figured prominently in Easter [[Passion cantata|cantatas]], [[oratorio]]s, and [[requiem]]s. The third section of a full [[mass (music)|mass]], the ''Credo'', contains the following passage at its climax: ''"Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato, passus et sepultus est,"'' which means "And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; he suffered and was buried." This passage was sometimes set to music separately as a ''Crucifixus'', the most famous example being that of [[Antonio Lotti]] for eight voices.

The [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven utterances of Jesus while on the Cross]], gathered from the four gospels, have inspired [[Musical settings of The Seven Last Words of Christ|many musical compositions]], from [[Heinrich Schütz]] in 1645 to Ruth Zechlin in 1996, with the best known being [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[The Seven Last Words of Christ]]'', composed in 1787.

Depictions of crucifixion outside the Christian context are rare. One of the few examples is in [[Ernest Reyer]]'s opera ''[[Salammbô (Reyer)|Salammbô]]'' (1890).

=== Popular music ===
The 1970 [[rock opera]] [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ends with Jesus' crucifixion.

The cover art of [[Tupac Shakur]]'s album [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]] features an image of Tupac being crucified on a cross. He stated that the image was not a mockery of Christ; rather, it showed how he was being "crucified" by the media.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Multiple [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] videos such as "I Don't Like The Drugs But The Drugs Like Me" and "Coma White" feature crucifixion imagery, often oddly staged in surreal modern or near modern-day settings. The Norwegian black metal band [[Gorgoroth]] had several people on stage affixed to crosses to give the appearance of crucifixion at a now infamous concert in [[Kraków]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jonathan Tisdall |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Norwegian black metal band shocks Poland – Aftenposten.no |publisher=Aftenposten.no |date= |accessdate=2009-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archivedate=2009-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated this act in the music video for "Carving a Giant." In 2006, singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] caused controversy by opening a concert held near [[Vatican City]] with a mock crucifixion, complete with a [[crown of thorns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=387254&amp;in_page_id=1773|title=Madonna under fire over mock crucifixion|work=dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Databending''' (or '''data bending''') is the process of manipulating a [[media file]] of a certain [[File format|format]], using [[software]] designed to edit files of another format. Distortions in the medium typically occur as a result, and the process either falls under a broader category of, or is frequently employed in [[glitch art]].

==Process and techniques==
The term ''databending'' is derived from [[circuit bending]], in which objects such as children's toys, [[effects pedal]]s and electronic keyboards are deliberately [[short circuit]]ed by bending the [[circuit board]] to produce erratic and spontaneous sounds. Like circuit bending,&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; databending involves the (often unpredictable) alteration of its target's behavior. Databending achieves this alteration by manipulating the information within a media file of a certain format, using software designed to edit files of a different format; distortions in the medium typically occur as a result.&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt;  

Many techniques exist, including the use of [[hex editor]]s to manipulate certain components of a [[compression algorithm]], to comparatively simple methods.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; [[Michael Betancourt]] has posed a short set of instructions, included in the [[Signal Culture |''Signal Culture Cookbook,'']] that involves the direct manipulation of the digital file using a hexadecimal editing program. One such method involves the addition of audio effects through [[audio editing software]] to distort [[raw data]] interpretations of image files. Some effects produce optical analogues: adding an [[echo]] filter duplicated elements of a photo, and inversion contributed to the flipping over of an image. The similarities result from the waveforms corresponding with the layers of pixels in a [[Linear medium|linear fashion]], ordered from top to bottom.&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt; Another method, dubbed "the WordPad effect", uses the program [[WordPad]] to manipulate images through converting the raw data to the [[Rich Text Format]].&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;

===Categorization===
According to the artist Benjamin Berg, different techniques of the process can be grouped into three categories:&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;
* Incorrect editing: Files of a certain format are manipulated using software designed to edit files of a different format.
* Reinterpretation: Files are simply converted from one medium to another.
* Forced errors: Known [[software bug]]s are exploited to force the program to terminate, usually while writing a file.
The "WordPad effect" would fall under ''incorrect editing'', while ''reinterpretation'' contains a subcategory called ''sonification'', in which data other than audio is introduced simultaneously with musical audio data. The last technique is the hardest of the three to accomplish, often yielding highly unpredictable results.&lt;ref name="Berg2008"/&gt;

==Usage and reception==
[[File:NicolaiRasterNotonLive.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Alva Noto uses sonification in his music.]]
Databending is frequently employed in [[glitch art]],&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt; and is considered a sub-category of the genre.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; The ''sonification'' technique is commonly used by [[glitch music]]ians such as [[Alva Noto]].&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; Ahuja and Lu summarized the process through a quote by Adam Clark Estes of ''[[Gizmodo]]'' as "the internet's code-heavy version of graffiti."&lt;ref name="AhujaLu2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estes2013"/&gt; Various groups on [[Flickr]] explore the effects of databending on imagery; an [[Internet bot]] named "GlitchBot" was created to scrape [[Creative Commons]]-licensed imagery and apply the process and upload the results.&lt;ref name="Geere2010"/&gt; Users on [[Vimeo]] who deal explicitly with databending and glitch art in general exist, and a [[Chicago]]-based digital art project named GLI.TC/H was funded using [[Kickstarter]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Weber2011"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Dau al Set''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈdaw əl ˈsɛt}}), the first post-[[World War II]] artistic movement in [[Catalonia]], was founded in [[Barcelona]] in September 1948 by poet [[Joan Brossa]].  The movement, best known for translating the conscious and unconscious mind into art, was heavily influenced by both the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Dada]]ist movements. In [[Catalan language|Catalan]] Dau al Set means "the seventh face of the dice", which expresses the movement's rupturist character.

== History ==
Dau al Set first began as an [[avant-garde]] artistic collective led by [[Joan Brossa]], a Catalan poet, in  September 1948. [[Joan Brossa]] established the group in response to the period’s conservative reigning government, which gained power after the [[Spanish Civil War]] known as the "[[:es:Guerra Civil Española|Guerra Civil]]". Under the new [[Fascism|fascist]] regime, [[Francisco Franco]]  radically changed many areas of the previous culture. One such example was the Spanish art community as seen in [[art and culture in Francoist Spain]]. During this time counterculture movements in Catalonia and Spain in general came to an abrupt halt.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/revista-dau-al-set-modest-cuixart-2016|title=Revista Dau al Set. Modest Cuixart|website=www.macba.cat|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such artistic groups were replaced with [[Art and culture in Francoist Spain|Nationalist Fascist Art]], which often functioned as a means for government endorsement and propaganda. In an attempt to revive the avant-garde scene in Spain Dau al Set was formed.

In 1949, with help from [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]]'s private printing press, Dau al Set published its first self-entitled magazine journal. The majority of the publication was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a language prohibited under the [[Francoist Spain|Franco Regime]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cirlot|first=Lourdes|date=December 2008|title=El grupo Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dau al Set typically ran a print between one hundred and two hundred copies,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; consisting of four to twelve pages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco Lahoz|first=Amado|date=December 2008|title=Sumario de la revista Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine journal was delivered throughout Barcelona to those with subscriptions and served a niche population at the time. The format of the magazine was 22.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 18.7&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[broadsheet]] style and never bound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These publications continued on a regular basis until the end of 1951 at which point Dau al Set began to dissolve.

In 1952, Dau al Set founding member [[Antoni Tàpies]] left the group to promote his own independent work in the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Informalism|Informal]] art styles. The following year [[Joan Ponç]] left to Brazil to continue to paint and spread his unique style. And one year later [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixcart]] left the group as well. During this time from 1953 till 1956 Dau al Set continued to be created and published by Joan-Josep Tharrats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the final years the magazine decreased from an issue a month to an issue every season to then two issues a year. The final issue was created and distributed in 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Style ==
Initially, Dau al Set began as an offshoot of [[Surrealism]], but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau al Set expands upon by combing scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from [[Joan Brossa|Joan Brossa's]] personalized style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lletra.uoc.edu/ca/revista/dau-al-set-1948-1956/detall|title=Dau al Set (1948-1956) - lletrA - Literatura catalana a internet|last=Catalunya|first=Universitat Oberta de|website=lletra.uoc.edu|language=ca|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.com/revista/arte/Dau-al-set/14686|title=Dau al set|website=www.elcultural.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau al Set. One of the most drastic was the contributions from [[Joan Ponç]]. Ponç's art frequently contained demonic images actualized with a series of different monsters throughout the work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixart's]] work often contained images of fantasy influenced by [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, [[Antoni Tàpies|Antoni Tápies]] often emulated the style of [[Paul Klee]] with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau al Set movement.

== Influences ==
Dau al Set  was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]].  Dadaism was a European art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant to fight against the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of [[cubism]], [[collage]]s, [[cut-up technique]], [[photomontage]]s, and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau al Set from this movement are [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Max Ernst]].

Another influence on Dau al Set was [[Surrealism]], a cultural movement greatly influenced by Dadaism, which began in the 1920s. This style was often considered a portrayal of the dream world; a reality which existed right below everyday life. It also had a large political focus which was often used to contradict a given community's social norms often imposed by the bourgeois. Some artists from this movement that influenced Dau al Set were [[Joan Miró]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Josep Vicenç Foix]], and [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other methods that were influenced was the idea of magical aspects that were often seen in the dream world surrealism created. However, in Dau al Set these magical aspects were developed and expounded upon.

== Members ==
There were six founding members of Dau al Set including a poet [[Joan Brossa]], a philosopher [[Arnau Puig]], three artists [[Joan Ponç]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], and [[Modest Cuixart]], as well as a dual painter and editor [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]].

Over the years Dau al Set ran there were occasional contributors, such as [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot]], [[Antonio Saura]], [[Enrique Tábara]], and [[Manolo Millares]]. Their contributions came often in the form of writings which helped to continued to establish Dau al Set as an intellectual piece of work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Dau al Set has had a lasting impact throughout history the most notable being the continuation of the avant-garde in Spain throughout a repressive regime. Moreover, Dau al Set contributed to the creation of the [[Informalism|Informalist]] movement seen in Spain during the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arteespana.com/grupodaualset.htm|title=Grupo Dau al Set|website=www.arteespana.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magical and fantasy elements of Dau al Set was seen to later emerge again in Spain in the eighties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This group also stood as a large influence for other artistic movements in Spain such as the [[Grup d'Elx|Grup d’Elx]] and El Paso, with important artists such as [[Joan Castejón]], [[Eusebio Sempere]] or [[Manolo Millares]]. Additionally, each of the members made their own impacts after the movement was dissolved. Most notably is [[Antoni Tàpies]] who continued with his style based heavily in surrealism and later became a notable artist for his work in Abstract art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10368">'''''Droit de suite''''' ([[French language|French]] for "right to follow") is a right granted to [[artist]]s or their heirs, in some jurisdictions, to receive a fee on the resale of their works of art. This should be contrasted with policies such as the American [[first-sale doctrine]], where artists do not have the right to control or profit from subsequent sales.

==History==
[[File:JEAN-FRANÇOIS MILLET - El Ángelus (Museo de Orsay, 1857-1859. Óleo sobre lienzo, 55.5 x 66 cm).jpg|thumb|''[[The Angelus (painting)|The Angelus]]'' was sold by Millet for 1,000 francs in 1865, but just 14 years after [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s death in 1889 it was sold by the copper merchant [[Eugène Secrétan|Secrétan]] for 553,000 francs]]

The ''droit de suite'' was first proposed in Europe around 1893, in response to a decrease in the importance of the salon, the end of the private patron, and to champion the cause of the “starving artist.”{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  Many artists, and their families, had suffered from the war, and ''droit de suite'' was a means to remedy socially difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060175.asp Assemblee-nationale.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], ''droit de suite'' was created in France following the sale of [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s 1858 painting, the ''[[The Angelus (painting)|Angélus]]'', in 1889 at the [[Secretan sale]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The owner of the painting made a huge profit from this sale, whereas the family of the artist lived in poverty.

==Legislation==

===European Union===
The [[Resale Rights Directive|2001/84/EC]] [[European Union directive|directive]] mandates a somewhat uniform system of ''droit de suite'' across the [[European Union]]. This directive is controversial in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/01/11/droit-de-suite-debate-heats-up/|title=‘Droit de Suite’ Debate Heats Up|first=Daniel|last=Grant|date=11 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], this system is in force through article L122-8 of the Code of intellectual property. It will be reformed by article 48 of the [[DADVSI]] law, which implements directive 2001/84/EC.  During discussions in the French Parliament leading to this law, it was argued that in practice, the ''droit de suite'' is only paid at [[auction]]s, and that it thus disfavors the Paris art marketplace compared to [[London]] or [[New York City]]. Following DADVSI, a government regulation (through a [[decree]]) is to set degressive rates and maximal fees so that the Paris marketplace is not hindered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/amendements/1206/120600232.asp Assemblee-nationale.fr] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[California Resale Royalty Act]], (Civil Code section 986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html|title=California Civil Code  Section 986 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|website=law.onecle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was struck down as unconstitutional on May 17, 2012 because it violated the US Constitution Interstate Commerce clause, ending a 35-year run that entitled [[artist]]s to a [[royalty payment]] upon the [[resale]] of their works of art under certain circumstances. The ruling by Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen of U.S. District Court Judge, Central District of California, is pending appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Nguyen added:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artsjournal.com/culturegrrl/2012/05/court_calls_california_resale.html|title = BLOG: Federal Court Finds California Resale Royalties Act Unconstitutional|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;The Court finds that the CRRA explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine art ''occurring wholly outside California'' [emphasis added]. Under its clear terms, the CRRA regulates transactions occurring anywhere in the United States, so long as the seller resides in California. Even the artist---the intended beneficiary of the CRRA---does not have to be a citizen of, or reside in, California....Therefore, the CRRA violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

California’s droit de suite statute, the California Resale Royalty Act, was enacted in 1976,&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1663016|title=The California Resale Royalty Act: Droit De [Not So] Suite|first=Emily|last=Barker|date=10 December 2009|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was struck down on May 17, 2012, pending appeal.  The law applied to all works of fine art resold in California, or resold anywhere by a California resident, for a gross sale of $1000 or more.  It had mandated a five percent royalty on the resale price of any work of fine art.  An artist was able to waive this right “by a contract in writing providing for an amount in excess of five percent of the amount of such sale.”&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt;

At least one scholar has proposed that this law is unconstitutional in that it effects a Fifth Amendment taking of private property.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/&gt;

In September 2012, the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] published a "[[Notice of Inquiry]]" regarding establishing an artist "resale royalty right" in the US.&lt;ref name="USCO-RRR"&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/ "Resale Royalty Right"], U.S. Copyright Office (last visited October 24, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Notice was published in response to a request by Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] and Senator [[Herb Kohl]], who had introduced droit de suite legislation in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Resale Royalties: An Updated Analysis|first=Maria|last=Pallante|publisher=Office of the Register of Copyrights|year=2013|url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/usco-resaleroyalty.pdf|accessdate=2015-03-07|ref=harv|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Copyright Office's subsequent report endorsed "congressional consideration of a resale royalty right, or ''droit de suite'', which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party."{{sfn|Pallante|2013|p=10}}  A follow-up bill was introduced in 2014, the American Royalties Too Act, and was vigorously opposed by auction houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/arts/design/auction-houses-taking-no-chances-on-american-royalties-too-act.html|date=2014-03-24|title=Lobbyists Set to Fight Royalty Bill for Artists|first=Patricia|last=Cohen|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill died in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2045|work=Congress.gov|title=S.2045 - American Royalties Too Act of 2014|accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia
The Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Act 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au|title=Australasian Legal Information Institute|website=www.austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the creator of an artwork the right to receive a royalty when their work is resold on the commercial art market. For artworks already in existence at 9 June 2010, the royalty applies only to the second and subsequent resales after that date. Under clauses 22 and 23 of the act artists have a case by case right to instruct the appointed government agency the Copyright Agency Ltd,  to not collect and/or make their own individual collection arrangements.

The royalty is calculated as 5% of the sale price, but does not apply where that price is less than $1,000. It is payable, via an official collecting agency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.com.au|title=The Copyright Agency|website=Copyright Agency|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''or'' if the creator chooses (on a case by case basis) it can be paid directly to the creator, on resales made during their lifetime and to their heirs for resales made up to 70 years after the creator’s death. The primary legal obligation to pay the royalty rests on the seller. However, in economic terms, it may effectively be passed on to the purchaser.

Eligible artworks include original works of graphic or plastic art, including pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware, photographs, fine art textiles, installations, fine art jewellery, artists’ books, carvings and multi-media artworks.

The royalty is restricted to Australian citizens or residents, though there is provision for reciprocal rights to be extended in the future to persons resident in other jurisdictions with compatible royalty schemes.

The introduction of the scheme was controversial, as it has been elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinsociety.com|title=Home|website=Journal of ART in SOCIETY|accessdate= 6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first three years of its operation, royalty payments totaling $1.5m were made to about 650 artists for 6,800 transactions, with about 50% going to Indigenous artists. The highest individual royalty was A$50,000. Most recipients  have received amounts ranging from A$50 to A$500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resaleroyalty.org.au|title=Copyright Agency - Royalty Resale|website=www.resaleroyalty.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average transaction cost is reportedly $30 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/qon/question?number=2677|title=Question on Notice|website=www.aph.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the scheme was announced in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov.au/visual-arts/resale-royalty-scheme|title=Resale Royalty Scheme|first=Department of Communications and the|last=Arts|date=8 August 2016|website=www.arts.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===

The Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines (Republic Act 8293) gives the author/artist or his heirs a 5-percent share in the gross proceeds of the sale or lease of the original painting, sculpture, or manuscript, subsequent to its first disposition by the creator. This right exists during the lifetime of the author or artist and fifty years after his/her death.

'''Fashion design''' is the [[art]] of applying [[design]], [[aesthetics]] and natural beauty to [[clothing]] and its [[Fashion accessory|accessories]]. It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes, and has varied over time and place. [[Fashion designers]] work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories such as bracelets and necklaces. Because of the time required to bring a garment onto the market, designers must at times [[Fashion forecasting|anticipate changes to consumer tastes]].

Designers conduct research on fashion trends and interpret them for their audience. Their specific designs are used by manufacturers. This is the essence of a designer’s role; however, there is variation within this that is determined by the buying and merchandising approach, and product quality; for example, budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends, but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1517632943/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_TIXlzbNKHZAEH|title=Fashion Buying and Merchandising: From mass-market to luxury retail|last=Hebrero|first=Miguel|date=2015-10-15|publisher=CreateSpace|year=|isbn=9781517632946|location=Printed in the USA|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn, they have a wide range and combinations of materials to work with and a wide range of colors, patterns and styles to choose from. Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional styles, unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as [[formal wear|evening wear]] or party [[dress]]es.

Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of [[haute couture]] or [[bespoke tailoring]]. Today, most clothing is designed for the [[mass market]], especially casual and every-day wear are called [[ready to wear]].

== Structure ==
Fashion designers may work full-time for one fashion house, as 'in-house designers', which owns the designs, or they work alone or as part of a team. Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops, or to clothing manufacturers. The garments bear the buyer's label. Some fashion designers set up their own labels, under which their designs are marketed. Some fashion designers are self-employed and design for individual clients. Other [[high-end]] fashion designers cater to specialty stores or high-end fashion department stores. These designers create original garments, as well as those that follow established fashion trends. Most fashion designers, however, work for apparel manufacturers, creating designs of men's, women's, and children's fashions for the mass market. Large designer brands which have a 'name' as their brand such as [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], [[Tween Brands|Justice]], or [[Juicy Couture|Juicy]] are likely to be designed by a team of individual designers under the direction of a design director.

== Designing a garment ==
Fashion designers work in different ways. Some sketch their ideas on paper, while others drape fabric on a dress form. When a designer is completely satisfied with the fit of the ''toile'' (or muslin), he or she will consult a professional pattern maker who then makes the finished, working version of the pattern out of card or via a computerized system. Finally, a sample garment is made up and tested on a model to make sure it is an operational outfit.

==History==
[[File:Chéruit Salon Paris.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Louise Chéruit|Chéruit]] salon on [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris, 1910]]
{{main article|History of fashion design}}
Fashion design is generally considered to have started in the 19th century with [[Charles Frederick Worth]] who was the first designer to have his [[label]] sewn into the garments that he created. Before the former [[draper]] set up his ''maison couture'' (fashion house) in [[Paris]], clothing design and creation was handled by largely anonymous seamstresses, and high fashion descended from that worn at royal courts. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term ''couturier'' was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered as fashion design.

It was during this period that many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs instead of presenting completed garments on models to customers began as an economy.

==Types of fashion==
The garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories

===Haute couture===
{{Main article|Haute couture}}
Until the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a [[made-to-measure]] or [[haute couture]] basis ([[French language|French]] for high-sewing), with each garment being created for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Haute Couture?|url=http://www.hautecouturenews.com/what-is-haute-couture/|work=Haute Couture Hot|publisher=HauteCoutureNews.com|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haute Couture Fashion History|url=http://fashion-era.com/haute_couture.htm|work=Fashion-Era.com|publisher=Fashion-Era.com|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Pauline Weston Thomas|format=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG7883236/Haute-couture-Making-a-loss-is-the-height-of-fashion.html|title=Haute couture: Making a loss is the height of fashion|work=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ready-to-wear (prêt-à-porter)===
{{Main article|Ready-to-wear}}

Ready-to-wear, or prêt-à-porter, clothes are a cross between haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as [[Fashion Week]]. This takes place on a citywide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of [[Fashion Week]] include, spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.

===Mass market===

}}
{{Main article|Mass market}}

Currently the [[fashion industry]] relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. To save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designers Flock to Mass-Market Retailers|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=87177&amp;page=1#.T68WL9kZHIU|work=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Catherine Valenti|format=Article|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out from Underground|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/10/31/out-from-underground.html|work=The Daily Beast|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Sameer Reddy|format=Article|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass market broached by high-end fashion |url=http://www.utepprospector.com/news/mass-market-broached-by-high-end-fashion-1.1494091#.T68YgNkZHIU |work=The Prospector |publisher=College Media Network |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Stephania Lara |format=Article |date=22 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102205229/http://www.utepprospector.com/news/mass-market-broached-by-high-end-fashion-1.1494091 |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a type of design called "kutch" design originated from the German word "kitschig" meaning "ugly" or "not aesthetically pleasing".  ''Kitsch'' can also refer to "wearing or displaying something that is therefore no longer in fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kitsch pickings|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3e2b1f30-7f3a-11e1-b3d4-00144feab49a.html#axzz1uiFiHExC|work=Financial Times Online: Style|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Bethan Cole|format=Article|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beverly Hills]], particularly on [[Rodeo Drive]], is globally renowned for its fashion design and prestigious shopping. Burgeoning industries in [[Miami]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], and especially [[San Francisco]] have developed as well. A semi-annual event held every February and September, [[New York Fashion Week]] is the oldest of the four major [[fashion week]]s held throughout the world.

Typical, British design is smart but innovative yet recently has become more and more unconventional, fusing traditional styles with modern techniques. Vintage styles play an important role in the British fashion and styling industry. Stylists regularly 'mix and match' the old with the new, which gives British style that unique, bohemian aesthetic that many of the other fashion capitals try to imitate. Irish fashion (both design and styling) is also heavily influenced by fashion trends from Britain.

===Soviet fashion design===
{{Main article|Fashion in the Soviet Union}}
Fashion in the [[Soviet Union]] largely followed general trends of the Western world. However, the state's [[Socialism|socialist ideology]] consistently moderated and influenced these trends. In addition, shortages of [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] meant that the general public did not have ready access to pre-made fashion.

===Swiss fashion design===
Most of the Swiss fashion houses are in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich labels|url=http://www.zuerich.com/files/?id=40184|work=Zurich labels: Media Information|publisher=Zurich Tourism|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss look is casual elegant and luxurious with a slight touch of quirkiness. Additionally, it has been greatly influenced by the dance club scene.

==Fashion design services==
{{or|date=April 2017}}
Fashion design services provide services like [[Trend forecasting|trend]] and color forecasting, [[market analysis]], design concepts and [[design document]]ation for [[manufacturer]]s. This way the manufacturer can contract out the design requirements rather than maintaining an in-house design team. Fashion design services providers can either sell the [[design]]s outright or license them out on a [[Royalties|royalty]] basis.

If someone is interested in launching a line in footwear, handbags, bedding etc. and are looking to outsource the design work, then a fashion design services provider can help. When initially launching the business, it might be expensive to launch with many new designs, and thus a licensing option from such a company might save startup cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS160645+17-Aug-2009+PRN20090817 27th Point Launches a New Program to Help Start-Up Manufacturers in the Home and Fashion Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design terms==
* A '''fashion designer''' conceives garment combinations of line, proportion, color, and texture. While sewing and pattern-making skills are beneficial, they are not a pre-requisite of successful fashion design. Most fashion designers are formally trained or apprenticed.
* A '''technical designer''' works with the design team and the factories overseas to ensure correct garment construction, appropriate fabric choices and a good fit. The technical designer fits the garment samples on a fit model, and decides which fit and construction changes to make before mass-producing the garment.
* A '''[[Pattern (sewing)|pattern maker]]''' (''also referred as pattern master or'' ''pattern cutter'') drafts the shapes and sizes of a garment's pieces. This may be done manually with paper and measuring tools or by using a CAD computer software program. Another method is to drape fabric directly onto a dress form. The resulting pattern pieces can be constructed to produce the intended design of the garment and required size. Formal training is usually required for working as a pattern marker.
* A '''[[tailor]]''' makes custom designed garments made to the client's measure; especially suits (coat and trousers, jacket and skirt, et cetera). Tailors usually undergo an apprenticeship or other formal training.
* A '''[[Textiles|textile designer]]''' designs fabric weaves and prints for clothes and furnishings. Most textile designers are formally trained as apprentices and in school.
* A '''[[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]]''' co-ordinates the clothes, jewelry, and accessories used in fashion photography and catwalk presentations. A stylist may also work with an individual client to design a coordinated wardrobe of garments. Many stylists are trained in fashion design, the history of fashion, and historical costume, and have a high level of expertise in the current fashion market and future market trends. However, some simply have a strong aesthetic sense for pulling great looks together.
* A '''[[fashion buyer]]''' selects and buys the mix of clothing available in retail shops, department stores, and chain stores. Most fashion buyers are trained in business and/or fashion studies.
*A '''[[seamstress]]''' sews ready-to-wear or mass-produced clothing by hand or with a sewing machine, either in a garment shop or as a sewing machine operator in a factory. She (or he) may not have the skills to make (design and cut) the garments, or to fit them on a model.
* A '''[[teacher|teacher of fashion design]]''' teaches the art and craft of fashion design in art or fashion school.
* A '''custom clothier''' makes custom-made garments to order, for a given customer.
* A '''[[dressmaker]]''' specializes in custom-made women's clothes: day, cocktail, and evening dresses, business clothes and suits, trousseaus, sports clothes, and lingerie. 

* An '''[[illustration|illustrator]]''' draws and paints clothing designs for commercial use.
* A '''[[fashion forecasting|fashion forecaster]]''' predicts what colours, styles and shapes will be popular ("on-trend") before the garments are on sale in stores.
* A '''[[Fashion model|model]]''' wears and displays clothes at fashion shows and in photographs.
* A '''[[fit model]]''' aids the fashion designer by wearing and commenting on the fit of clothes during their design and pre-manufacture. Fit models need to be a particular size for this purpose.
* A '''[[Fashion journalism|fashion journalist]]''' writes fashion articles describing the garments presented or fashion trends, for magazines or newspapers.
* An '''alterations specialist''' ('''alterationist''') adjusts the fit of completed garments, usually ready-to-wear, and sometimes re-styles them. NOTE: despite tailors altering garments to fit the client, not all alterationists are tailors.
* An '''image consultant''', '''wardrobe consultant''' or '''fashion advisor''' recommends styles and colors that are flattering to the client.

'''Gandharvanpattu''' is a [[ritual]] artform in [[North Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalpaper.mathrubhumi.com/c/15989669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mannarasala.org/dynamic.php?page=mannarasalaFestivals&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual is mainly performed by [[Vannan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.india9.com/i9show/Kenthran-Pattu-71818.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There is five [[theyyam]]s called Rudhirakkali, Varavakkali, Devathe, Mekkkaruvaal, Gandharvan in gandharvanpattu.&lt;ref&gt;http://vtzmp3.com/download/mp3-download/KDNfaI4bkSI.html&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual is performed for the blessing of [[bhootam]].

'''Graffiti''' (both singular and plural; the singular ''graffito'' is very rare in English except in archeology)&lt;ref&gt; The Italian singular form "graffito" is so rare in English (except in specialist texts on archeology) that it is not even recorded or mentioned in some dictionaries, for example the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English and the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=graffiti American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surface, usually without permission and within public view.&lt;ref name=oxd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd/&gt; Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and it has existed [[Graffito (archaeology)|since ancient times]], with examples dating back to [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], and the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Graffito"/&gt;

In modern times, paint (particularly [[aerosol paint|spray paint]]) and [[marker pen]]s have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and [[vandalism]], which is a punishable crime.

Graffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within [[hip hop culture]], graffiti have evolved alongside [[hip hop music]], [[Breakdancing|b-boying]], and other elements.&lt;ref name=powder/&gt; Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/23471|title=Why Gang Graffiti Is Dangerous - Los Angeles Police Department|website=www.lapdonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations. There are many different types and styles of graffiti; it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.

Both "graffiti" and its occasional singular form "graffito" are from the Italian word ''graffiato'' ("scratched"). "Graffiti" is applied in [[art history]] to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is "[[sgraffito]]",&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes [[chalk]] or [[coal]] were used. The word originates from Greek {{lang|el|γράφειν}}—''graphein''—meaning "to write".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/graffiti|title=graffiti {{!}} Origin and meaning of graffiti by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Graffitti, Castellania, Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Figure graffito, similar to a relief, at the Castellania, in Valletta]] 
The term ''graffiti'' referred to the [[inscription]]s, figure drawings, and such, found on the walls of ancient [[sepulchre]]s or ruins, as in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] or at [[Pompeii]]. Use of the word has evolved to include any graphics applied to surfaces in a manner that constitutes [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Old Is Graffiti?|url=http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-old-is-graffiti/|website=Wonderopolis|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only known source of the [[Safaitic]] language, a form of proto-Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern [[Syria]], eastern [[Jordan]] and northern [[Saudi Arabia]]. Safaitic dates from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/en/safaitic-database-online|title=Ancient Arabia: Languages and Cultures - Safaitic Database Online|last=dan|website=krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/ociana/index.php/safaitic|title=The Online Corpus of the Inscriptions of Ancient North Arabia - Safaitic|last=dan|website=krc.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-style graffiti===
The first known example of "modern style"{{clarify|date=June 2018}} graffiti survives in the ancient Greek city of [[Ephesus]] (in modern-day [[Turkey]]). Local guides say it is an advertisement for [[prostitution]]. Located near a [[mosaic]] and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint, a number, and a carved image of a woman's head. This is believed to indicate that a brothel was nearby, with the handprint symbolizing payment.&lt;ref name=joel/&gt;

The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than they carry in today's society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought, compared to today's popular messages of social and political ideals&lt;ref name=ancel/&gt;
The eruption of [[Vesuvius]] preserved graffiti in [[Pompeii]], which includes [[Latin]] curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans, and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a [[phallus]] accompanied by the text, ''mansueta tene'' ("handle with care").

Disappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
''Quisquis amat. veniat. Veneri volo frangere costas''
''fustibus et lumbos debilitare deae.''
''Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus''
''quit ego non possim caput illae frangere fuste?''

Whoever loves, go to hell. I want to break Venus's ribs
with a club and deform her hips.
If she can break my tender heart
why can't I hit her over the head?
&lt;/poem&gt;|''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' IV, 1824.&lt;ref&gt;CIL IV, 4200 shows a failed attempt to write this little poem, maybe because the writer forgot the verses: see F. A. Todd, "Three Pompeian Wall-Inscriptions, and Petronius" in ''The Classical Review'', Vol. 53, No. 1 (Feb., 1939), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/706251?uid=2134&amp;uid=2476609927&amp;uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=2476609917&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21104320244421 page 6 note 2] and ''Rediscovering Pompeii'', L'Erma di Bretschneider, Roma, 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ciNtH6c9RDQC&amp;pg=PA39 page 39 note 85].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient tourists visiting the 5th-century citadel at [[Sigiriya]] in Sri Lanka scribbled over 1800 individual graffiti there between the 6th and 18th centuries. Etched on the surface of the Mirror Wall, they contain pieces of prose, poetry, and commentary. The majority of these visitors appear to have been from the elite of society: royalty, officials, professions, and clergy. There were also soldiers, archers, and even some metalworkers. The topics range from love to satire, curses, wit, and lament. Many demonstrate a very high level of literacy and a deep appreciation of art and poetry.&lt;ref name=ponnam/&gt; Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes of semi-nude females found there. One reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Wet with cool dew drops
fragrant with perfume from the flowers
came the gentle breeze
jasmine and water lily
dance in the spring sunshine
side-long glances
of the golden-hued ladies
stab into my thoughts
heaven itself cannot take my mind
as it has been captivated by one lass
among the five hundred I have seen here.&lt;ref name=parana/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the ancient political graffiti examples were [[Arab]] satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between [[Sistan|Sajistan]] and [[Basra]], manifesting a strong hatred towards the [[Umayyad]] regime and its ''[[wali]]s'', and people used to read and circulate them very widely.&lt;ref&gt;حسين مروّة، '''تراثنا كيف نعرفه'''، مؤسسة الأبحاث العربية، بيروت، 1986{{clarify|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2014}}

===Literacy or illiteracy often revealed in graffiti===
Historic forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in these graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are ''CIL'' IV, 7838: ''Vettium Firmum / aed''[ilem] ''quactiliar''[ii] {{sic}} ''rog''[ant]. Here, "qu" is pronounced "co". The 83 pieces of graffiti found at ''CIL'' IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a [[peristyle]] which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect [[Crescens]]. The graffiti were left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at ''CIL'' VII, 12, 18–20 contains more than 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The [[gladiator]]ial academy at ''CIL'' IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (''Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex'': "Celadus the [[Thracians|Thracian]] makes the girls sigh.")

Another piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Landlord, may your lies malign
Bring destruction on your head!
You yourself drink unmixed wine,
Water [do you] sell [to] your guests instead.&lt;ref name=olmert/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was not only the Greeks and Romans who produced graffiti: the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]] contains examples of [[ancient Maya graffiti]]. [[Viking]] graffiti survive in Rome and at [[Newgrange|Newgrange Mound]] in Ireland, and a [[Varangian]] scratched his name (Halvdan) in [[Runic alphabet|rune]]s on a [[banister]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]]. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures.

Graffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;
When [[Renaissance]] artists such as [[Pinturicchio]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], or [[Filippino Lippi]] descended into the ruins of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]], they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the ''[[grottesche]]'' style of decoration.&lt;ref name="archeology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

There are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], a national landmark along the [[Oregon Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence Rock - California National Historic Trail (National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/site5.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|campaign of Egypt]] in the 1790s.&lt;ref name=JinxArtCrimes/&gt; [[Lord Byron]]'s survives on one of the columns of the Temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Cape Sounion]] in [[Attica]], Greece.&lt;ref name=shanks/&gt;

== Contemporary graffiti ==
Graffiti writing is often intertwined with [[hip hop culture]]&lt;ref name="genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Paul-edwards-is-graffiti-really-an-element-of-hip-hop-book-excerpt-annotated|title=Is Graffiti Really An Element Of Hip-Hop?

However, there are many other instances of notable graffiti in the twentieth century. Graffiti have long appeared on building walls, in [[latrine]]s, railroad [[boxcar]]s, [[rapid transit|subways]], and bridges. The oldest known example of modern graffiti is found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers started more than eighty years ago, called Bozo Texino, documented by filmmaker [[Bill Daniel (filmmaker)|Bill Daniel]] in his 2005 film, ''Who is Bozo Texino?''.&lt;ref name="bozo-texino-walker"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/calendar/2010/who-is-bozo-texino|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bozo-texino-film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billdaniel.net/who-is-bozo-texino/|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=2005|work=Who Is Bozo Texino?

Some graffiti have their own poignancy. In [[World War II]], an inscription on a wall at the fortress of [[Verdun]] was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:&lt;ref name=reagan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/14/opinion/words-from-a-war.html|title=Words From a War|date=14 August 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;

Austin White – Chicago, Ill – 1945
This is the last time I want to write my name here.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During World War II and for decades after, the phrase "[[Kilroy was here]]" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of [[Charlie Parker]] (nicknamed "Yardbird" or "Bird"), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words "Bird Lives".&lt;ref name=russel/&gt; The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire'' ("Boredom is counterrevolutionary") expressed in painted graffiti, [[poster]] art, and [[stencil]] art. At the time in the US, other political phrases (such as "Free Huey" about [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Huey Newton]]) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the early 1970s was "Dick [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Nixon]] Before He Dicks You", reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that US president.

===Advent of aerosol paint===
Rock and roll graffiti is a significant subgenre. A famous graffito of the twentieth century was the inscription in the London tube reading "Clapton is God" in a link to the guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[Islington]] station on the [[London Underground|Underground]] in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is [[Urine marking#Canidae|urinating on the wall]].

Graffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment [[punk rock]] movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Crass]] (and their followers) widely [[stencil]]ed their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats, and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band [[Missing Foundation]] was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan, and was copied by hard core punk fans throughout the US and West Germany.&lt;ref name=myspace/&gt;

Along similar lines was the legend "[[Frodo Lives!|Frodo Lives]]," referring to the protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Spread of hip hop culture===
In 1979, graffiti artist [[Lee Quinones]] and [[Fab Five Freddy|Fab 5 Freddy]] were given a gallery opening in Rome by art dealer Claudio Bruni. For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with their art form. Fab 5 Freddy's friendship with [[Debbie Harry]] influenced [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s single "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" ([[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], 1981), the video of which featured [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop.&lt;ref name=chesh/&gt; Charlie Ahearn's independently released fiction film ''[[Wild Style]]'' (Wild Style, 1983), the early [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'' (1983), hit songs such as "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" and "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" and their accompanying [[music video]]s (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop.&lt;ref name="genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook" /&gt;

''Style Wars'' depicted not only famous graffiti artists such as Skeme, [[DONDI|Dondi]], MinOne, and [[Zephyr (artist)|ZEPHYR]], but also reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture by incorporating famous early break-dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=labonte/&gt; Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983.&lt;ref name=hershk/&gt; Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers such as [[PHASE 2]] as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984).

===Stencil graffiti emerges===
This period also saw the emergence of the new [[stencil graffiti]] genre. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by graffiti artist [[Blek le Rat]] in Paris, in 1982 by [[Jef Aerosol]] in Tours (France);{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and [[Melbourne]], where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Graffiti as a memorial===
People often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffito often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person's presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffito is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Commercialization and entrance into mainstream pop culture===
{{Main|Commercial graffiti}}
With the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] [[mascot]]), to represent "Peace, Love, and Linux." Due to laws forbidding it, some of the "street artists" were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.&lt;ref name=guerilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

In 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by [[Sony]] and executed by [[TATS CRU]] in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] gaming system. In [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|this campaign]], taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings "a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse".&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

===Gamer culture===
Along with the commercial growth has come the rise of [[video game]]s also depicting graffiti, usually in a positive aspect – for example, the ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' [[freedom of speech]]. In plotlines mirroring the negative reaction of non-commercial artists to the commercialization of the art form by companies such as IBM (and, later, Sony itself) the ''[[Graffiti Kingdom|Rakugaki Ōkoku]]'' series (2003–2005) for Sony's [[PlayStation 2]] revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Following the original roots of modern graffiti as a political force came another game title, ''[[Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]'' (2006), featuring a story line involving fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the ''Jet Set Radio'' series.

Other games which feature graffiti include ''[[Klark Kent|Bomb the World]]'' (2004), an online graffiti simulation created by graffiti artist [[Klark Kent]] where users can paint trains virtually at 20 locations worldwide, and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' (2002), in which the hero, [[Mario]] must clean the city of graffiti left by the villain, [[Bowser Jr.]] in a plotline which evokes the successes of the Anti-Graffiti Task Force of New York's Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] (a manifestation of the "[[Fixing Broken Windows|broken window theory]]") or those of the "[[Graffiti Blasters]]" of Chicago's Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]].

Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti (such as the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], the [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk's'' series]], ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'', ''[[Rolling (video game)|Rolling]]'', and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''). ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which is a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod, allows users to create their own graffiti tags to use in the game. Many other titles contain in-game depictions of graffiti, including ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'', ''[[Double Dragon (series)#Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone|Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone]]'', ''[[NetHack]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked]]'', ''[[The World Ends with You]]'', ''[[The Warriors (video game)|The Warriors]]'', ''[[Just Cause (video game)|Just Cause]]'', ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and various examples of [[Virtual Graffiti#Gaming|Virtual Graffiti]]. There also exist games where the term "graffiti" is used as a synonym for "drawing" (such as ''[[Yahoo! Graffiti]]'', ''[[ImagiNation Network#SierraLand|Graffiti]]'', etc.).

===Advocates===
[[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that "Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career."&lt;ref name=sohh/&gt;

[[Henry Chalfant]] is one of the foremost advocates of modern graffiti, having produced the documentary film [[Style Wars]] and co-authored the books ''[[Subway Art]]'' and ''Spray Can Art''. His most recent work, ''Henry Chalfant's Graffiti Archive: New York City's Subway Art and Artists'' displays his over 800 photographs of New York City Subway Graffiti Art.&lt;ref name=chalf/&gt;

[[Keith Haring]] was another well-known graffiti artist who brought Pop Art and graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works, which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities such as bags and t-shirts. Haring explained that "The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement."&lt;ref name="haring-foundation-site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haring.com/!/pop-shop|title=Pop Shop|date=2018|work=The Keith Haring Foundation Website|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Keith|last=Haring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti have become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] communities in North America and abroad. Within the United States graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah, and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel, and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8, Osiris, or Circa&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, and The Mac who have made the switch to being gallery artists, often not even using their initial medium, spray paint.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

But perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is the French crew [[123Klan]].  Founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, 123Klan has gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for the likes of Nike, Adidas, Lamborghini, Coca Cola, Stussy, Sony, Nasdaq, and more.&lt;ref name=grafica/&gt;&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Yarnbus.jpg|thumb|This bus has been [[yarn bombing|yarn bombed]] by a team of knitters. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

===Global developments===

====South America====
There is a significant graffiti tradition in South America, especially in [[Brazil]]. Within Brazil, [[São Paulo]] is a significant centre of inspiration for many graffiti artists worldwide.&lt;ref name=manco/&gt;

Tristan Manco wrote that Brazil "boasts a unique and particularly rich, graffiti scene&amp;nbsp;... [earning] it an international reputation as the place to go for artistic inspiration." Graffiti "flourishes in every conceivable space in Brazil's cities." Artistic parallels "are often drawn between the energy of São Paulo today and 1970s New York." The "sprawling metropolis," of São Paulo has "become the new shrine to graffiti;" Manco alludes to "poverty and unemployment&amp;nbsp;... [and] the epic struggles and conditions of the country's marginalised peoples," and to "Brazil's chronic poverty," as the main engines that "have fuelled a vibrant graffiti culture." In world terms, Brazil has "one of the most uneven distributions of income. Laws and taxes change frequently." Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the "folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised," that is South American graffiti art.&lt;ref name=manco7/&gt;

Prominent Brazilian graffiti artists include [[Os Gêmeos]], Boleta, [[Francisco Rodrigues da Silva|Nunca]], Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak.&lt;ref name=globo/&gt; Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures&lt;ref name=nicek/&gt; has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of ''pichação'' and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of ''grafite''.&lt;ref name=revela/&gt;

====Middle East====

Graffiti in the [[Middle East]] is emerging slowly, with pockets of taggers operating in the various 'Emirates' of the [[United Arab Emirates]], in [[Israel]], and in [[Iran]]. The major Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist [[A1one]]'s works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, ''PingMag'', has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work.&lt;ref name=pinmag/&gt; The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Many graffiti artists in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference  "נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן" ("[[Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman]]") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.

====Southeast Asia====
There are also a large number of graffiti influences in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries that mostly come from modern [[Western culture]], such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.&lt;ref name=kharbar/&gt;

== Characteristics of common graffiti ==
{{See also|Graffiti terminology|Graffiti in the United States}}

===Methods and production===
The modern-day graffiti artist can be found with an arsenal of various materials that allow for a successful production of a piece.&lt;ref name=nicolas/&gt; This includes such techniques as [[Scribing (graffiti)|scribing]]. However, [[spray paint]] in aerosol cans is the number one medium for graffiti. From this commodity comes different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and comes in virtually every color.

[[Stencil graffiti]], originating in the early 1980s ([[Blek le Rat]], [[Jef Aerosol]], [[Speedy Graphito]], [[Miss Tic]] ... ) is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] or subject [[File folder|folder]]s) to form an overall design or image.&lt;ref name=drupal/&gt; The stencil is then placed on the "canvas" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface. This method of graffiti is popular amongst artists because of its swift technique that requires very little time. Time is always a factor with graffiti artists due to the constant threat of being caught by law enforcement.

===Modern experimentation===

[[File:Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier.JPG|thumbnail|Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier both hides and highlights previous graffiti.]]
Modern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, [[Graffiti Research Lab]] has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes ([[LED art|throwies]]) as new media for graffiti artists. [[Yarnbombing]] is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffiti artists.

===Tagging===

Some of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A '''tag''' is the most basic writing of an artist's name; it is simply a [[handstyle]]. A graffiti writer's tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and may incorporate the artist's crew initials or other letters.

One form of tagging, known as '''pissing''', involves taking a refillable fire-extinguisher and replacing the contents with paint, allowing for tags as high as approximately {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy.

Another form is the '''throw-up''', also known as a '''bombing''', which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A '''piece''' is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. A '''blockbuster''' or '''roller''' is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.

A more complex style is '''[[wildstyle]]''', a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffiti artists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.

Some artists also use self-adhesive '''stickers''' as a quick way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.

Many graffiti artists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) from 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for [[Saber (artist)|Saber]] MSK while working on the world's largest graffiti piece on the LA river.

Another graffiti artist can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw-up. This was exemplified by the writer "CAP" in the documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'', who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as '''capping''' and often is done when there is a "beef", or conflict between writers.

A number of recent examples of graffiti make use of [[hashtags]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2015/07/23/hashtag-on-the-pavement-connects-with-fitzrovias-past/] "Hashtag on the pavement connects with Fitzrovia's past", Fitzrovia News, 23 July 2015, Retrieved 17 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://massappeal.com/riskrock-graffiti-in-san-francisco/] "#RISKROCK #GRAFFITI IN #SANFRANCISCO", Mass Appeal, Retrieved 17 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Theories on the use of graffiti by [[avant-garde]] artists have a history dating back at least to the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]] in 1961.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Many contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of [[public art]]. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social [[political emancipation|emancipation]] or, in the achievement of a political goal.&lt;ref name=thimar/&gt;

The murals of [[Belfast]] and of Los Angeles offer another example of official recognition.&lt;ref name=rpmural/&gt; In times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus, of addressing cleavages in the long run. The [[Berlin Wall]] was also extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule over the [[East Germany|GDR]].

Many artists involved with graffiti are also concerned with the similar activity of [[stenciling]]. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognized while [[Art exhibition|exhibiting]] and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] and [[Urban area|urban Britain]] in the early 2000s, graffiti artist [[M.I.A. (artist)|Mathangi Arulpragasam, aka M.I.A.]], has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her [[music videos]] for singles "[[Galang (song)|Galang]]" and "[[Bucky Done Gun]]", and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in [[Brick Lane]], stuck to lamp posts and street signs, she having become a muse for other graffiti artists and painters worldwide in cities including [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=teleci/&gt; Graffiti artist [[John Fekner]], called "caption writer to the urban environment, adman for the opposition" by writer [[Lucy Lippard]],&lt;ref name=lippard/&gt; was involved in direct art interventions within New York City's [[Urban decay|decaying]] urban environment in the mid-1970s through the 1980s. Fekner is known for his word installations targeting social and political issues, stenciled on buildings throughout New York.

=== Personal expression ===
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating personal expression]]Graffiti artists constantly have the looming threat of facing consequences for displaying their graffiti. Many choose to protect their identities and reputation by remaining anonymous.

With the commercialization of graffiti (and [[hip hop]] in general), in most cases, even with legally painted "graffiti" art, graffiti artists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the [[hip hop#Cultural pillars|one of four hip hop elements]] that is not considered "performance art" despite the image of the "singing and dancing star" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffiti artists still fall in the category of the [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introverted archetypal artist]].

[[Banksy]] is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society.&lt;ref name=banksy/&gt; He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in [[Bristol, England]], but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial [[West Bank]] barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]] also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.

[[Pixnit]] is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public.&lt;ref name=shaer/&gt; Her work focuses on beauty and design aspects of graffiti as opposed to Banksy's anti-government shock value. Her paintings are often of flower designs above shops and stores in her local urban area of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Some store owners endorse her work and encourage others to do similar work as well. "One of the pieces was left up above Steve's Kitchen, because it looks pretty awesome"- Erin Scott, the manager of [[New England Comics]] in [[Allston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Radical and political ===
[[File:M2109 Iraq War Protest (Black Bloc Element).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Black bloc]] members spray graffiti on a wall during an [[Protests against the Iraq War#March 21, 2009|Iraq War Protest]] in Washington, D.C.]]
Graffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]], who conducted a campaign of stenciling [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]], and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages throughout the [[London Underground]] system during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=souther/&gt; In [[Amsterdam]] graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered with names such as "De Zoot", "Vendex", and "Dr Rat".&lt;ref name=stockho/&gt; To document the graffiti a punk magazine was started that was called ''Gallery Anus''. So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.

The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire'' ("Boredom is counterrevolutionary") and ''Lisez moins, vivez plus'' ("Read less, live more"). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.

{{quote box|align=right|width=220px|quote=I think graffiti writing is a way of defining what our generation is like. Excuse the French, we're not a bunch of p---- artists. Traditionally artists have been considered soft and mellow people, a little bit kooky. Maybe we're a little bit more like pirates that way. We defend our territory, whatever space we steal to paint on, we defend it fiercely.|source=—Sandra "Lady Pink" Fabara&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;}}

The developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as "on the street" or "underground", contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the [[subvertising]], [[culture jamming]], or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of [[Street Art]], a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting&lt;ref name="ziptopia-switch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zipcar.com/ziptopia/city-living/temporary-street-art-changing-the-graffiti-game|title=Temporary Street Art That's Changing The Graffiti Game|work=Ziptopia|first=STEVEN|last=HARRINGTON |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost-streetart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-english/street-art-its-not-meant-_b_5610496.html|title=Street Art: It's Not Meant to be Permanent|work=Huffington Post|first=Ron|last=English|date=6 Dec 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a variety of reasons—but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend them and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street—such protest are impermanent, but effective nevertheless.

In some areas where a number of artists share the impermanence ideal, an informal competition develops:  the length of time that a work escapes destruction is viewed as a measure of the respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would be invariably removed immediately, while the most talented artists might have works last for days.

Contemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as [[Alexander Brener]], have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.&lt;ref name="voice" /&gt;
The practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the [[Space Hijackers]] did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political [[imagery]].&lt;ref name="tanyabaxter-Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tanyabaxtercontemporary.com/banksy#!Banksy_Flying_Copper__screen_print_on_paper__100_x_70_cm|title= Banksy |work=Tanya Baxter Contemporary Gallery|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haynes-banksy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/Banksy--|title= Banksy |work=Haynes Fine Art|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the political aspect of graffiti as a [[Cultural movement|movement]], political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. [[far-left]] or [[far-right]] groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money – or sometimes the desire – to buy [[advertising]] to get their message across, and that a "[[ruling class]]" or "establishment" controls the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical and alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example [[Fascism|fascist]] supporters often scrawl [[swastika]]s and other [[Nazism|Nazi]] images.

One innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of [[underground press]] writers such as the poet and playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for [[counterculture]] propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a [[John Bull]] printing set. Although short lived, the MLF was representative of London's [[Ladbroke Grove]] centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable [[anti-establishment]] and humorous street graffiti, much of which is also produced by Williams.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as "Death to the dictator". In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as "Banks=Robbers", relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis.

Both sides of the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti includes large wall paintings, referred to as ''[[Northern Irish murals|murals]]''. Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the ''[[Belfast Peace Lines|Peace Lines]]'', high walls that separate different communities.

The murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or [[iconographic]] content. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England|William III]] in the late seventeenth century, whereas [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] murals usually refer to the more recent [[The Troubles|troubles]].

Territorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic [[symbols]] and [[initials]] strictly fashioned with unique [[calligraphies]]. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;

=== As advertising ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
Graffiti has been used as a means of advertising both legally and illegally. [[The Bronx|Bronx]]-based [[TATS CRU]] has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Toyota]], and [[MTV]]. In the UK, Covent Garden's [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes that cross referencing would promote their store.

Tech Giants Hewlett Packard used graffiti company [[Darren Cullen#Graffiti Kings|Graffiti Kings]] based in London to showcase the creative use for their Sprout computer by producing a video, during the video Hewlett Packard showed many pieces of graffiti art while the Graffiti Kings artist used the Sprout computer to draw digital graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11408538/HP-Sprout-is-this-the-future-of-desktop-computing.html|title=HP Sprout: is this the future of desktop computing?|newspaper= Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graffitikings.co.uk/hp-hewlett-packard-sprout-graffiti-kings/|title=
HP – Hewlett Packard Sprout &amp; Graffiti Kings|website= Graffitikings|date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smirnoff]] hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. [[Shepard Fairey]] rose to fame after his "Andre the Giant Has a Posse" sticker campaign, in which his art was plastered in cities throughout America.

Many graffiti artists see legal advertising as no more than "paid for and legalised graffiti", and have risen against mainstream ads. The [[Graffiti Research Lab]] crew have gone on to target several prominent ads in New York as a means of making a statement against this practice.

=== Offensive graffiti ===
[[File:Stop graffitti.jpg|thumb|Gang symbol markings on public property, [[Millwood, Washington]]]]
Graffiti may also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti may be difficult to identify, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils which have adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly).&lt;ref name=halsey/&gt; Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight, not easily recognized as "racist". It can then only be understood if one knows the relevant "local code" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as [[heteroglossia|heteroglot]] and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.&lt;ref name=holqu/&gt;
:A spatial code for example, could be that there is a certain youth group in an area that is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti containing only the name or abbreviation of this gang already is a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases, the [[herald]] of more serious criminal activity to come.&lt;ref name=kelling/&gt; A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger.
Hence, the lack of obvious racist graffiti does not necessarily mean that there is none. By making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints),&lt;ref name=barker/&gt; these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.&lt;ref name=lynn/&gt;

Elsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted [[caricature]]s of local officials with their mouths as [[pothole]]s, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schreck |first=Carl |date=2015-06-19 |title=Russian politicians mocked with guerrilla pothole portraits |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/russia-pothole-portraits-activists-banksy |website= New East Network |access-date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Manchester, England]] a graffiti artist painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in their being repaired within 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2015-04-29 |title=Meet the man using penises to fill potholes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11570595/Meet-the-man-using-penises-to-fill-potholes.html |website= The Telegraph |access-date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 exhibition at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] displayed graffiti as an art form that began in New York's [[outer boroughs]] and reached great heights in the early 1980s with the work of Crash, Lee, Daze, [[Keith Haring]], and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. It displayed 22 works by New York graffiti artists, including [[Crash (graffiti artist)|Crash]], Daze, and [[Lady Pink]]. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine ''Time Out'', curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti. [[Terrance Lindall]], an artist and executive director of the Williamsburg Art and Historic Center, said regarding graffiti and the exhibition:&lt;ref name=tonyk/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Graffiti is revolutionary, in my opinion", he says, "and any revolution might be considered a crime. People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls—it's free."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, [[Burhan Dogancay]] photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as "Walls of the World" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled "Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent..." (The walls whisper, shout and sing ... ) at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]].

In Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts. [[Oxford University Press]]'s art history text ''Australian Painting 1788–2000'' concludes with a long discussion of graffiti's key place within contemporary [[visual culture]], including the work of several Australian practitioners.&lt;ref name=smithea/&gt;

Between March and April 2009, 150 artists exhibited 300 pieces of graffiti at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris — a clear acceptance of the art form into the French [[art world]].&lt;ref name=rfi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rohter/&gt;

Many graffiti artists have used their design talents in other artistic endeavors. In 2009 graffiti artist "[[Scape (graffiti artist)|Scape]]" published ''GRAFF; the Art &amp; Technique of Graffiti'', the world's first book dedicated to displaying the full techniques of creating graffiti art. Other books that focus on graffiti include ''Faith of Graffiti'' by Norman Mailer, ''Trespass'' by Taschen press,&lt;ref name=urbana/&gt; and the comic book by [[Elite Gudz]], ''Concrete Immortalz'', which has a graffiti artist as its main character.

Figurines by [[KAWS (artist)|KAWS]], featuring icons of pop culture, often with crossed-out eyes, run in limited editions and sell for thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=intmag/&gt; World-renowned street artist Banksy directed a film in 2010, ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'', which explored street art and commercialism.

==Environmental effects==
[[Spray paint]] has many negative environmental effects. The paint contains toxic chemicals, and the can uses [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or volatile hydrocarbon gases to spray the paint unto a surface.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} As an alternative, [[moss graffiti]] is starting to catch on,&lt;ref name=envirog/&gt; which uses [[moss]] to create text or images. The moss is glued onto a surface by means of [[beer]], [[buttermilk]], or [[yogurt]] combined with [[sugar]].&lt;ref name=space/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetka/&gt;

== Government responses ==

=== Asia ===
In China, [[Mao Zedong]] in the 1920s used revolutionary slogans and paintings in public places to galvanise the country's communist revolution.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

In Hong Kong, [[Tsang Tsou Choi]] was known as the ''King of Kowloon'' for his [[calligraphy]] graffiti over many years, in which he claimed ownership of the area. Now some of his work is preserved officially.

In [[Taiwan]], the government has made some concessions to graffiti artists. Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated "Graffiti Zones".&lt;ref name=taitimes/&gt; From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (李永萍) stated, "We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in [[Ximending]], a popular shopping district. Graffiti artists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to $6,000 TWD under a department of environmental protection regulation.&lt;ref name=taitimes2/&gt; However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, "Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved. We don't go after it proactively."&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

In 1993, after several expensive cars in [[Singapore]] were spray-painted, the police arrested a student from the [[Singapore American School]], [[Michael P. Fay]], questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 [[Vandalism Act (Singapore)|Vandalism Act of Singapore]], originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a [[caning]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for [[pardon|clemency]], Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding [[president of Singapore]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]], agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]], Park Jung-soo was fined 2 million [[South Korean won]] by the [[Seoul]] Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the [[G-20]] Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in "G-20" sounds like the Korean word for "rat", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Mr. Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of ROK, [[Lee Myung-bak]], the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression. The court ruled that the painting, "an ominous creature like a rat" amounts to "an organized criminal activity" and upheld the fine while denying the prosecution's request for imprisonment for Park.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:Graffiti removal berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti removal in Berlin]]
In Europe, community cleaning squads have responded to graffiti, in some cases with reckless abandon, as when in 1992 in France a local Scout group, attempting to remove modern graffiti, damaged [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/26895452 two prehistoric paintings] of [[bison]] in the [[Cave of Mayrière supérieure]] near the French village of [[Bruniquel]] in [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], earning them the 1992 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in [[archeology]].&lt;ref name=improb/&gt;

In September 2006, the European Parliament directed the European Commission to create urban environment policies to prevent and eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animal excrement, and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.&lt;ref name=europa/&gt;

The [[Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003]] became Britain's latest anti-graffiti legislation. In August 2004, the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] campaign issued a press release calling for [[zero tolerance]] of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing "on the spot" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16.&lt;ref name=encams/&gt; The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in [[music video]]s, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed 'cool' or 'edgy' image.

To back the campaign, 123 [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s (including then [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]), signed a charter which stated: "Graffiti is not art, it's crime. On behalf of my constituents, I will do all I can to rid our community of this problem."&lt;ref name=wire/&gt; However, since the early 1990s, the British graffiti scene has been struck by self-titled "art terrorist" Banksy, who has revolutionized the style of UK graffiti (bringing to the forefront stencils to aid the speed of painting), as well as the content; making his work largely satirical of the sociological state of cities, or the political climate of war, often using monkeys and rats as motifs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the UK, city councils have the power to take action against the owner of any property that has been defaced under the [[Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003]] (as amended by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050016_en_1 Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005]) or, in certain cases, the Highways Act. This is often used against owners of property that are complacent in allowing protective boards to be defaced so long as the property is not damaged.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In July 2008, a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charge was used to convict graffiti artists for the first time. After a three-month police surveillance operation,&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; nine members of the DPM crew were convicted of conspiracy to commit [[criminal damage]] costing at least £1 million. Five of them received prison sentences, ranging from eighteen months to two years. The unprecedented scale of the investigation and the severity of the sentences rekindled public debate over whether graffiti should be considered art or crime.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

Some councils, like those of Stroud and Loerrach, provide approved areas in the town where graffiti artists can showcase their talents, including underpasses, car parks, and walls that might otherwise prove a target for the 'spray and run.'&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt;

In [[Budapest]], Hungary both a city-backed movement called ''I Love Budapest'' and a special police division tackle the problem, including the provision of approved areas.&lt;ref name=index/&gt;

=== Australia ===
[[File:Graffiti tunnel 2009, University of Sydney.jpg|thumb|Graffiti Tunnel, University of Sydney at [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] (2009)]]
In an effort to reduce vandalism, many cities in Australia have designated walls or areas exclusively for use by graffiti artists. One early example is the "Graffiti Tunnel" located at the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] Campus of the [[University of Sydney]], which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and create "art". Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or [[trespassing]].&lt;ref name=warrin/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere.&lt;ref name=towno/&gt; Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced "anti-graffiti squads", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.

Many state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.

[[Melbourne]] is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne|Hosier Lane]] in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The [[Lonely Planet]] travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including [[sticker]] art, [[poster]], [[stencil]] art, and [[wheatpasting]], can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]], and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a [[perspex]] screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.&lt;ref name=wato/&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
[[File:Christchurch Stock Yards.jpg|thumb|Former Christchurch stock yards]]
In February 2008 [[Helen Clark]], the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in [[Auckland]] during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of [[manslaughter]].

====Tracker databases====
Graffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all of the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all of the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them to not only focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.&lt;ref name=crcp/&gt;

====Gang injunctions====
Many restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles and/or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing the property of another, both public and private property, including, but limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, trees, or power pole.&lt;ref name=crcp2 /&gt;

====Hotlines and reward programs====
To help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided, and the action taken.&lt;ref name=lawtec/&gt;

====Search warrants====
When the police use search warrants in connection with a vandalism investigation they are often seeking judicial approval to look for items such as cans of spray paint and nozzles from other kinds of aerosol sprays, etching tools, or other sharp or pointed objects used to etch or scratch glass and other hard surfaces, such as permanent marking pens and markers or paint sticks; evidence of membership or affiliation with any gang or tagging crew, paraphernalia to include any reference to "(tagger's name)," and any drawings, writings, objects, or graffiti depicting taggers' names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or mention of tagging crew membership; any newspaper clippings relating details of or referring to any graffiti crime.&lt;ref name=paladin/&gt;

'''Haerlempjes''' refer to a specific [[genre]] of [[landscape painting]] that includes a view of [[Haarlem]] (formerly spelled ''Haerlem''). It is used most often to refer to [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]'s panoramic views of the city, but the term is derived from mentions in Haarlem archives as a type of painting included in household inventories.&lt;ref name=Haerlem&gt;'Woonplaats op een hoogte', Haerlem Jaarboek (1994), Historische Werkgroep Haerlem, pp 23-34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diminutive]] suffix "pje" would denote a small, cabinet-sized painting, but even the largest landscapes may be referred to as ''Haerlempjes'' today.
==Background==
[[File:Situatie schets van dolhuys ten tijde van beleg van haarlem.JPG|thumb|View of Haarlem from the North during the [[siege of Haarlem]], historical print from 1628]]

In his biography of [[Albert van Ouwater]], [[Karel van Mander]] claimed that ''It is said from the mouths of the oldest painters, that landscape painting originated in Haarlem''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0186.php "Daer wort oock gheseyt en getuyght, uyt de monden der oudtste Schilders, dat te Haerlem is van oudts ontstaen, en begonnen de beste en eerste maniere van Landtschap te maken."] in Van Mander's [[Schilder-boeck]] in the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Van Mander was writing in 1604 for his Haarlem-sponsored [[Schilder-boeck]], and his was one of many initiatives to rebuild the city and glorify its history. After his book was published, the city attracted several landscape painters in the 1620s, including [[Esaias van de Velde]], [[Jan van Goyen]] and the Ruisdael brothers [[Salomon van Ruysdael|Salomon]] and [[Isaack van Ruisdael|Isaack]].

Haarlem is a bustling city today that makes up part of the [[Randstad]] area of the Netherlands, so it helps when looking at these old paintings to orient oneself according to old maps.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hobbyists love to look at older Haarlem cityscapes and pick out features such as steeples and boats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haarlemopdekaart.nl/ Website for 2014 exhibition] by North Holland Archives showing Haarlem skyline photos superimposed on a map&lt;/ref&gt; For paintings traditionally called Haerlempjes, such features have been proven to be based more on historical accuracy rather than artist fantasy.&lt;ref name=Biesboer&gt;''Topografische identificatie van een aantal Haerlempjes van Jacob van Ruisdael'', by [[Pieter Biesboer]], published in: ''Textiel aan het Spaarne : Haarlem : van linnen damast tot zijden linten'', Textielcommissie Nederland, Amsterdam, 1997 {{ISBN|978-90-800872-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though fantasy cityscapes were popular in the Netherlands throughout the 17th-century, these seem to be more often pastiches of southern harbours or italianate landscapes, rather than places that artists had conceivably visited. Today, for example, it is assumed that Jacob van Ruisdael worked in [[View of Bentheim Castle|Bentheim]] because he painted many accurate views of the castle there. However, he often painted such castle views situated in a fantasy landscape on a mountain top, though the castle is in fact situated in low rolling countryside. In Haarlem, though he painted many ''dunescapes'' of the [[Kennemerland]] area, he never turned those dunes into mountains.
==Early views of Haerlem==
Most travellers visiting Haarlem in the middle of the 17th-century were on their way from [[The Hague]] to [[Amsterdam]] and saw the city from the [[Spaarne]] river, as most intercity travel was by [[trekschuit]] or sailing ship. Thus many early cityscapes are taken from the point of view of the river traveller.

==Dunescapes==
[[File:Landscape with a Sandy Road by Jan Steen Frans Hals Museum os 2011-13.jpg|thumb|Even the genre painter [[Jan Steen]] produced some dune landscapes in Haarlem in the 1640s, though it is unknown whether he painted any ''Haerlempjes'']]
The popularity of such river-based cityscapes were offset by another type of landscape with dunes or windmills that included a Haarlem cityscape on the horizon.

==Panoramas of Haerlem==
[[File:View of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds c1665 Ruisdael.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Haarlem with Bleaching Fields]],'' viewpoint somewhat higher in the air than the highest point of ''Het Kopje'', by Jacob van Ruisdael, c.1665]]
[[File:Jacob van Ruisdael - Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem.jpg|thumb|So-called ''Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem'', actually showing bleaching fields in Heemstede to the south of Haarlem, by Jacob van Ruisdael, 1670s]]
[[File:Cornelis van Noorde - View of the Kleverlaan near Bloemendaal - 1763.jpg|thumb|This watercolor from 1763 by [[Cornelis van Noorde]] shows how high the dunes of Bloemendaal used to be. This is a view of the Kleverlaan from the perspective of the Huis ter Kleef. "Clercq and Beeck", still owned by the De Clercq family a century later, is here on the left.]]
It wasn't until the 1650s that the production of the panoramic views began that were later copied by others. Perhaps the most famous is Ruisdael's view of Haarlem bleaching fields from the north-east, which is why many assumed that all Haerlempjes were painted from the same perspective, not realizing that the entire area is relatively flat and so they were painted from an imaginary point somewhere up in the air, and not from a mountaintop. There is a high dune in [[Bloemendaal]] called ''Het Kopje'' and there used to be a ridge of high dunes in [[Heemstede]] that were later slowly removed by sand-barges for use in building foundations for the mansions in the Amsterdam expansion known today as the [[Canals of Amsterdam]]. On older maps, the ''Sant-vaert'' is clearly marked where such barges once travelled. That canal still exists today and forms the modern border between Haarlem and Heemstede, and is called the ''Crayenestervaart''.

In 1997 [[Pieter Biesboer]] wrote a short article explaining the viewpoints of some of these paintings based on old maps, most notably the ''Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem'' in the collection of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; This painting, despite its title, does not show Haarlem from the north at all, but shows Haarlem from the south, from an imaginary point somewhere above the old dune ridge near the street known as the ''Blekersvaart'' in Heemstede, probably close to the ''Dorstige Kuil'', an inn favored by artists in the 17th century. The church in the painting clearly shows the curved side of the choir on the right rather than the left.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; Biesboer noticed also that this painting displays many more trees, which is logical because the park [[Haarlemmerhout]] is situated there.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;

In the same article a few other paintings are mentioned, including a Ruisdael view of Haarlem bleaching fields in the collection of the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]], which shows the ruins of [[Huis ter Kleef]], also shown from the same perspective in a painting in the [[musée Jacquemart-André]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; He was able to trace the bleachery ''Clercq and Beeck'' situated on the Kleverlaan shown in the right foreground in this painting to one owned by [[Lucas de Clercq]], whose portrait was painted by [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; This scene of Clercq and Beeck was painted again by Ruisdael with some more detail in the version located in the [[Mauritshuis]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The painting from the Mauritshuis is the same view of Beeck and Clercq as the painting in the Rijksmuseum, while the one in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] of the same general view seems between those and the one in Montreal:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Rembrandt 237.jpg|thumb|''The [[Goldweigher's Field]]'', by [[Rembrandt]], 1650-1651]]
Though not all of these panoramic paintings show [[bleachfield]]s, these bleacheries were often also mentioned on maps, and served as easy points of orientation for those looking down on the landscape from high dunes. Possibly some of these paintings were commissioned by the bleacheries themselves for use in Haarlem shops where goods were sold and exchanged. Lucas de Clercq lived in Haarlem during the winter and on his Clercq and Beeck estate in the summer months. Even Rembrandt made a sketch of bleaching fields, though these were only identified as such a few centuries after the fact.

The ''Haerlempjes'' seemed to become popular not only in Haarlem, but were sold everywhere, and even various books were produced containing prints of such views of Haarlem by the Roghman family and others.

'''''Huǒhēiàn''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|火|黑|暗}}}}) is an ancient [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] system of [[aesthetics]] believed to serve as the philosophical [[yin and yang|yang]] to [[fengshui]]'s [[yin and yang|yin]]. It was originally described as an art of only theoretical use, although it was eventually adopted as the ''de facto'' alternative to fengshui.

''Huǒhēiàn'' translate as "fire and darkness" in English. This name refers to a passage from the ''[[Book of Burial]]'' of [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]]:&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Qi vapors in the fire, and is lost in the darkness.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.trinity.edu/sfield/Fengshui/Zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike fengshui, ''huǒhēiàn'' values [[diagonal]] and non-orthogonal arrangements, closed spaces, corners, dim lighting, blocked pathways, and [[Chinese jade|jade]] statuettes of snakes (a trademark of the art).

Early practitioners of the aethetic system were considered cruel, brash, and unpleasing to human tastes in their creations.  However, like the dark [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s of [[Gothic architecture]] (believed by some to be a Western [[analogy]] of sorts), ''huǒhēiàn'' grew to mainstream acceptance at various points in [[Chinese history]]. The mixing of the grandiose and unseen blended to give many a feelings of mystery and [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]].

The art of ''huǒhēiàn'' countermands many of fengshui's stylistic imperatives, such as screen walls facing the main entrance of the house, talismans to ward off evil, and elevated landscapes to the anterior of the house.  Additionally, ''huǒhēiàn'' enjoins against the presence of ponds, pools, wells, or indeed water sources of any kind. In fact, this prohibition was the origin of the now-canonical [[Chinese rock garden]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">'''Kinechromatic art''' is a form of art in which the image, particularly in reference to the colour perceived by the viewer, changes due to some form of movement.

The term "kinechromatic" was coined in 1951 by [[Mario Pedrosa]] in an article in ''[[Tribuna da Imprensa]]'' to refer to the work of Brazilian artist, [[Abraham Palatnik]]. Palatnik initially created [[electro-mechanical]] devices, based on the [[kaleidoscope|kaleidoscopic]] principle, which projected a constantly changing pattern of coloured light on a screen. Later devices exposed coloured moving parts of the machinery. In all cases, the shape and colour observed were changed by the devices for a stationary observer. [[Frank Popper]], the eminent art historian, among others, commented on Palatnik's "luminous mobiles" and their aesthetic of motion.

More recently, the term has been applied to the work of [[Ian Nunn]], a Canadian computer scientist and artist who has done extensive work in the application of [[interference pigments]] and films to 2-dimensional painting surfaces. These special effect pigments, such as [[ChromaFlair]], exhibit strong directional [[spectral reflectance]] and colour shifting with the angle of view. In Nunn's work, the viewer moves while the painting remains stationary. Elements in the picture change colour, appear and disappear as both the angle of viewing and the angle of illumination change.

'''Kinetic art''' is [[art]] from any medium that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or depends on motion for its effect. Canvas [[Painting|paintings]] that extend the viewer's perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement are the earliest examples of kinetic art.&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Popper |title=The Origins and Development of Kinetic Art |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More pertinently speaking, kinetic art is a term that today most often refers to three-dimensional [[sculpture]]s and figures such as [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]] that move naturally or are machine operated (see e. g. videos on this page of works of [[George Rickey]], [[Uli Aschenborn]] and [[Sarnikoff]]). The moving parts are generally powered by wind, a motor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/2/21|author=Liliane Lijn|date=11 June 2018|title=Accepting the Machine: A Response by Liliane Lijn to Three Questions from Arts|publisher=Arts|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the observer.  Kinetic art encompasses a wide variety of overlapping techniques and styles.

There is also a portion of kinetic art that includes virtual movement, or rather movement perceived from only certain angles or sections of the work. This term also clashes frequently with the term "apparent movement", which many people use when referring to an artwork whose movement is created by motors, machines, or electrically powered systems. Both apparent and virtual movement are styles of kinetic art that only recently have been argued as styles of [[op art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Art Online: Kinetic Art |last= |first= |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of overlap between kinetic and [[op art]] is not significant enough for artists and art historians to consider merging the two styles under one umbrella term, but there are distinctions that have yet to be made.

"Kinetic art" as a moniker developed from a number of sources. Kinetic art has its origins in the late 19th century [[Impressionism|impressionist]] artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[Édouard Manet]] who originally experimented with accentuating the movement of human figures on canvas. This triumvirate of [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painters all sought to create art that was more lifelike than their contemporaries. Degas’ dancer and racehorse portraits are examples of what he believed to be "photographic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]";&lt;ref name="Oxford Art Online"&gt;{{cite book |first= |last= |title=Oxford Art Online: Kinetic Art in America |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; artists such as Degas in the late 19th century felt the need to challenge the movement toward [[photography]] with vivid, cadenced [[Landscape|landscapes]] and [[Portrait|portraits]].

By the early 1900s, certain artists grew closer and closer to ascribing their art to dynamic motion.  [[Naum Gabo]], one of the two artists attributed to naming this style, wrote frequently about his work as examples of "kinetic rhythm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kinetics |first=Frank |last=Popper |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that his moving sculpture ''Kinetic Construction'' (also dubbed ''Standing Wave'', 1919–20)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kinetic Art |first=Guy |last=Brett |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of its kind in the 20th century. From the 1920s until the 1960s, the style of kinetic art was reshaped by a number of other artists who experimented with mobiles and new forms of sculpture.

== Origins and early development ==
The strides made by artists to "lift the figures and scenery off the page and prove undeniably that art is not rigid" ([[Alexander Calder|Calder]], 1954)&lt;ref name="Oxford Art Online" /&gt; took significant innovations and changes in compositional style. Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, and Claude Monet were the three artists of the 19th century that initiated those changes in the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]]. Even though they each took unique approaches to incorporating movement in their works, they did so with the intention of being a realist. In the same period, Auguste Rodin was an artist whose early works spoke in support of the developing kinetic movement in art. However, [[Auguste Rodin]]'s later criticisms of the movement indirectly challenged the abilities of Manet, Degas, and Monet, claiming that it is impossible to exactly capture a moment in time and give it the vitality that is seen in real life.

=== Édouard Manet ===
[[File:Edouard Manet The Spanish Ballet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Édouard Manet]], ''Le Ballet Espagnol'' (1862).]]
It is almost impossible to ascribe Manet's work to any one era or style of art. One of his works that is truly on the brink of a new style is ''Le Ballet Espagnol'' (1862).&lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt; The figures' contours coincide with their gestures as a way to suggest depth in relation to one another and in relation to the setting. Manet also accentuates the lack of equilibrium in this work to project to the viewer that he or she is on the edge of a moment that is seconds away from passing. The blurred, hazy sense of color and shadow in this work similarly place the viewer in a fleeting moment.

In 1863, Manet extended his study of movement on flat canvas with ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]''. The light, color, and composition are the same, but he adds a new structure to the background figures. The woman bending in the background is not completely scaled as if she were far away from the figures in the foreground. The lack of spacing is Manet's method of creating snapshot, near-invasive movement similar to his blurring of the foreground objects in ''Le Ballet Espagnol''.

=== Edgar Degas ===
[[File:Edgar Degas - At the Races.jpg|thumb|left|''At the Races'', 1877–1880, oil on canvas, by Edgar Degas, [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]
[[File:Degas - Orchester in der Oper.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edgar Degas]], ''L'Orchestre de L'Opera'' (1868)]]
Edgar Degas is believed to be the intellectual extension of Manet, but more radical for the impressionist community. Degas' subjects are the epitome of the impressionist era; he finds great inspiration in images of ballet dancers and horse races. His "modern subjects" &lt;ref name="Kepes"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gyorgry |last=Kepes |title=The Nature and Art of Motion |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; never obscured his objective of creating moving art. In his 1860 piece ''Jeunes Spartiates s'exerçant à la lutte'', he capitalizes on the classic impressionist nudes but expands on the overall concept. He places them in a flat landscape and gives them dramatic gestures, and for him this pointed to a new theme of "youth in movement".&lt;ref name="Malina"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank J. |last=Malina |title=Kinetic Art: Theory and Practice |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his most revolutionary works, ''L’Orchestre de l’Opéra'' (1868) interprets forms of definite movement and gives them multidimensional movement beyond the flatness of the canvas. He positions the orchestra directly in the viewer’s space, while the dancers completely fill the background. Degas is alluding to the Impressionist style of combining movement, but almost redefines it in a way that was seldom seen in the late 1800s. In the 1870s, Degas continues this trend through his love of one shot motion horseraces in such works as ''Voiture aux Courses'' (1872).

It wasn’t until 1884 with ''Chevaux de Course'' that his attempt at creating dynamic art came to fruition. This work is part of a series of horse races and polo matches wherein the figures are well integrated into the landscape. The horses and their owners are depicted as if caught in a moment of intense deliberation, and then trotting away casually in other frames. The impressionist and overall artistic community were very impressed with this series, but were also shocked when they realized he based this series on actual photographs. Degas was not fazed by the criticisms of his integration of photography, and it actually inspired Monet to rely on similar technology.

=== Claude Monet ===
[[File:Claude Monet Le bateau atelier.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''Atelier sur Seine'' (1876)]]
Degas and Monet's style was very similar in one way: both of them based their artistic interpretation on a direct "retinal impression" &lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt; to create the feeling of variation and movement in their art. The subjects or images that were the foundation of their paintings came from an objective view of the world. As with Degas, many art historians consider that to be the subconscious effect photography had in that period of time. His 1860s works reflected many of the signs of movement that are visible in Degas' and Manet's work.

By 1875, Monet's touch becomes very swift in his new series, beginning with ''Le Bâteau-Atelier sur la Seine''. The landscape almost engulfs the whole canvas and has enough motion emanating from its inexact brushstrokes that the figures are a part of the motion. This painting along with ''Gare Saint-Lazare'' (1877-1878), proves to many art historians that Monet was redefining the style of the Impressionist era. Impressionism initially was defined by isolating color, light, and movement.&lt;ref name="Kepes" /&gt; In the late 1870s, Monet had pioneered a style that combined all three, while maintaining a focus on the popular subjects of the Impressionist era. Artists were often so struck by Monet's wispy brushstrokes that it was more than movement in his paintings, but a ''striking vibration''.&lt;ref name="Roukes"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicholas |last=Roukes |title=Plastics for Kinetic Art|publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Auguste Rodin]]===
Auguste Rodin at first was very impressed by Monet's 'vibrating works' and Degas' unique understanding of spatial relationships. As an artist and an author of art reviews, Rodin published multiple works supporting this style. He claimed that Monet and Degas' work created the illusion "that art captures life through good modeling and movement".&lt;ref name="Roukes" /&gt; In 1881, when Rodin first sculpted and produced his own works of art, he rejected his earlier notions. Sculpting put Rodin into a predicament that he felt no philosopher nor anyone could ever solve; how can artists impart movement and dramatic motions from works so solid as sculptures? After this conundrum occurred to him, he published new articles that didn't attack men such as Manet, Monet, and Degas intentionally, but propagated his own theories that Impressionism is not about communicating movement but presenting it in static form.

== 20th century surrealism and early kinetic art ==
The [[Surrealism|surrealist style]] of the 20th century created an easy transition into the style of kinetic art. All artists now explored subject matter that would not have been socially acceptable to depict artistically. Artists went beyond solely painting landscapes or historical events, and felt the need to delve into the mundane and the extreme to interpret new styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Plastic Art |first=Carola |last=Giedion-Welcker |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of artists such as [[Albert Gleizes]], other [[avant-garde]] artists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Max Bill]] felt as if they had found new inspiration to discover oddities that became the focus of kinetic art.

=== Albert Gleizes ===
Gleizes was considered the ideal philosopher of the late 19th century and early 20th century arts in Europe, and more specifically France. His theories and treatises from 1912 on [[cubism]] gave him a renowned reputation in any artistic discussion. This reputation is what allowed him to act with considerable influence when supporting the plastic style or the rhythmic movement of art in the 1910s and 1920s. Gleizes published a theory on movement, which further articulated his theories on the psychological, artistic uses of movement in conjunction with the mentality that arises when considering movement. Gleizes asserted repeatedly in his publications that human creation implies the total renunciation of external sensation.&lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt; That to him is what made art mobile when to many, including Rodin, it was rigidly and unflinchingly immobile.

Gleizes first stressed the necessity for rhythm in art. To him, rhythm meant the visually pleasant coinciding of figures in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. Figures should be spaced mathematically, or systematically so that they appeared to interact with one another. Figures should also not have features that are too definite. They need to have shapes and compositions that are almost unclear, and from there the viewer can believe that the figures themselves are moving in that confined space. He wanted paintings, sculptures, and even the flat works of mid-19th-century artists to show how figures could impart on the viewer that there was great movement contained in a certain space. As a philosopher, Gleizes also studied the concept of artistic movement and how that appealed to the viewer. Gleizes updated his studies and publications through the 1930s, just as kinetic art was becoming popular.

=== Jackson Pollock ===
When [[Jackson Pollock]] created many of his famous works, the United States was already at the forefront of the kinetic art movement. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The novel styles and methods he used to create his most famous pieces earned him the spot in the 1950s as the unchallenged leader of [[action painting|kinetic painters]], his work was associated with [[Action painting]] coined by [[art critic]] [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the 1950s. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Pollock had an unfettered desire to animate every aspect of his paintings. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Pollock repeatedly said to himself, "I am in every painting".&lt;ref name="Malina" /&gt; He used tools that most painters would never use, such as sticks, trowels, and knives. The shapes he created were what he thought was ''"beautiful, erratic objects"''.&lt;ref name="Malina" /&gt;

This style evolved into his drip technique. Pollock repeatedly took buckets of paint and paintbrushes and flicked them around until the canvas was covered with squiggly lines and jagged strokes. In the next phase of his work, Pollock tested his style with uncommon materials. He painted his first work with aluminum paint in 1947, titled ''Cathedral'' and from there he tried his first "splashes" to destroy the unity of the material itself. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} He believed wholeheartedly that he was liberating the materials and structure of art from their forced confinements, and that is how he arrived at the moving or kinetic art that always existed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

{{clear}}

=== Max Bill ===
[[Max Bill]] became an almost complete disciple of the kinetic movement in the 1930s. He believed that kinetic art should be executed from a purely mathematical perspective. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} To him, using mathematics principles and understandings were one of the few ways that you could create objective movement. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This theory applied to every artwork he created and how he created it. Bronze, marble, copper, and brass were four of the materials he used in his sculptures. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} He also enjoyed tricking the viewer’s eye when he or she first approached one of his sculptures. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} In his ''Construction with Suspended Cube'' (1935-1936) he created a mobile sculpture that generally appears to have perfect symmetry, but once the viewer glances at it from a different angle, there are aspects of asymmetry. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Mobiles and sculpture==
Max Bill’s sculptures were only the beginning of the style of movement that kinetic explored. Tatlin, Rodchenko, and Calder especially took the stationary sculptures of the early 20th century and gave them the slightest freedom of motion. These three artists began with testing unpredictable movement, and from there tried to control the movement of their figures with technological enhancements. The term "mobile" comes from the ability to modify how gravity and other atmospheric conditions affect the artist’s work.&lt;ref name="Kepes" /&gt;

Although there is very little distinction between the styles of mobiles in kinetic art, there is one distinction that can be made. Mobiles are no longer considered mobiles when the spectator has control over their movement. This is one of the features of virtual movement. When the piece only moves under certain circumstances that are not natural, or when the spectator controls the movement even slightly, the figure operates under virtual movement.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Kinetic art principles have also influenced [[mosaic]] art. For instance, kinetic-influenced mosaic pieces often use clear distinctions between bright and dark tiles, with three-dimensional shape, to create apparent shadows and movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menhem|first1=Chantal|title=Kinetic Mosaics: The Art of Movement|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/kinetic-mosaics-the-art-of-movement/|website=Mozaico|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vladimir Tatlin ===
[[Vladimir Tatlin]] is considered by many artists and art historians {{who|date=March 2013}} to be the first person to ever complete a [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile sculpture]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The term mobile wasn't coined until Rodchenko's time, {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} but is very applicable to Tatlin's work. His mobile is a series of suspended reliefs that only need a wall or a pedestal, and it would forever stay suspended. This early mobile, ''Contre-Reliefs Libérés Dans L'espace'' (1915) is judged as an incomplete work. It was a rhythm, much similar to the rhythmic styles of Pollock, that relied on the mathematical interlocking of planes that created a work freely suspended in air. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Tatlin never felt that his art was an object or a product that needed a clear beginning or a clear end. He felt above anything that his work was an evolving process. Many artists whom he befriended considered the mobile truly complete in 1936, but he disagreed vehemently. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Alexander Rodchenko ===
[[File:1915 Dance by Rodchenko.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Alexander Rodchenko ''Dance. An Objectless Composition'', 1915]]
[[Alexander Rodchenko]], one of Tatlin’s friends who insisted his work was complete, continued the study of suspended mobiles and created what he deemed to be "non-objectivism".&lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt; This style was a study less focused on mobiles than on canvas paintings and objects that were immoveable. It focuses on juxtaposing objects of different materials and textures as a way to spark new ideas in the mind of the viewer. By creating discontinuity with the work, the viewer assumed that the figure was moving off the canvas or the medium to which it was restricted. One of his canvas works titled ''Dance, an Objectless Composition'' (1915) embodies that desire to place items and shapes of different textures and materials together to create an image that drew in the viewer’s focus.

However, by the 1920s and 1930s, Rodchenko found a way to incorporate his theories of non-objectivism in mobile study. His 1920 piece ''Hanging Construction'' is a wood mobile that hangs from any ceiling by a string and rotates naturally. This mobile sculpture has concentric circles that exist in several planes, but the entire sculpture only rotates horizontally and vertically.

=== Alexander Calder ===
[[File:Calder-redmobile.jpg|thumb|300px|Alexander Calder, ''Red Mobile,'' 1956, Painted sheet metal and metal rods, a signature work - [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]]]
[[Alexander Calder]] is an artist who many believe to have defined firmly and exactly the style of mobiles in kinetic art. Over years of studying his works, many critics allege that Calder was influenced by a wide variety of sources. Some claim that Chinese windbells were objects that closely resembled the shape and height of his earliest mobiles. Other art historians argue that the 1920s mobiles of [[Man Ray]], including ''Shade'' (1920) had a direct influence on the growth of Calder’s art.

When Calder first heard of these claims, he immediately admonished his critics. "I have never been and never will be a product of anything more than myself. My art is my own, why bother stating something about my art that isn’t true?"&lt;ref name="Malina" /&gt; One of Calder’s first mobiles, ''Mobile'' (1938) was the work that "proved" to many art historians that Man Ray had an obvious influence on Calder’s style. Both ''Shade'' and ''Mobile'' have a single string attached to a wall or a structure that keeps it in the air. The two works have a crinkled feature that vibrates when air passes through it.

Regardless of the obvious similarities, Calder’s style of mobiles created two types that are now referred to as the standard in kinetic art. There are object-mobiles and suspended mobiles. Object mobiles on supports come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, and can move in any way. Suspended mobiles were first made with colored glass and small wooden objects that hung on long threads. Object mobiles were a part of Calder’s emerging style of mobiles that were originally stationary sculptures.

It can be argued, based on their similar shape and stance, that Calder’s earliest object mobiles have very little to do with kinetic art or moving art. By the 1960s, most art critics believed that Calder had perfected the style of object mobiles in such creations as the ''Cat Mobile'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calder |first1=Ugo |last1=Mulas |first2=H. Harvard |last2=Arnason |others=with comments by Alexander Calder |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this piece, Calder allows the cat’s head and its tail to be subject to random motion, but its body is stationary. Calder did not start the trend in suspended mobiles, but he was the artist that became recognized for his apparent originality in mobile construction.

One of his earliest suspended mobiles, ''McCausland Mobile'' (1933),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  |title=Alexander Calder 
  |first=Joan M. |last=Marter 
  |authorlink=Joan Marter
  |publisher= 
  |year= 
  |isbn= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is different from many other contemporary mobiles simply because of the shapes of the two objects. Most mobile artists such as Rodchenko and Tatlin would never have thought to use such shapes because they didn’t seem malleable or even remotely aerodynamic.

Despite the fact that Calder did not divulge most of the methods he used when creating his work, he admitted that he used mathematical relationships to make them. He only said that he created a balanced mobile by using direct variation proportions of weight and distance. Calder’s formulas changed with every new mobile he made, so other artists could never precisely imitate the work.

== Virtual movement ==
By the 1940s, new styles of mobiles as well as many types of sculpture and paintings incorporated the control of the spectator. Artists such as Calder, Tatlin, and Rodchenko produced more art through the 1960s, but they were also competing against other artists who appealed to different audiences. When artists such as [[Victor Vasarely]] developed a number of the first features of virtual movement in their art, kinetic art faced heavy criticism. This criticism lingered for years until the 1960s, when kinetic art was in a dormant period.

=== Materials and electricity ===
Vasarely created many works that were considered to be interactive in the 1940s. One of his works ''Gordes/Cristal'' (1946) is a series of cubic figures that are also electrically powered. When he first showed these figures at fairs and art exhibitions, he invited people up to the cubic shapes to press the switch and start the color and light show. Virtual movement is a style of kinetic art that can be associated with mobiles, but from this style of movement there are two more specific distinctions of kinetic art.

== Apparent movement and op art ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2017}}
Apparent movement is a term ascribed to kinetic art that evolved only in the 1950s. Art historians believed that any type of kinetic art that was mobile independent of the viewer has apparent movement. This style includes works that range from Pollock’s drip technique all the way to Tatlin’s first mobile. By the 1960s, other art historians developed the phrase "[[op art]]" to refer to optical illusions and all optically stimulating art that was on canvas or stationary. This phrase often clashes with certain aspects of kinetic art that include mobiles that are generally stationary.&lt;ref name="BRITTANICA"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/Op-art Encyclopaedia Britannica - op art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="POMPIDOU"&gt;[http://mediation.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-cinetisme/ENS-cinetique.html Centre Georges Pompidou, Kinetic Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, for the exhibition ''Mouvements'' at the [[Denise René]] gallery in Paris, Victor Vasarely and [[Pontus Hulten]] promoted in their "Yellow manifesto" some new kinetic expressions based on optical and luminous phenomenon as well as painting illusionism. The expression "kinetic art" in this modern form first appeared at the [[Museum für Gestaltung]] of [[Zürich]] in 1960, and found its major developments in the 1960s. In most European countries, it generally included the form of optical art that mainly makes use of [[optical illusion]]s, such as [[op art]], represented by [[Bridget Riley]], as well as art based on movement represented by [[Yacov Agam]], [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]], [[Jesús Rafael Soto]], [[Gregorio Vardanega]], or [[Nicolas Schöffer]]. From 1961 to 1968, [[Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel|GRAV]] (''Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel'') founded by [[François Morellet]],  [[Julio Le Parc]], [[Francisco Sobrino]], [[Horacio Garcia Rossi]], [[Yvaral]], [[Joël Stein]] and [[Vera Molnár]] was a collective group of opto-kinetic artists. According to its 1963 manifesto, GRAV appealed to the direct participation of the public with an influence on its behavior, notably through the use of interactive [[labyrinth]]s.

==Contemporary work==
In November 2013, the [[MIT Museum]] opened ''5000 Moving Parts'', an exhibition of kinetic art, featuring the work of [[Arthur Ganson]], [[Anne Lilly]], [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]], [[John Douglas Powers]], and [[Takis]].  The exhibition inaugurates a "year of kinetic art" at the Museum, featuring special programming related to the artform.&lt;ref name=5000MP&gt;{{cite web|title=5000 Moving Parts|url=http://web.mit.edu/museum/exhibitions/5000.html|work=MIT Museum|publisher=MIT Museum|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-kinetic{{clarify|date=August 2017}} art has been popular in China where you can find interactive kinetic sculptures in many public places, including Wuhu International Sculpture Park and in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gschwend|first1=Ralfonso|title=The Development of Public Art and its Future Passive, Active and Interactive Past, Present and Future|journal=Arts|date=22 July 2015|volume=4|issue=3|pages=93–100|doi=10.3390/arts4030093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krip-Hop''' is a movement demonstrating alternate arrangements by which [[hip hop]] artists with disabilities can communicate through social media, including [[Education|educators]],  [[journalist]]s and conferences. The movement uses hip hop music as a means of expression for the disabled, providing them an opportunity to share their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choy|first1=Allie|date=February 12, 2012|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues|title=Krip-hop nation uses hip-hop to expose disability issues}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Not History}}History==
Krip Hop was founded by [[Leroy F. Moore Jr.]], an African American writer, [[poet]], community [[Activism|activist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] who was diagnosed with [[cerebral palsy]]. Moore was born in New York in 1967 to an activist father loosely connected to the Black Panthers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydayabolition.com/2013/02/23/leroy-moore/|title=Interview with Leroy Moore |publisher=Everyday Abolition/Abolition Every Day |date=February 23, 2013 |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His upbringing sensitized Moore to the challenges faced by African Americans and the disabled.&lt;ref name="amoeba"/&gt; As a youth, Moore discovered that most people had little knowledge of the historical impact of disabled African Americans. This led him to begin research, initially in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amoeba.com/blog/2008/07/jamoeblog/krip-hop-project-s-leroy-f-moore-on-being-black-disabled.html |title=Krip-Hop Project's Leroy F Moore On Being Black &amp; Disabled |publisher=The Amoeblog |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore first spotlighted disabled hip hop artists in the early 2000s. He co-produced and co-hosted a three-part series on what he called "Krip Hop" for a Berkeley, California radio station. The "Krip Hop" series appeared on [[KPFA]]'s ''Pushing Limits'', which focuses on news, arts, and culture for the disabled community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hix |first=Lisa |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/performance/article.jsp?essid=43903 |title=Interview with Leroy Moore, Founder of Krip Hop Nation |publisher=KQED Public Media |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' popularity inspired Moore to create Krip Hop Nation for disabled musicians, since little cultural work or music by people with disabilities had been recognized.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reverb"/&gt; "The Krip-Hop movement really makes the pain of the people feel visible", Moore said. "It goes a lot deeper than what people can see."&lt;ref name="uwdaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues#.UoBI-ZTF1mk |work=The Daily |publisher=University of Washington |author=Allie Choy |date=12 February 2012 |title=Krip-Hop Nation uses hip-hop to expose disability issues |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111040926/http://dailyuw.com/archive/2012/02/12/news/krip-hop-nation-uses-hip-hop-expose-disability-issues |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Krip Hop Nation==
The primary goal of Krip Hop Nation is to increase awareness in music and media outlets of the talents, history and rights of people with disabilities in the hip-hop industry. In an interview, Moore expressed the hope that by listening to his music the audience would understand the need to question authority and the information provided to them. He said he wanted his listeners to learn about their community and to become open to all people. Issues such as racism and sexism are commonly discussed, and Moore hoped that people would examine possible [[ableism]] in their attitudes.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt; According to Moore, Krip Hop Nation goes beyond producing music and the [[bling-bling]] associated with hip hop; the movement is about advocacy, education and overcoming oppression. For Moore the movement has sought to reclaim negative terms associated with the disabled (such as "crazy", "lame", "retarded" and "cripple"), using them to shock people into understanding and respecting the disabled African American community.&lt;ref name="wordgathering"/&gt; Krip Hop Nation addresses discrimination against disabled artists in hip hop by publishing articles and hosting events, lectures and workshops. It has over 300 members worldwide.&lt;ref name="wordgathering"/&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is self-published.|date=March 2015}}

Moore has explained that "Krip Hop" is a play on "Hip Hop." Although the "Krip" part of the name refers to "crippled", it is spelled with a "k" to avoid association with the [[Crips]].&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Krip Hop Nation has released two mixtape CDs, held conferences with the PeaceOut HomoHop organization at UC Berkeley and New York University, organized and hosted a six-artist performance in Sacramento, California,&lt;ref&gt;[http://poormagazine.org/node/4655 2011 End of the Year Accomplishments.] Accessed 31 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; staged a show at Disability and Deaf Arts (DADA) in [[Liverpool]] and hosted a Krip Hop Nation conference in Atlanta, Georgia for [[Black History Month]] in 2011 featuring musicians, writers and activists.&lt;ref name="kqed"/&gt;

In February 2012, DJ Quad of 5th Battalion joined Krip Hop Nation to co-produce a CD with 17 disabled artists from the UK, the US and Germany on police brutality and profiling. Among the collaborators was Emmitt Thrower of Artist Magnet. The documentary was scheuled for release in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leroy |url=http://poormagazine.org/node/4655 |title=Krip-Hop Nation End of the Year Accomplishments 2012 |publisher=POOR Magazine/Prensa POBRE |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable musicians==
Krip Hop Nation includes artists such as Counterclockwise, Preach-man, Wheelchair Sports Camp, Miss Money and Fezo.&lt;ref name="wheres-lulu"/&gt; [[Kalyn Heffernan]] is a rapper from [[Denver]], Colorado. With [[Osteogenesis imperfecta|brittle bone disease]], Heffernan is {{convert|3|ft|6|in|cm}} tall and uses a wheelchair. She heads Wheelchair Sports Camp, an experimental hip-hop group with jazz and avant-garde influences. Her raps are political, with many discussing the difficulties she faces as a disabled person in America. Heffernan created beats for Haitian rappers in the area dealing with extreme poverty after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gentile |first=Joseph |url=https://www.vice.com/read/everyone-in-this-wheelchair-sports-camp-is-stoned-and-making-beats |title=Everyone in This Wheelchair Sports Camp Is Stoned and Making Beats |publisher=Vice |date=2013-12-05 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 she was arrested after a 3-day sitdown protest at her GOP Senator's office, remarking "I'd rather go to jail than to die without [[Medicaid]]" in regards to [[Trumpcare]]. &lt;ref name="Heffernan Trumpcare Arrest"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/leahmcelrath/status/880782432064110592 |title=Heffernan Trumpcare Arrest |last=Leah McElrath   |first=Leah |date=2017-07-01 |website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a trend "Land art" expanded boundaries of art by the materials used and the siting of the works. The materials used were often the materials of the Earth including for instance the soil and rocks and vegetation and water found on-site, and the siting of the works were often distant from population centers. Though sometimes fairly inaccessible, photo documentation was commonly brought back to the urban art gallery.&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mymodernmet.com/andy-goldsworthy-land-art/ http://mymodernmet.com] Unexpected Land Art Beautifully Formed in Nature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la"&gt;[http://www.land-arts.com/Land_art.html http://www.land-arts.com] Land art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns of the art movement centered around rejection of the commercialization of art-making and enthusiasm with an emergent ecological movement. The art movement coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living and its counterpart, an enthusiasm for that which is rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet [[Earth]] as home to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;ArtSpeak, A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present, By Robert Atkins, Abbeville Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-78921-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Micucci"&gt;[http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/04/land-art-earthworks-postwar-american-art/ Dana Micucci, ''Land Art: Earthworks that Defined Postwar American Art'', Art &amp; Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s land art protested "ruthless commercialization" of art in [[United States|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Natural Art|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XAn5hztDTggC|publisher = PediaPress}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, exponents of land art rejected the [[museum]] or [[Art museum|gallery]] as the setting of artistic activity and developed monumental landscape projects which were beyond the reach of traditional transportable [[sculpture]] and the commercial art market, although photographic documentation was often presented in normal gallery spaces. Land art was inspired by [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimal art]] and [[conceptual art]] but also by modern movements such as [[De Stijl]], [[Cubism]], [[minimalism]] and the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Joseph Beuys]]. Many of the artists associated with land art had been involved with minimal art and [[conceptual art]]. [[Isamu Noguchi]]'s 1941 design for ''Contoured Playground'' in New York is sometimes interpreted as an important early piece of land art even though the artist himself never called his work "land art" but simply "sculpture". His influence on contemporary land art, [[landscape architecture]] and [[environmental sculpture]] is evident in many works today.&lt;ref name="Weilacher"&gt;Udo Weilacher, ''Between Landscape Architecture and Land Art''. Birkhäuser, 1999, Basel Berlin Boston 1999 {{ISBN|3-7643-6119-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Sonfist]] used an alternative approach to working with [[nature]] and [[culture]] by bringing historical nature and [[sustainable art]] back into New York City. His most inspirational work is ''Time Landscape'', an indigenous forest he planted in New York City.&lt;ref name="Weilacher" /&gt; He also created several other ''Time Landscapes'' around the world such as ''Circles of Time'' in Florence Italy documenting the historical usage of the land, and recently at the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum outside Boston. According to critic [[Barbara Rose]], writing in ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969, he had become disillusioned with the commodification and insularity of gallery bound art. In 1967, the [[art critic]] Grace Glueck writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared the first earthwork was done by Douglas Leichter and Richard Saba at the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]]. The sudden appearance of land art in 1968 can be located as a response by a generation of artists mostly in their late twenties to the heightened political activism of the year and the emerging [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[women's liberation]] [[Social movement|movement]]s.

One example of land art in the 20th century was a group exhibition created in 1968 at the Dwan Gallery &lt;!--"Dwan" is not a typo--&gt; in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/earthworks.html|title=Leftmatrix|publisher=leftmatrix.com|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1969, [[Willoughby Sharp]] curated the "Earth Art" exhibition at the [[Andrew Dickson White House|Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, New York. The artists included were [[Walter De Maria]], [[Jan Dibbets]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Neil Jenney]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[David Medalla]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Robert Smithson]], and [[Gunther Uecker]]. The exhibition was directed by Thomas W. Leavitt. Gordon Matta-Clark, who lived in Ithaca at the time, was invited by Sharp to help the artists in "Earth Art" with the on-site execution of their works for the exhibition.

Perhaps the best known artist who worked in this genre was the [[United States|American]] [[Robert Smithson]] whose 1968 essay "The Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects" provided a critical framework for the movement as a reaction to the disengagement of [[Modernism]] from social issues as represented by the critic [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QTq8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22land+art%22,+%22Clement+Greenberg%22,+smithson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP-sP09dPUAhXFKFAKHdrfB9oQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22land%20art%22%2C%20%22Clement%20Greenberg%22%2C%20smithson&amp;f=false Francis Frascina, ''Art, Politics and Dissent: Aspects of the Art Left in Sixties America''], Manchester University Press, 1999, p. 142, {{ISBN|0719044693}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best known piece, and probably the most famous piece of all land art, is the ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' (1970), for which Smithson arranged rock, earth and [[algae]] so as to form a long (1500&amp;nbsp;ft) spiral-shape [[jetty]] protruding into [[Great Salt Lake]] in northern [[Utah]], [[United States|U.S.]]. How much of the work, if any, is visible is dependent on the fluctuating water levels. Since its creation, the work has been completely covered, and then uncovered again, by water.

Utah Museum of Fine Arts. umfa.utah.org. July&amp;nbsp;30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson's ''Gravel Mirror with Cracks and Dust'' (1968) is an example of land art existing in a [[art gallery|gallery]] space rather than in the natural environment. It consists of a pile of gravel by the side of a partially mirrored gallery wall. In its simplicity of form and concentration on the materials themselves, this and other pieces of land art have an affinity with [[minimalism]]. There is also a relationship to [[Arte Povera]] in the use of materials traditionally considered "unartistic" or "worthless". The Italian Germano Celant, founder of Arte Povera, was one of the first curator to promote Land Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obsart.blogspot.fr/2012/05/conceptual-art-arte-povera-land-art-it.html|title=Observatoire du Land Art|publisher=obsart.blogspot.fr|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Land Artists' have tended to be American,&lt;ref name="Kastner" /&gt; with other prominent artists in this field including, [[Carl Andre]], [[Alice Aycock]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Ana Mendieta]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]], [[Charles Ross (artist)|Charles Ross]], [[Alan Sonfist]], and [[James Turrell]]. Turrell began work in 1972 on possibly the largest piece of land art thus far, reshaping the earth surrounding the extinct [[Roden Crater]] [[volcano]] in [[Arizona]]. Perhaps the most prominent non-American land artists are the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Chris Drury (artist)|Chris Drury]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] and the Australian [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daringdesigns.com/earthworks.htm|title=Monumental Land Art of the United States|publisher=daringdesigns.com|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1973 [[Jacek Tylicki]] begins to lay out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.

Some projects by the artists [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] (who are famous for wrapping monuments, buildings and landscapes in [[textile|fabric]]) have also been considered land art by some, though the artists themselves consider this incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030208060629/http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-02-08|title=Common Errors|authors=Christo and Jeanne-Claude|publisher=Christojeanneclaude.net|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Beuys]]' concept of '[[social sculpture]]' influenced 'Land art' and his '[[7000 Eichen]]' project of 1982 to plant 7000 Oak trees has many similarities to 'Land art' processes. [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Rogers]]' “Rhythms of Life” project is the largest contemporary land-art undertaking in the world, forming a chain of stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe – 12 sites – in disparate exotic locations (from below sea level and up to altitudes of 4,300 m/14,107&amp;nbsp;ft). Up to three geoglyphs (ranging in size up to 40,000 sq m/430,560 sq ft) are located in each site.

Eduardo Sanguinetti, the Latino-American philosopher and land-artist, presented in 1979 his "Sculptures in Earth". They were placed in natural spaces, they became functional as plants and animals made their homes in that particular topos installed in the La Pampa desert. Later, they acquired the noise of codes capable of classifying smells and colours, and will complete the original idea of our artist, who was at that time absorbed by the countryside and its specular radiation...in his Land-Art Performance "Solum" (1987), in the zoomorphy of that horse that greatly seduce the audience of the [[Centro Cultural Recoleta]] (ex Centro Cultural Ciudad de Buenos Aires). "Amarillo Total" the name of the horse, not only stopped the ecologic blow but also paraded the models who had been completely painted by our artist, their naked painted bodies put another body to painting, with artesan colours prepared with earth and plants pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Espartaco Carlos 1989, "Eduardo Sanguinetti: The Experience of Limits" pp. 86, 87 (Ediciones de Arte Gaglianone, first published 1989) {{ISBN|950-9004-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Sanguinetti's Essay "Alter Ego" (1986), he said: "Spontaneous Activity in Nature...In nature, there is a type of spontaneous activity. This concept does not exist in cultured man, and if it does remain in children, it is like a faint reminiscence of the primitive mind...Consequently I think that the survival of an awareness of the supernatural in nature, should, in all works of Land-Art, be the thing which "animates Everything".&lt;ref&gt;Sanguinetti Eduardo 1984, "Alter Ego" pag. 53, 54 (Pentland, Edinburgh, First Published in 1986 in the English languaje translated from the Spanish in 1986) {{ISBN|9780946270170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prTwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;dq=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5FbBUNXSI-610AGY44DoCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw |title=Alter ego - Eduardo Sanguinetti - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.ar |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land artists in America relied mostly on wealthy [[patron]]s and [[private foundation]]s to fund their often costly projects. With the sudden economic down turn of the mid-1970s funds from these sources largely stopped. With the death of Robert Smithson in a plane crash in 1973 the movement lost one of its most important figureheads and faded out. Charles Ross continues to work on the Star Axis project, which he began in 1971. Michael Heizer continues his work on [[City (artwork)|City]], and James Turrell continues to work on the [[Roden Crater]] project. In most respects, "land art" has become part of mainstream [[public art]] and in many cases the term "land art" is misused to label any kind of art in nature even though conceptually not related to the [[avant-garde]] works by the pioneers of land art.

The Earth art of the 1960s were sometimes reminiscent the much older land works, [[Stonehenge]], the [[Pyramids]], [[Mound Builders|Native American mounds]], the [[Nazca Lines|Nazca Lines in Peru]], [[Carnac stones]] and [[List of burial mounds in the United States|Native American burial grounds]], and often evoked the spirituality of such archeological sites.&lt;ref name="Micucci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16652">[[Charles-Auguste Lebourg]] was a French sculptor born in [[Nantes]] in 1829. He died in Paris in 1906. This is a listing of his main works.

==Main works==
These are listed below.

==Paris' Hôtel de ville==
In 1881, Lebourg executed an allegory of Nantes as part of the town hall's decoration.&lt;ref name=wkp/&gt;

=="Travail"==
Lebourg executed the bronze statue '''"Travail"''' for the École Diderot.&lt;ref name=wkp/&gt; It was shown at the 1885 Paris Salon and the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]].&lt;ref name=wkp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikiphidias.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=481:lebourg-charles-auguste&amp;catid=34:biographie&amp;Itemid=53#Synthèse|title=Biographical details|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leveilleurdenuit.pagesperso-orange.fr/|title=école Diderot|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bust of Richard Wallace, Fourth Marquess of Hertford and Lady Wallace==
[[Image:Charles Lebourg - buste de Mme Wallace.jpg|Bust of Lady Wallace|thumb|centre|200px|Lady Wallace]]
In 1872 Lebourg completed a posthumous bust in white marble based on a photograph of the Wallaces by Étienne Corjat of 1855. His white marble bust of Lady Wallace shown here was exhibited at the Paris salon in May 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisburn.com/books/historical_society/volume8/volume8-8.html

=="Berger lisant"==
[[File:Statue Fontainebleau Charles Le Bourg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marble statue "Berger lisant" by Charles-Auguste Lebourg (French sculptor, 1829-1906), in a niche of the wing of the "Galerie des Cerfs", Château de Fontainebleau]]

|title=Berger lisant|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Louvre==
Lebourg has three of his sculptures decorating parts of the outside of the Louvre. The Mollien Pavilion and the Ailes Mollien (an "aile" is a wing) is part of the cour Napoléon and is named after a Treasury minister at the time of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] ([[Nicolas François, Count Mollien]]) and Lebourg's '''"La Chasse"''' is one of the group of children decorating what is known as the "aile en retour Mollien". The second of Lebourg's sculptures can be seen in the Richelieu pavilion where the tympanum of the arcade of the passage leading to the rue de Rivoli is decorated with Lebourg's bas relief '''"Vérite et Histoire"'''. The third sculpture, again part of the cour Napoléon, decorates the Apollon rotunda and is entitled '''"La Force"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louvre.sculpturederue.fr/index.html

|title=La Chasse|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Wallace Fountains]]==
Lebourg is arguably best known for his [[caryatid]]s for the famous cast-iron [[Wallace fountain]], a public drinking fountain seen all over France and in many parts of the world. They are named after the Englishman Richard Wallace, who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the Wallace Collection in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford. The caryatids depict '''"La Simplicité"''', '''"La Bonté"''', '''"La Sobriété"''' and '''"La Charite"''' as shown below.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Monument to the men of [[Loire-Inférieure]] who died in the 1870 war==
[[File:Nantes - Monum morts 1870 05.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Lemborg's Infantryman ("Le Fantassin") stands between Henri Émile Allouard.s " "Le Fusilier colonial" and Louis-Auguste Baralis' "Le Marin"]]
This monument stands in [[Nantes]]'s Place Duchesse-Anne. Four sculptors worked on the monument, Georges Bareau, Charles-Auguste Lebourg, Henri Émile Allouard and Louis-Auguste Baralis. Lebourg's contribution was the statue of the infantryman. The monument was erected in 1897 and the inauguration ceremony in April of that year was attended by [[Félix Faure]], Jules Méline, Louis Barthou, Admiral Armand Besnard and Hippolyte-Étienne Étiennez the Nantes mayor. The bronze at the monument's summit, entitled '''"Pour le drapeau"''' was by Georges Bareau and had been cast in bronze by Barbedienne. It depicted a man slaying an eagle and at the monuments base were '''"le Fantassin"''' by Lebourg, '''"le Marin"''' by Louis Baralis, '''"l’Artilleur"''' by Émile Allouard and '''"Le Fusilier colonial"''' also by Allouard. In 1940 the occupying Germans dismantled the bronze believing that the slain eagle could be construed as representing the German eagle but the municipal workers of Nantes delegated to carry out the dismantlement managed to hide the sculpture, so stopping it being melted down. The work was retrieved in 1981, restored and re-erected in 1987.

'''Macaroni art''', sometimes referred to as '''macaroni crafts''' or '''pasta art''', is artwork that is made of dry [[macaroni]] or [[List of pasta|other pasta]].&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parents.com/fun/arts-crafts/kid/pasta-crafts/|title=Use Your Noodle: 6 Crafts to Make with Pasta|publisher=parents.com|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works commonly consist of individual pieces of macaroni glued to a surface to produce a [[mosaic]]. However, works may take the form of sculptures.

This type of art is produced during arts and crafts classes at pre-school.&lt;ref name="artistshelpingchildren"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistshelpingchildren.org/pastacraftsideasactivitieskids.html|title=Pasta Crafts for Kids: Ideas for Arts and Crafts Activities with Spaghetti &amp; Macaroni Noodles for Toddlers, Children, and Preschoolers|publisher=artistshelpingchildren.org|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it has evolved to become an artform practiced by adults.{{Citation needed|reason=Questionable|date=November 2017}}

==In popular culture==
Pasta art was used to advertise a [[Nancy Sinatra]] concert at the world famous [[Fillmore West|Fillmore Auditorium]] in San Francisco. The art the poster was made from is composed entirely of ''Pasta e Fagioli'' (pasta and beans). Alphabet pasta spells out the lyrics for her hit "These Boots Are Made For Walking".&lt;ref name="nancy sinatra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicposters.com/Nancy_Sinatra/poster/New_Fillmore_Series/194|title=Nancy Sinatra at the Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA June 28, 1995|publisher=Classicposters.com|accessdate=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another example of pasta art was featured in an episode of the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''. [[Cosmo Kramer]] produced a small sculpture made of [[fusilli]] called "Fusili Jerry".

'''Mezzotint''' is a [[printmaking]] process of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family, technically a [[drypoint]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mezzotint|title=Definition of MEZZOTINT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[Grayscale|tonal method]] to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like [[hatching]], cross-hatching or [[stipple]]. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a "rocker".  In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.

==History==
[[Image:Ludwig von Siegen - Portrait of Amelie Elisabeth von Hessen.jpg|thumb|The first known mezzotint, by [[Ludwig von Siegen]], 1642]]
The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the German amateur artist [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609–{{circa|1680}}). His earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of [[Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-Münzenberg]].  This was made by working from light to dark. The rocker seems to have been invented by [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], a famous cavalry commander in the [[English Civil War]], who was the next to use the process, and took it to England.  Sir [[Peter Lely]] saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits, and encouraged a number of Dutch printmakers to come to England.  [[Godfrey Kneller]] worked closely with [[John Smith (engraver)|John Smith]], who is said to have lived in his house for a period; he created about 500 mezzotints, some 300 copies of portrait paintings.  

The process was especially widely used in England from the eighteenth century, to reproduce portraits and other paintings.  Since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used. [[Robert Kipniss]] and [[Peter Ilsted]] are two notable 20th-century exponents of the technique; [[M. C. Escher]] also made eight mezzotints.

British mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Great Crash]] of 1929, also spreading to America.  The main area of collecting was British portraits; hit oil paintings from the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] were routinely, and profitably, reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period, and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures, or if necessary, made them up.  The favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820, the great period of the British portrait.  There were two basic styles of collection: some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope, while others aimed at perfect condition and quality (which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate), and in collecting the many "[[State (printmaking)|proof states]]" which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on.  Leading collectors included [[William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore]] and the Irishman [[John Chaloner Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 134–137 and 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark to light method==
This became the most common method.  The whole surface (usually) of a [[metal]], usually copper, plate is roughened evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically.  If the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool. A burnisher has a smooth, round end, which flattens the minutely protruding points comprising the roughened surface of the metal printing plate.  Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print "white," that is, without ink.  By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name ''mezzo-tinto'' which is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "[[half-tone]]" or "half-painted".  This is called working from "dark to light", or the "subtractive" method.

==Light to dark method==
[[Image:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg|thumb|left|Early mezzotint by Vaillerant, Siegen's assistant or tutor. Young man reading, with statue of Cupid. Probably made using light to dark technique. 27.5 &amp;times; 21.3 cm]]
Alternatively, it is possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively, where the darker parts of the image are to be.  This is called working from "light to dark", or the "additive" method.  The first mezzotints by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] were made in this way. Especially in this method, the mezzotint can be combined with other intaglio techniques, such as engraving, on areas of the plate not roughened, or even with the dark to light method.

==Printing==
Printing the finished plate is the same for either method, and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate; the whole surface is inked, the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate. The plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper, and the process repeated.

Because the pits in the plate are not deep, only a small number of top-quality impressions (copies) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out.  Perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Detailed technique==
Plates can be mechanically roughened; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the [[copper]]. The plate is then moved – either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference – and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.

==Tone==
Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], ''burnisher'' and ''scraper'' allows fine gradations in tone to be developed. The scraper is a triangular ended tool, and the burnisher has a smooth round end – not unlike many spoon handles.

{{nihongo|'''''Mingei'''''|民芸||"folk arts" or "arts of the people"}}, the [[Japan]]ese [[folk art]] movement, was developed in the late 1920s and 1930s in Japan. Its founding father was [[Yanagi Sōetsu]] (1889–1961).

==Origins==
In 1916, Yanagi made his first trip to [[Korea]] out of a curiosity for Korean crafts. The trip led to the establishment of the Korean Folk Crafts Museum in 1924, and the coining of the term ''mingei'' by Yanagi, potters [[Hamada Shōji]] (1894–1978) and [[Kawai Kanjirō]] (1890–1966). In 1926, the [[Folk Art]] Movement was formally declared by Yanagi Sōetsu. Yanagi rescued lowly pots used by commoners in the [[Edo]] and [[Meiji period]] that were disappearing in rapidly urbanizing Japan. In 1936, the Japanese Folk Crafts Museum was established.

==Theory==
The philosophical pillar of ''mingei'' is "hand-crafted art of ordinary people" ({{nihongo|民衆的な工芸|minshū-teki-na kōgei}}). Yanagi Sōetsu discovered beauty in everyday ordinary and utilitarian objects created by nameless and unknown craftsmen. According to Yanagi, utilitarian objects made by the common people are "beyond beauty and ugliness". Below are a few criteria of ''mingei'' art and crafts:

*made by anonymous crafts people
*produced by hand in quantity
*inexpensive
*used by the masses
*functional in daily life
*representative of the regions in which they were produced.

Yanagi's book ''The Unknown Craftsman'' has become an influential work since its first release in English in 1972. Yanagi's book examines the Japanese way of viewing and appreciating art and beauty in everyday crafts, including [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[lacquer]], [[textiles]], and [[woodwork]].

==Criticisms of Theory and Orientalism==
[[File:Thrown Bowl by Bernard Leach (YORYM-2004.1.166).JPG|thumb|Thrown bowl by [[Bernard Leach]]]]
In recent decades, scholars such as Yuko Kikuchi and Brian Moeran have claimed they have uncovered power relations and [[ultra-nationalism]] that lie at the core of the formation of ''mingei'' theory. In 1927, Yanagi put forward the "criterion of beauty in Japan" ({{lang|ja|日本における美の標準}} ''{{transl|ja|nihon ni okeru bi no hyōjun}}'') in ''The Way of Crafts'' ({{lang|ja|工芸の道}} ''{{transl|ja|kōgei no michi}}''). During the years of rising [[militarism]] in Japan, Sōetsu Yanagi extended his application of the "criterion of beauty" to the crafts of the [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawans]] and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in the Japanese peripheries, and to those of the [[Japanese colonies|colonies]] including [[Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Manchuria]]. These scholars argue that ''mingei'' theory, far from being an [[Oriental]] theory, is a "hybridization" and "appropriation" of [[Europe|Occidental]] ideas such as that of [[William Morris]] (1834–1896)&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/2008/Nakanishi.html Wendy Jones Nakanishi, "The Anxiety of Influence: Ambivalent Relations Between Japan's 'Mingei' and Britain's 'Arts and Crafts' Movements", Electronic Journal of Japanese Studies, 28 October 2008'']&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Bernard Leach]] (1887–1979) introduced when he lived and worked in Japan from 1909 to 1920.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Citation

Yūko Kikuchi terms this phenomenon "Oriental Orientalism".

Yanagi’s ''Korea and its Art'' was severely criticized by Korean intellectuals as a "colonialist view of history" in 1974. Yanagi defined "beauty of sadness" ({{lang|ja|悲哀の美}} ''{{transl|ja|hiai no bi}}'') as the "innate, original beauty created by the Korean race" ({{lang|ja|民族の固有の美}} ''{{transl|ja|minzoku no koyū no bi}}''). Yanagi believed that the long history of foreign invasions of Korea was reflected in Korean art, and especially in its [[pottery]], in the "sad and lonely" lines. Such a theory has been criticized by Korean scholars as the "aesthetic of [[colonialism]]".

In [[visual arts]], [[Minimal music|music]], and other mediums, '''minimalism''' is an [[art movement]] that began in post–[[World War II]] Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with minimalism include [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], and [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10459 |title=Christopher Want, ''Minimalism'', Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minimalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm|title=Minimalism|publisher=theartstory.org|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the reductive aspects of [[modernism]] and is often interpreted as a reaction against [[abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|postminimal]] art practices.

[[Minimalist music|Minimalism in music]] often features repetition and iteration such as those of the compositions of [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Julius Eastman]], and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. The term ''minimalist'' often colloquially refers to anything that is spare or stripped to its essentials. It has accordingly been used to describe the [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[novel]]s of [[Samuel Beckett]], the films of [[Robert Bresson]], the stories of [[Raymond Carver]], and the automobile designs of [[Colin Chapman]]. &lt;!--The word was first used in English in the early 20th century to describe a 1915 composition by the Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], ''[[Black Square (painting)|Black Square]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013.

Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as "minimal art", "literalist art"&lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. "Art and Objecthood", ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "ABC Art"&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. "ABC Art", ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October–November 1965): 57–69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan, as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture'' shown from April 27 – June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 |title=''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art |title=Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the art movement called ''minimal art'' emerged.

In a more broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of Kazimir Malevich, [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ |title=Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'' |publisher=Artcritical.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein had painted [[Monochrome painting|monochromes]] as early as 1949, and held the first private exhibition of this work in 1950—but his first public showing was the publication of the [[Artist's book]] ''[[Yves: Peintures]]'' in November 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Weitemeier, ''Yves Klein, 1928–1962: International Klein Blue'', Original-Ausgabe (Cologne: Taschen, 1994), 15. {{ISBN|3-8228-8950-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Paint Uncovered|chapter=Restoring the Immaterial: Study and Treatment of Yves Klein's ''Blue Monochrome (IKB42)''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false |title=Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161–172 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 [[Artforum]] essay ''Last Exit: Painting,'' minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's&lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |title=Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960 |publisher=Sharecom.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson, minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this interpretation of what he said, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, and unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], a theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1–3", originally published across three issues of ''Artforum'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] – "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''Artforum'', 1969, continuing on to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transition into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.

One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter [[Frank Stella]], four of whose early "black paintings" were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's black paintings were often determined by the dimensions of the lumber he used for stretchers to support the canvas, visible against the canvas as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side. Stella's decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripes]]. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, but other artists—including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Robert Ryman]]—had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism |title=Britannica.com |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oisteanu |first=Valery |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman |title=Brooklynrail.org |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticized by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of Artforum. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing—namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

''The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.''&lt;ref&gt;in Barbara Rose, ed. ''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an interview with Dorothy Strickler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Oral history interview with Lee Krasner, 1964 Nov. 2-1968 Apr. 11 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm |title=Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I brought Hofmann up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann’s reaction was—one of the questions he asked Jackson was, "Do you work from nature?" There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson’s answer was, "I am nature." And Hofmann’s reply was, "Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself." To which Jackson did not reply at all. The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in [[design]] and [[architecture]], wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Minimalist architectural designers focus on the connection between two perfect planes, elegant lighting, and the void spaces left by the removal of three-dimensional shapes in an architectural design.{{according to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 

Minimalistic design has been highly influenced by [[Japanese architecture|Japanese traditional design and architecture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The works of [[De Stijl]] artists are a major reference: De Stijl expanded the ideas of expression by meticulously organizing basic elements such as lines and planes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With regard to home design, more attractive "minimalistic" designs are not truly minimalistic because they are larger, and use more expensive building materials and finishes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

There are observers who describe the emergence of minimalism as a response to the brashness and chaos of urban life. In Japan, for example, minimalist architecture began to gain traction in the 1980s when its cities experienced rapid expansion and booming population. The design was considered an antidote to the "overpowering presence of traffic, advertising, jumbled building scales, and imposing roadways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fractal Dimension of Architecture|last=Ostwald|first=Michael|last2=Vaughan|first2=Josephine|publisher=Birkhauser|year=2016|isbn=9783319324241|location=Newcastle|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaotic environment was not only driven by urbanization, industrialization, and technology but also the Japanese experience of constantly having to demolish structures on account of the destruction wrought by World War II and the earthquakes, including the calamities it entails such as fire. The minimalist design philosophy did not arrive in Japan by way of another country as it was already part of the Japanese culture rooted on the Zen philosophy. There are those who specifically attribute the design movement to Japan's spirituality and view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of Minimalism|last=Cerver|first=Francisco|publisher=Arco|year=1997|isbn=9780823061495|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (1886–1969) adopted the motto "Less is more" to describe his aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philip Johnson]], op. cit.  A similar sentiment was conveyed by industrial designer Dieter Rams' motto, "Less but better."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tactic was one of arranging the necessary components of a building to create an impression of extreme simplicity—he enlisted every element and detail to serve multiple visual and functional purposes; for example, designing a floor to also serve as the radiator, or a massive fireplace to also house the bathroom. Designer [[Buckminster Fuller]] (1895–1983) adopted the engineer's goal of "Doing more with less", but his concerns were oriented toward technology and engineering rather than aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Johnson]], ''Mies van der Rohe'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1947, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Barragán]] is an exemplary modern minimalist designer.{{According to whom|date=August 2016}}{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Other contemporary minimalist architects include [[Kazuyo Sejima]], [[John Pawson]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[Álvaro Siza Vieira]], [[Tadao Ando]], [[Alberto Campo Baeza]], [[Yoshio Taniguchi]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Hugh Newell Jacobsen]], Vincent Van Duysen, [[Claudio Silvestrin]], [[Michael Gabellini]], and [[Gluckman Mayner Architects|Richard Gluckman]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006).

==Minimalist architecture and space==
Minimalist architecture became popular in the late 1980s in London and New York,&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; where architects and fashion designers worked together in the boutiques to achieve simplicity, using white elements, cold lighting, large space with minimum objects and furniture.

===Concepts and design elements===
The concept of minimalist architecture is to strip everything down to its essential quality and achieve simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is not completely without ornamentation,&lt;ref name="Rossell"&gt;Rossell (2005), Minimalist Interiors, New York: HapperCollins. p6.&lt;/ref&gt; but that all parts, details, and joinery are considered as reduced to a stage where no one can remove anything further to improve the design.&lt;ref name="Pawson"&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The considerations for ‘essences’ are light, form, detail of material, space, place, and human condition.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalist architects not only consider the physical qualities of the building. They consider the spiritual dimension and the invisible, by listening to the figure and paying attention to  details, people, space, nature, and materials.,&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; believing this reveals the abstract quality of something that is invisible and aids the search for the essence of those invisible qualities—such as natural light, sky, earth, and air. In addition, they "open a dialogue" with the surrounding environment to decide the most essential materials for the construction and create relationships between buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Rossell"/&gt;

In minimalist architecture, design elements strive to convey the message of simplicity. The basic geometric forms, elements without decoration, simple materials and the repetitions of structures represent a sense of order and essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p8.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of natural light in buildings reveals simple and clean spaces.&lt;ref name="Bertoni15-16"/&gt; In the late 19th century as the arts and crafts movement became popular in Britain, people valued the attitude of ‘truth to materials’ with respect to the profound and innate characteristics of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. P.87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimalist architects humbly 'listen to figure,' seeking essence and simplicity by rediscovering the valuable qualities in simple and common materials.&lt;ref name="Bertoni21"/&gt;

===Influences from Japanese tradition===
{{see also|Japanese architecture}}

[[Image:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|right|Ryōan-ji dry garden.The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects "wabi" and the rock garden "sabi", together reflecting the Japanese worldview or aesthetic of "[[wabi-sabi]]".&lt;ref&gt;森神逍遥 『侘び然び幽玄のこころ』桜の花出版、2015年 Morigami Shouyo, "Wabi sabi yugen no kokoro: seiyo tetsugaku o koeru joi ishiki" (Japanese) {{ISBN|978-4434201424}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]&lt;!-- The size of this image is specified because its default size is a bit too small considering the importance of the garden -- and the details can be more fully appreciated in an enlarged scale. --&gt;

The idea of simplicity appears in many cultures, especially the Japanese traditional culture of Zen Philosophy. Japanese manipulate the Zen culture into aesthetic and design elements for their buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p.85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of architecture has influenced Western Society, especially in America since the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster (September 1953), Japanese Buildings in the United States before 1900: Their Influence upon American Domestic Architecture, The Art Bulletin, vol. 35, no. 3. p217–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it inspired the minimalist architecture in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt;

Zen concepts of simplicity transmit the ideas of freedom and essence of living.&lt;ref name="Pawson"/&gt; Simplicity is not only aesthetic value, it has a moral perception that looks into the nature of truth and reveals the inner qualities and essence of materials and objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p87.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[sand garden]] in [[Ryoanji]] temple demonstrates the concepts of simplicity and the essentiality from the considered setting of a few stones and a huge empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic principle of [[Ma (negative space)|Ma]] refers to empty or open space. It removes all the unnecessary internal walls and opens up the space. The emptiness of spatial arrangement reduces everything down to the most essential quality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese aesthetic of [[Wabi-sabi]] values the quality of simple and plain objects.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1. p85.&lt;/ref&gt; It appreciates the absence of unnecessary features, treasures a life in quietness and aims to reveal the innate character of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Japanese floral art, also known as [[Ikebana]], has the central principle of letting the flower express itself. People cut off the branches, leaves and blossoms from the plants and only retain the essential part of the plant. This conveys the idea of essential quality and innate character in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Saito, (Winter 2007), The Moral Dimension of Japanese Aesthetics, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, vol.65, no. 1.p86.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, far from being just a spatial concept, Ma is ever-present in all aspects of Japanese daily life, as it applies to time as well as to daily tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wawaza.com/pages/when-less-is-more-the-concept-of-japanese-ma.html |title=When Less is More: the Concept of Japanese "MA" |publisher=Wawaza.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist architects and their works===
The Japanese minimalist architect, [[Tadao Ando]] conveys the Japanese traditional spirit and his own perception of nature in his works. His design concepts are materials, pure geometry and nature. He normally uses concrete or natural wood and basic structural form to achieve austerity and rays of light in space. He also sets up dialogue between the site and nature to create relationship and order with the buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Ando’s works and the translation of Japanese aesthetic principles are highly influential on Japanese architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Japanese minimalist architect, [[Kazuyo Sejima]], works on her own and in conjunction with [[Ryue Nishizawa]], as [[SANAA]], producing iconic Japanese Minimalist buildings. Credited with creating and influencing a particular genre of Japanese Minimalism,&lt;ref&gt;Puglisi, L.P. (2008), New Directions in Contermporary Architecture, Chichester, John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Sejimas delicate, intelligent designs may use white color, thin construction sections and transparent elements to create the phenomenal building type often associated with minimalism. Works include [[New Museum]](2010) New York City, Small House (2000) Tokyo, House surrounded By Plum Trees (2003) Tokyo.

In Vitra Conference Pavilion, Weil am Rhein, 1993, the concepts are to bring together the relationships between building, human movement, site and nature. Which as one main point of minimalism ideology that establish dialogue between the building and site. The building uses the simple forms of circle and rectangle to contrast the filled and void space of the interior and nature. In the foyer, there is a large landscape window that looks out to the exterior. This achieves the simple and silence of architecture and enhances the light, wind, time and nature in space.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pawson]] is a British minimalist architect; his design concepts are soul, light, and order. He believes that though reduced clutter and simplification of the interior to a point that gets beyond the idea of essential quality, there is a sense of clarity and richness of simplicity instead of emptiness. The materials in his design reveal the perception toward space, surface, and volume. Moreover, he likes to use natural materials because of their aliveness, sense of depth and quality of an individual. He is also attracted by the important influences from Japanese Zen Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson (1996), Minimum, London: Phaidon Press Limited. p10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin Klein Madison Avenue, New York, 1995–96, is a boutique that conveys Calvin Klein’s ideas of fashion. John Pawson’s interior design concepts for this project are to create simple, peaceful and orderly spatial arrangements. He used stone floors and white walls to achieve simplicity and harmony for space. He also emphasises reduction and eliminates the visual distortions, such as the air conditioning and lamps to achieve a sense of purity for interior.&lt;ref&gt;Cerver 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Campo Baeza]] is a Spanish architect and describes his work as essential architecture. He values the concepts of light, idea and space. Light is essential and achieves the relationship between inhabitants and the building. Ideas are to meet the function and context of space, forms, and construction. Space is shaped by the minimal geometric forms to avoid decoration that is not essential.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gasper House, Zahora, 1992 is a residence that the client wanted to be independent. High walls create the enclosed space and the stone floors used in house and courtyard show the continuality of interior and exterior. The white colour of the walls reveals the simplicity and unity of the building. The feature of the structure make lines to form the continuously horizontal house, therefore natural light projects horizontally through the building.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary minimalism==
Literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words and a focus on surface description. Minimalist writers eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning. Readers are expected to take an active role in creating the story, to "choose sides" based on oblique hints and innuendo, rather than react to directions from the writer.

Some 1940s-era crime fiction of writers such as [[James M. Cain]] and [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] adopted a stripped-down, matter-of-fact prose style to considerable effect; some classify this prose style as minimalism.{{Weasel inline|date=November 2011}}

Another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the [[metafiction]] trend of the 1960s and early 1970s ([[John Barth]], [[Robert Coover]], and [[William H. Gass]]). These writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Minimalist writers, or those who are identified with minimalism during certain periods of their writing careers, include the following: [[Raymond Carver]], [[Ann Beattie]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[K. J. Stevens]], [[Amy Hempel]], [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Mary Robison]], [[Frederick Barthelme]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Patrick Holland (author)|Patrick Holland]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Alicia Erian]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

American poets such as [[Stephen Crane]], [[William Carlos Williams]], early [[Ezra Pound]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]], and [[Aram Saroyan]] are sometimes identified with their ''minimalist'' style. The term "minimalism" is also sometimes associated with the briefest of poetic genres, [[haiku]], which originated in Japan, but has been domesticated in English literature by poets such as [[Nick Virgilio]], [[Raymond Roseliep]], and [[George Swede]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Irish writer [[Samuel Beckett]] is well known for his minimalist plays and prose, as is the Norwegian writer [[Jon Fosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=Samuel Beckett|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5161|website=Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''The Easy Chain'', [[Evan Dara]] includes a 60-page section written in the style of musical minimalism, in particular inspired by composer [[Steve Reich]]. Intending to represent the psychological state (agitation) of the novel's main character, the section's successive lines of text are built on repetitive and developing phrases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Minimal music==
{{main article|Minimal music}}

The term "minimal music" was derived around 1970 by [[Michael Nyman]] from the concept of minimalism, which was earlier applied to the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name=Bernard93&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernard|first=Jonathan W.|title=The Minimalist Aesthetic in the Plastic Arts and in Music|journal=Perspectives of New Music|date=1993|volume=31|issue= 1 (Winter)|page=87|jstor=833043}}, citing Dan Warburton as his authority.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Warburton88&gt;{{cite web|last=Warburton|first=Dan|title=A Working Terminology for Minimal Music|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/archives/minimalism.html|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, it was in a 1968 review in ''The Spectator'' that Nyman first used the term, to describe a ten-minute piano composition by the Danish composer [[Henning Christiansen]], along with several other unnamed pieces played by [[Charlotte Moorman]] and [[Nam June Paik]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nyman 1968, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">'''Molse School''', ''translated as "School of Mol",'' is a common term for some international paint artists or a specific genre of paintings in late 19th and early 20th century.  The paintings typically show picturesque and rustic places, farms, ... of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[municipality]] [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]], which is located in the [[Campine]].  The most famous painters of the  ''Molse School'' were [[Jakob Smits]] and [[Dirk Baksteen]] who lived in Achterbos, a hamlet of Mol.

Based upon the [[Barbizon school]] the municipality Mol organized an international art [[exhibition]] in 1907 and invited painters from all over the world.   Most of these artists had not met before and their only connection was their stay in a local [[hotel]] during the exhibition. These artists were not tied by a fine art society, neither was there a common style. In total 68 artists participated at this event, showing  212 works. This exhibition was also an attempt to show the artists the beauty of Mol, its [[heath]], the white sand flats and how the inhabitants (mostly [[farmer]]s) lived.  This attempt succeeded.

Upon their return home, the artists showed their paintings to their colleagues. This resulted in those colleagues also coming over to Mol making painting [[en plein air]] popular.

Some artists commonly categorized under the  ''Molse School'' are [[Dirk Baksteen]], [[Gerard Baksteen]], [[Charles Claessens]], [[Leon Delderenne]], [[Paul Mathieu]], [[Ernest Midy]], [[Erneste Rinquet]], [[Jakob Smits]], [[Willem Battaille]], [[Emile Van Damme-Sylva]], [[Paula Van Rompa-Zenke]], [[Gaston De Biemme]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">{{distinguish|The Old Wives' Tale (play)}}
An '''old wives' tale''' is a supposed truth which is actually spurious or a superstition. It can be said sometimes to be a type of [[urban legend]], said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered [[superstition]], [[folklore]] or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, such as [[pregnancy]], [[puberty]], [[social relations]], [[health]], [[herbalism]] and [[nutrition]].

== Origins ==
In this context, the word ''wife'' means "woman" rather than "married woman". This usage stems from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|{{wt|ang|wif}}}}'' ("woman") and is akin to the [[German language|German]] ''{{linktext|Weib|lang=de}}'' (also meaning "woman"). This sense of the word is still used in [[Modern English]] in constructions such as ''[[midwife]]'' and ''[[fishwife]]''.

Old wives' tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviors, usually of children, or to share knowledge of [[traditional medicine|folk cures]] for ailments ranging from [[toothaches]] to [[dysentery]].

The concept of old wives' tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the [[King James Bible]] was published with the following translation of the [[Apostle Paul]] writing to his young protégé [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], "But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness" ([[I Timothy]] 4:7 [[KJV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Ti&amp;c=4&amp;v=7&amp;t=KJV#7|title=1 Timothy 4:7 (KJV)|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== The oral tradition ===

Old wives' tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or [[coming of age]] easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don't do certain things.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 15 May 2010, Greer, Germaine. "Grandmother's footsteps" http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/15/germaine-greer-old-wives-tales&lt;/ref&gt;

These tales have often been collected by literate men, and turned into written works. Fairy tales by [[Giambattista Basile|Basile]], [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]], and the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]] have their roots in the oral tradition of women. These male writers took the stories from women, with their plucky, clever heroines and heroes, and turned them into [[morality tale]]s for children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, Jack. ''The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood'', Routledge, 1993 {{ISBN|0-415-90834-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paper craft''' is the collection of [[art]] forms employing [[paper]] or [[card stock|card]] as the primary [[artistic medium]] for the creation of three-dimensional objects.  It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded,  stitched, or layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=6 |title=The Complete Photo Guide to Paper Crafts|first=Patrice |last=Boerens |isbn=978-1-58923-468-0 |publisher=Creative Publishing International |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papermaking]] by hand is also an important paper craft. [[Painting]] and [[calligraphy]] though they are commonly applied as decoration are normally considered as separate arts or crafts.

Paper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caribbean-craft.com/|title=Handmade Home Decor {{!}} Paper Mache {{!}} Caribbean Craft|last=Craft|first=Caribbean|website=www.caribbean-craft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the [[education]] of children.  Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals.&lt;ref name="Therapy"&gt;Carol Tubbs, Margaret Drake, ''Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy'', "Paper crafts", (2006), p. 221-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also neater to work with than paints, dyes, and other coloring materials.  Paper crafts may also be used in [[psychotherapy|therapeutic]] settings, providing children with a safe and uncomplicated creative outlet to express feelings.&lt;ref name="Therapy"/&gt;

==Folded paper==
The word "paper" derives from [[papyrus]], the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in [[Egypt]] as far back as the third millennium B.C.&lt;ref name=Skeat&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat, 1935. "Papyrus and its uses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018121945/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html |date=2013-10-18 }} ([[British Museum]] pamphlet).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the earliest known example of "paper folding" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern [[road]] [[map]].&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers.&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; 

The first Japanese origami is dated from the 6th century A.D.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;Lang, Robert James. [1988] (1988). The Complete Book of Origami: Step-by Step Instructions in Over 1000 Diagrams/48 Original Models. Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-25837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the [[Western world|West]], the term [[origami]] is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Bible"&gt;Nick Robinson, ''The Origami Bible'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi ([[Chinese paper folding]]), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and [[paper plane]]s.

==Cut paper==
{{Main|Papercutting}}
[[Papel picado]], as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while [[Chinese paper cutting]] uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. [[Wycinanki]] and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.

==Paper pulp painting==

Images built using colored paper pulp are a form of paper art that started in the 20th century. [[Chuck Close]], [[Lynn Sures]] are among contemporary artist developing this medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Pastiche.jpg|thumb|A pastiche combining elements of two paintings ([[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 005.jpg|original 1]] and [[:File:Sandro Botticelli 068.jpg|original 2]]), using [[Photoshop]]]]

A '''pastiche''' is a work of [[visual art]], literature, theatre, or music that [[Imitation|imitates]] the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJVlZjIe5o8C&amp;pg=PA1005 |page=1005 |isbn=0-691-15491-0 |editor=Roland Greene |editor2=Stephen Cushman |editor3=Clare Cavanagh |editor4=Jahan Ramazani |editor5=Paul F. Rouzer |editor6=Harris Feinsod |editor7=David Marno |editor8=Alexandra Slessarev |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[parody]], pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoestery |first=Ingeborg |title=Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfpcjdU5fD8C |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-33880-8 |oclc=44812124 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''pastiche'' is a French [[cognate]] of the Italian noun ''[[wikt:pasticcio|pasticcio]]'', which is a [[pâté]] or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pastiche|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, ''pastiche'' and ''[[pasticcio]]'' describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work. Pastiche is an example of [[eclecticism in art]].

[[Allusion]] is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Moreover, allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=1-4130-3390-3 |last1=Abrams |first1=Meyer Howard |last2=Harpham |first2=Geoffrey |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of [[intertextuality]].

{{anchor|Imitation}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Film noir]] --&gt;

===Literature===
{{see also|Dionysian imitatio}}
In literature usage, the term denotes a [[literary technique]] employing a generally light-hearted tongue-in-cheek imitation of another's style; although jocular, it is usually respectful.{{citation needed | date = October 2013}}

For example, many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]], originally penned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], have been written as pastiches since the author's time.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=8047|title= Pastiche Nuts|last= Lopresti|first= Rob|date= 2009-08-12|work= Tune It Or Die!|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=125|title= When Good Characters Go Bad|last= Lundin|first= Leigh|date= 2007-07-15|work= ADD Detective|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellery Queen]] and [[Nero Wolfe]] are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=3561|title= The Pastiche|last= Andrews|first= Dale|date= 2008-10-28|work= Mystery Masterclass|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themysteryplace.com/forum/messages.aspx?TopicID=241|title= Pastiche vs. fan fiction.

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the [[Robert E. Howard]] stories, written by other writers without Howard's authorization. This includes the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]].
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a pastiche of works by [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. In 1991 [[Alexandra Ripley]] wrote the novel ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', a pastiche of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] sequel. 

In 2017, John Banville published Mrs. Osmond, a sequel to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, written in a style similar to that of James.

===Music===

[[Charles Rosen]] has characterized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] various works in imitation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] style as pastiche, and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s works, such as his ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' and [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky) | ''Serenade for Strings'']], employ a poised "classical" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite).&lt;ref name="brown_ng18628"&gt;* Brown, David, "Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich." In ''The New Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (London: MacMillan, 1980), 20 vols., ed. Sadie, Stanley. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. 18:628&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of [[George Rochberg]], who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from [[serialism]] after the death of his son in 1963.

"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all "hodge-podged" together to create one piece of music.&lt;ref name="An Invitation to the Opera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|title= AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA|last= Baker|first= Roy Thomas|date= October 1995|publisher= Sound on Sound|accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar earlier example is "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]]. One can find musical "pastiches" throughout the work of the American composer [[Frank Zappa]].

A ''pastiche Mass'' is a musical [[Mass (music)|Mass]] where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by [[early music | early-music]] ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; for example, the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' by [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===

In musical theatre pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical ''[[Follies]]'', a show about a reunion of performers from a musical [[revue]] set between the World Wars, [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[George Gershwin]] but also the lyrics of writers such as [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Otto Harbach]], and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song "[[Losing My Mind]]" sung in the show contains "near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies" from the Gershwins' [[The Man I Love (song)|"The Man I Love"]] and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies" Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including [[Gypsy (musical) | ''Gypsy'']], [[Saturday Night (musical) | ''Saturday Night'']], and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies", Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Pastiche can also be a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] device whereby filmmakers pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to another filmmaker's style and use of [[cinematography]], including camera angles, [[lighting]], and [[mise en scène]]. A film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and [[documentaries]] but can be found in [[non-fiction]] [[drama]], [[comedy]] and [[Horror film|horror]] films as well). Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]`s [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] is a pastiche of earlier American [[Westerns]]. Another major filmmaker, [[Quentin Tarantino]], often uses various plots, characteristics and themes from many lesser-known films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that "I steal from every single movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/markets-festivals/quentin-tarantino-the-great-recycler-1200703098/|title=Quentin Tarantino: The Great Recycler|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=7 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Todd Haynes]]' 2002 film [[Far From Heaven]] was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical [[Douglas Sirk]] melodrama - in particular [[All That Heaven Allows]]. The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama.

In cinema, the influence of [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film ''[[Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn]]'') can be regarded as a function of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="Jameson, 1991"&gt;(Jameson, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sandoval, Chela. Methodology of the Oppressed. Minneapolis,MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
In discussions of [[urban planning]], the term "pastiche" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major [[architects]]: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many post-war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as [[Le Corbusier]] or [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The term itself is not pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;Jamses Stevens Curl, "Oxford Dictionary of Architecture", 2006, p562.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Alain de Botton]] describes pastiche as "an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Channel 4]]|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-perfect-home/episode-guide|title= Alain de Botton: The Perfect Home}}

:The intended multiple use of performing arts centers in this sense differentiates them from single-purpose [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], [[opera house]]s or [[theater (structure)|theatres]], although the actual use of single-purpose spaces for other than their intended use is widespread. This sort of space has a long history extending to the Roman [[Colosseum]] and Greek amphitheatres.

* A cluster of performance spaces, either separate buildings or under one roof, each space designed for a specific purpose such as [[orchestra|symphonic music]] or [[chamber music]] or theatre, but multi-purpose as a whole. The modern version of this came into being only in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=PAC&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Steven A.|title=The evolution of the performing arts center|url=http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|publisher=AMS Planning &amp; Research Corp|accessdate=20 January 2014|date=October 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114201139/http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|archivedate=14 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:Examples of this type of PAC are the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C., the [[Sydney Opera House]], and the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] in New York City.

Some performing arts center organizations act as sole presenter for events using the venues within the center, but most also frequently rent their performance spaces to other [[performing arts presenters]] or self-presenting performing arts groups. Examples of this practice is the [[Celebrity Series of Boston]] renting venues in Boston's [[Boch Center]].

New performing arts centers emerged in the latter part of the 20th century as a means of generating new investment and increased economic activity and thus, a means for revitalizing neighborhoods as patrons are drawn to local restaurants and other businesses. PACs became a draw for touring shows and eventually included visual art in their facilities. Today, these centers are valuable civic resources that provide education, access, exchange of creative discourse, opportunities for cultural expression and awareness.&lt;ref name=PAC/&gt;

==History==
The Prešeren Award was for the first time bestowed in 1947, on the basis of a decree from 1946. It was originally given on 8 February, [[Prešeren Day]], the holiday commemorating the anniversary of the death of the Slovene [[national poet]] [[France Prešeren]].&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; In 1955, the first act on the Prešeren awards was passed. By it, the award gained its current name and the Prešeren Fund was established, which by the amendments of the act in 1956 became a legal personality.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since 1961, the awards were conferred also for the lifetime work. In addition, the Prešeren Fund Award was introduced.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since that year, these awards have been conferred only for exceptional achievements in the field of arts. In 1982, the Prešeren Fund came under the auspice of the [[Cultural Community of Slovenia]]. At most three Prešeren Awards and ten Prešeren Fund Awards were given.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since 1991, when the ''Prešeren Award Act'' ({{lang|sl|Zakon o Prešernovi nagradi}}) was passed,&lt;ref name="ZUODNO-G"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pisrs.si/Predpis.aspx?id=ZAKO866&amp;pogled=osnovni |title=Zakon o Prešernovi nagradi (ZPreN) Ur.l. RS, št. 29I/1991) |accessdate=19 April 2011 |work=PisRS |publisher=Office of Legislation, Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fund works under the auspice of the Slovenian administrative body in charge of culture.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; According to the act, at most two awards may be given.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Prešeren Fund==
The Prešeren Award and the Prešeren Fund Award are bestowed by the Prešeren Fund Management Board ({{lang|sl|Upravni odbor Prešernovega sklada}}). Its 15 members are artists or other cultural workers, like critics, historians, and theoreticians. They are nominated by the [[Slovenian Government]] and elected for a four-year term by the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly of Slovenia]]. The board, which was last elected in May 2008, elected [[Jaroslav Skrušny]] as its chair in July 2008.&lt;ref name="STA2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ms.sta.si/2011/09/prva-seja-upravnega-odbora-presernovega-sklada-v-kranju/ |title=Prva seja upravnega odbora Prešernovega sklada v Kranju |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The First Session of the Prešeren Fund Management Board in Kranj |date=22 September 2011 |newspaper=Misli slovensko [Think Slovene] |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418153027/http://ms.sta.si/2011/09/prva-seja-upravnega-odbora-presernovega-sklada-v-kranju/ |archivedate=18 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prešeren Fund now operates under the auspice of the [[Ministry of Culture (Slovenia)|Slovenian Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name="Fund2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mk.gov.si/en/about_the_ministry/expert_committees_counsels_and_funds/preseren_fund/ |title=Prešeren Fund |publisher=Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131925/http://www.mk.gov.si/en/about_the_ministry/expert_committees_counsels_and_funds/preseren_fund/ |archivedate=17 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in February 2012, Skrušny described the work by the Board as independent and denied any political pressure in the past few years.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Selection and proclamation of the winners==
On 10 February, the Prešeren Fund announces a public tender, which lasts until 15 September. Any physical or legal person may nominate authors for the award, but have to provide appropriate rationale and references.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt; About 100 proposals are put forward each year,&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt; the majority of proposals from the [[performing arts]].&lt;ref name="STA2011" /&gt;  The selection is based on artistic value of the works by the proposed artists as well as other criteria, such as the equal representation of gender, regions, generations, and world views, trying to achieve a balanced and plural choice. Both the established artists and debitants have won the award. The nominees are then selected by the four field committees of the Prešeren Fund, each comprising seven members named by the Prešeren Fund Management Board. Each committee proposes two names for the Prešeren Award and six names for the Prešeren Fund Award, altogether eight for the great award and 24 for the little award. The board then makes the final selection with a secret vote in November after a long discussion and proclaims the awardees after they are elected by two thirds of members. If necessary, more voting rounds may take place. Although in the past, the names of the awardees were announced already on 3 December, the date of the anniversary of Prešeren's births, in the last years they have remained secret until the award ceremony.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Review of the awardees==
Since Slovenian declaration of independence in 1991, the majority of the Prešeren Award winners have been literary artists, among them the only woman being Makarovič, who declined the award in 2000 but accepted the money.&lt;ref name="Planet2011-06"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siol.net/novice/poglobljeno/2011/06/dvajset_let_umetnosti_v_sloveniji.aspx |title=Dvajset let umetnosti v Sloveniji |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Twenty Years of Art in Slovenia |newspaper=Planet Siol.net |publisher=TSMedia d. o. o. |date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the field of performing arts, only two artists won the award. From the field of music, the awardees have been mainly composers and conductors, with the only instrumentalist being the flautist [[Irena Grafenauer]]. A general trend of older men active in [[institution]]alised arts is recognisable among the awardees. The group of the Prešeren Fund Award winners is more diverse.&lt;ref name="Planet2011-06" /&gt;

'''Princess and dragon''' is a generic premise common to many [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and [[chivalric romance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' p 83 {{ISBN|0-226-35992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Northrop Frye]] identified it as a central form of the [[quest]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]].

The story involves an upper class woman, generally a princess or similar high-ranking nobility, saved from a [[dragon]], either a literal dragon or a similar danger, by the virtuous hero (see [[Damsel in distress]]). She may be the first woman endangered by the peril, or may be the end of a long succession of women who were not of as high birth as she is, nor as fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 189, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the princess ends up married to the dragon-slayer.

The motifs of the hero who finds the princess about to be sacrificed to the dragon and saves her, the [[false hero]] who takes his place, and the final revelation of the true hero, are the identifying marks of the [[Aarne–Thompson]] folktale type 300, the Dragon-Slayer. They also appear in type 303, the Two Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 24-5, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  These two tales have been found, in different variants, in countries all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 27, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The "princess and dragon" scenario is given even more weight in popular imagination than it is in the original tales; the stereotypical hero is envisioned as slaying dragons even though, for instance, the [[Brothers Grimm]] had only a few tales of dragon and giant slayers among hundreds of tales.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 282, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest example of the motif comes from the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] tale of [[Perseus]], who rescued the princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], a sea monster often described as resembling a serpent or dragon. This was taken up into other [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], such as [[Heracles]], who rescued the princess [[Hesione]] of [[Troy]] from a similar sea monster.  Most ancient versions depicted the dragon as the expression of a god's wrath: in Andromeda's case, because her mother [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]] had compared her beauty to that of the sea [[nymph]]s, and in Hesione's, because her father had reneged on a bargain with [[Poseidon]]. This is less common in fairy tales and other, later versions, where the dragon is frequently acting out of malice.
[[Image:Yoshitoshi Nihon-ryakushi Susanoo-no-mikoto.jpg|thumb|right|''Susanoo'' slaying the ''Yamata no Orochi'', by [[Yoshitoshi]]]]

The Japanese legend of [[Yamata no Orochi]] also invokes this motif. The god Susanoo encounters two "Earthly Deities" who have been forced to sacrifice their seven daughters to the many-headed monster.  Susanoo is able to kill the dragon after getting it drunk on [[sake]] (rice wine).

Another variation is from the tale of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. The tale begins with a dragon making its nest at the [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] which provides a [[city-state]] with water. Consequently, the citizens had to temporarily remove the dragon from its nest in order to collect water. To do so, they offered the dragon a daily [[human sacrifice]]. The victim of the day was chosen by drawing lots. Eventually in this [[lottery]], the lot happened to fall to the local princess. The local [[monarch]] is occasionally depicted begging for her life with no result. She is offered to the dragon but at this point a traveling [[Saint George]] arrives. He faces and defeats the dragon and saves the princess; some versions claim that the dragon is not killed in the fight, but pacified once George ties the princess' sash around its neck. The grateful citizens then abandon their ancestral [[paganism]] and convert to [[Christianity]].

When the tale is not about a dragon but a [[troll]], [[Giant (mythology)|giant]], or [[ogre]], the princess is often a captive rather than about to be eaten, as in ''[[The Three Princesses of Whiteland]]''. These princesses are often a vital source of information to their rescuers, telling them how to perform tasks that the captor sets to them, or how to kill the monster, and when she does not know, as in ''[[The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body]]'', she frequently can pry the information from the giant. Despite the hero's helplessness without this information, the princess is incapable of using the knowledge herself.  

[[Image:Orlando Furioso 20.jpg|thumb|right|Ruggiero Rescuing Angelica, an illustration for ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' by [[Gustave Doré]]]]
Again, if a [[False hero|false claimant]] intimidates her into silence about who actually killed the monster as in the [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Two Brothers]]'', when the hero appears, she will endorse his story, but she will not tell the truth prior to them; she often agrees to marry the false claimant in the hero's absence.  The hero has often cut out the tongue of the dragon, so when the false hero cuts off its head, his claim to have killed it is refuted by its lack of a tongue; the hero produces the tongue and so proves his claim to marry the princess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Lüthi]], ''Once Upon A Time: On the Nature of Fairy Tales'', p 54, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., New York, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  In some tales, however, the princess herself takes steps to ensure that she can identify the hero&amp;mdash;cutting off a piece of his cloak as in ''[[Georgic and Merlin]]'', giving him tokens as in ''[[The Sea-Maiden]]''&amp;mdash;and so separate him from the false hero.

This dragon-slaying hero appears in [[Romance (heroic literature)|medieval romances]] about [[knight-errant|knights-errant]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]'' p 84 {{ISBN|0-226-35992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Russian ''[[Dobrynya Nikitich]]''. In some variants of [[Tristan and Iseult]], [[Tristan]] wins [[Iseult]] for his uncle, King [[Mark of Cornwall]], by killing a dragon that was devastating her father's kingdom; he has to prove his claim when the king's steward claims to be the dragon-slayer.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Wilson, ''Traditional Romance and Tale'', p 46, D.S. Brewer, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Ipswitch, 1976, {{ISBN|0-87471-905-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ludovico Ariosto]] took the concept up into ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' using it not once but twice: the rescue of [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] by Ruggiero, and [[Orlando (character)|Orlando]] rescuing Olimpia. The monster that menaced Olimpia reconnected to the Greek myths; although Ariosto described it as a legend to the characters, the story was that the monster sprung from an offense against [[Proteus]]. In neither case did he marry the rescued woman to the rescuer. [[Edmund Spenser]] depicts St. George in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', but while Una is a princess who seeks aid against a dragon, and her depiction in the opening with a lamb fits the iconography of St. George pagents, the dragon imperils her parents' kingdom, and not her alone. Many tales of dragons, ending with the dragon-slayer marrying a princess, do not precisely fit this cliché because the princess is in no more danger than the rest of the threatened kingdom.

An unusual variant occurs in [[Child ballad]] 34, ''[[Kemp Owyne]]'', where the dragon ''is'' the maiden; the hero, based on [[Ywain]] from Arthurian legend, rescues her from the [[Shapeshifting|transformation]] with three kisses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis James Child]], ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 306, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern versions==
[[Image:За единую Россію.jpg|right|thumb|Russian civil war [[propaganda]] poster: &lt;br&gt; [[White movement|White Russian]] knight is fighting the &lt;br&gt;[[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Red Russian]] dragon]]

In ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', [[Walt Disney]] concluded the tale by having the [[wicked fairy godmother]] [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]] transform herself into a dragon to withstand the prince, converting the fairy tale to one with the princess and dragon theme.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Sleeping Beauty" p 874 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'', both the book and film versions feature a tank in the shape of a dragon that protects Dr. No's island from superstitious intruders.  [[James Bond]] and [[Honey Rider|Honeychile Rider]] are menaced by the dragon, do battle with it, have their friend Quarrel killed and are captured by the crew of the Dragon tank.  Ann Boyd's 1967 book ''The Devil with James Bond'' explores the theory of the updating of the Princess and dragon genre.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

In modern [[fantasy]] works, the dragon may hold the princess captive instead of eating her. [[Patricia Wrede]] spoofed this concept in ''[[Dealing with Dragons]]''.

A subversion of the concept for young readers is [[Robert Munsch]]'s ''[[The Paper Bag Princess]]'', in which a princess outwits a dragon to save a prince (her betrothed, whom she proceeds ''not'' to marry upon him insulting her makeshift clothing instead of thanking her).

In Jay Williams's tale ''The Practical Princess'', a dragon demands that a king should sacrifice his daughter to him so that he will leave the rest of the kingdom alone. But the princess saves herself by making a "princess dummy" out of straw, and filling it with boiling pitch and tar. The princess dresses the dummy in one of her own gowns, then goes to the dragon's cave where she offers herself as a sacrifice. The unwitting dragon swallows the straw dummy whole, and the pitch and tar explodes inside the dragon's stomach, killing him. Afterwards, the princess observes, "Dragons are not very smart."

In the [[Isaac Asimov]] short story ''[[Prince Delightful and the Flameless Dragon]]'', it is revealed that Dragons used to be slain as part of a passage from princehood to adulthood, though after a while, they became a protected species. Contrary to popular myth, they don't eat princesses as they tend to smell of cheap perfume and give indigestion.

==Diversions==

In some stories, mostly in more recent literary works, the cliche involving princesses and dragons is somehow twisted to create a more exciting or humorous effect. For example, in ''[[The Paper Bag Princess]]'', the princess came to realize that her prince was even more obnoxious than the dragon, and refused to go with him, preferring to skip off into the setting sun alone instead. In some versions, the princess may also befriend, tame, personally defeat, or even be turned into a dragon herself. Indeed, there are a few examples when a curse or spell transforms a princess into a dragon or similar creature (e.g. an alligator, giant bird, or fictional reptile species). In such stories, the transformed princess usually aids her sweetheart in a battle against a force of evil. In ''[[The Swan Princess]]'', for example, Princess Odette is transformed into a [[swan]], and she helps her lover triumph in a battle against the sorcerer Rothbart, who has the power to transform himself into a hideous beast (a manifestation of a [[lion]], [[wolf]], and [[bear]]).

'''Proto-Cubism''' (also referred to as '''Protocubism''', '''Pre-Cubism''' or '''Early Cubism''') is an intermediary transition phase in the [[history of art]] chronologically extending from 1906 to 1910. Evidence suggests that the production of proto-Cubist paintings resulted from a wide-ranging series of experiments, circumstances, influences and conditions, rather than from one isolated static event, trajectory, artist or discourse. With its roots stemming from at least the late 19th century this period can be characterized by a move towards the radical geometrization of form and a reduction or limitation of the color palette (in comparison with [[Fauvism]]). It is essentially the first experimental and exploratory phase of an [[art movement]] that would become altogether more extreme, known from the spring of 1911 as [[Cubism]].

Proto-Cubist artworks typically depict objects in geometric schemas of cubic or conic shapes. The illusion of classical [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] is progressively stripped away from objective representation to reveal the constructive essence of the physical world (not just as seen). The term is applied not only to works of this period by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], but to a range of art produced in France during the early 1900s, by such artists as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], and to variants developed elsewhere in Europe. Proto-Cubist works embrace many disparate styles, and would affect diverse individuals, groups and movements, ultimately forming a fundamental stage in the history of [[modern art]] of the [[20th-century art|20th-century]].&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and influences==
The building blocks that lead to the construction of proto-Cubist works are diverse in nature. Neither homogeneous nor isotropic, the progression of each individual artist was unique. The influences that characterize this transition period range from [[Post-Impressionism]], to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Les Nabis]] and [[Neo-Impressionism]], the works of [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Egypt]]ian, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Micronesia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]].

In anticipation of Proto-Cubism the idea of form inherent in art since the [[Renaissance]] had been questioned. The [[Romanticism|romanticist]] [[Eugène Delacroix]], the [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[Gustave Courbet]], and practically all the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] had abandoned a significant portion of [[Classicism]] in favor of ''immediate sensation''. The ''dynamic'' expression favored by these artists presented a challenge in contrast to the ''static'' means of expression promoted by the Academia. The representation of fixed objects occupying a space, was replaced by dynamic colors and form in constant evolution. Yet other means would be necessary to jettison completely the long-standing foundation that surrounded them. While the freedom of Impressionism had certainly jeopardized its integrity, it would take another generation of artists, not just to bring the edifice down piece by piece, but to rebuild an entirely new configuration, ''cube by cube''.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cézanne===
[[File:Paul Cézanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], 1888, ''Mardi gras (Pierot and Harlequin)'', oil on canvas, {{convert|102|x|81|cm|in|abbr=on}}, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]
Several predominant factors mobilized the shift from a more representational art form to one that would become increasingly abstract; one of the most important would be found directly within the works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and exemplified in a widely discussed letter addressed to [[Émile Bernard]] dated 15 April 1904. Cézanne ambiguously writes: "Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point."&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, April 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his preoccupation for the simplification of geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with the means of rendering the effect of volume and space. His rather classical color-modulating system consisted of changing colors from warm to cool as the object turns away from the source of light. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the treatment and of application of the paint itself; a process in which his brushstrokes played an important role. The complexity of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a strong patchwork effect. Increasingly in his later works, as Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, the patchwork becomes larger, bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly abstract. As the color planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora" /&gt;

The art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] acknowledged the importance of Cézanne to the Cubists in his article titled ''From Cézanne to Cubism'' (published in ''Eclair'', 1920). For Vauxcelles the influence had a two-fold character, both 'architectural' and 'intellectual'. He stressed the statement made by [[Émile Bernard]] that Cézanne's optics were "not in the eye, but in his brain".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-28'', Yale University Press, New Have and London, 1987, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Cézanne 112.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Paul Cézanne]], ca.1897, ''Mont Sainte-Victoire seen from the Bibémus Quarry'', oil on canvas, 65 x 81 cm, [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. In order to express the mountain’s grandeur, Cézanne manipulated the scene by painting the mountain twice as large as it would have appeared, and tipped forward so that it would rise up rather than slope backwards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artbma.org/learning%2Dfrom%2Dcezanne/downloads/cezanne%2Dmt%5Fsaint%5Fvictoire.pdf Baltimore Museum of Art, Mont Sainte-Victoire Seen from the Bibémus Quarry, c. 1897, by Paul Cézanne]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With both his courage and experience to draw from, Cézanne created a hybrid art-form. He combined on the one hand the imitative and the ''immobile'', a system left over from the Renaissance, and the ''mobile'' on the other; together to forming a hybrid. His own generation would see in his contradictory codes nothing more than impotence, unaware of his intentions. However, the next generation would see in Cézanne greatness, precisely because of this duality. Cézanne was seen simultaneously as a classicist by those who chose to see in his work the imitation of nature and perspective, and as a revolutionary by those who saw in him a revolt against imitation and classical perspective. Timid, yet clearly manifest, was the will to deconstruct. Artists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice these tendencies inherent in the work of Cézanne, and decided to venture still further.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Avant-garde artists in Paris (including [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[André Lhote]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]]) had begun reevaluating their own work in relation to that of Cézanne. A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings had been held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904. Current works were exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. The influence generated by the work of Cézanne suggests a means by which some of these artist made the transition from [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]] and [[Fauvism]] to [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne syntax didn't just ripple outwards over the sphere, touching those that would become [[Cubism|Cubists]] in France, [[Futurism|Futurists]] in Italy and [[Die Brücke]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[Expressionism|Expressionists]] in Germany, it also created currents that flowed throughout Parisian art world threatening to destabilize (if not topple) at least three of the core foundations of the academia: the geometrical method of perspective used to create the illusion of form, space and depth since the Renaissance; [[Figurative art|Figuratism]], derived from real object sources (and therefore [[Representation (arts)|representational]]), and [[aesthetics]]. At the time, it was assumed that all art aims at beauty, and anything that wasn't beautiful couldn't be counted as art. The proto-Cubists revolted against the concept that objective beauty was central to the definition of art.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Coleman Danto, ''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, ''Deleuze, [[Guattari]] and the Philosophy of Expression'', CRCL, 24:3, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
In his ''Sources of Cubism and Futurism'', art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] reviews the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] roots of modern art, exploring the literary source of both [[Cubism|Cubist]] painting in France and [[Futurism]] in Italy.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/776441?uid=3737952&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101725009653 Daniel Robbins, ''Sources of Cubism and Futurism'', Art Journal, Vol. 41, No. 4, (Winter 1981): pp. 324-27], Published by College Art Association&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution of ''free verse'' with which [[Gustave Kahn]] was associated, was a principle example of the correspondence between progress in art and politics; a growing conviction among young artists. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] acknowledged his indebtedness to it, as a source of modern artistic liberty. "[[Paul Fort]]'s Parisian review ''Vers et Prose''", writes Robbins, "as well as the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], cradle of both [[Jules Romain (author)|Jules Romain]]'s [[Unanimism]] and [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]]'s ''Dramatisme'', had emphasized the importance of this new formal device".&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt; Kahn's free verse was revolutionary because, in his own words, "free verse is mobile, like mobile perspective". In classical French poetry, writes Robbins, "meaning and rhythm were united, and sense and rhythm stopped simultaneously. The unity consisted in the number and rhythm of vowels and consonants together forming an organic and independent cell". The system began to break down, according to Kahn, with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets when they permitted a stop for the ear, with ''no'' stop in meaning. This is akin to [[Jacques Villon]]'s drawings and prints of 1908 and 1909, notes Robbins, "where the hatching lines that create a shape do not stop at the contour, but continue beyond, taking on an independent life".&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

The next step, wrote Kahn, was to impart unity and cohesion by means of a union of related consonants, or the repetition of similar vowel sounds (assonance). Poets were thus free to create novel and complex rhythms, with, if so desired, inversions that destroyed the beat of the [[strophe]]. As Kahn noted, this was shocking because traditionally it was the regularity of the strophe that gave the reader meaning. Symbolist concepts vacated the [[metronome]]-like symmetry and introduced ''liberty'', ''flexibility'' and ''elasticity''. Each was to find her own rhythmic force. The classicists feared that the dismantling of meter by the decadent Symbolist 'barbarians' would undermine the French language, and thus attack the very foundations of social order.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

''Elasticity'', one of Kahn's favorite words used to describe free verse, would become the title of well known Futurist works by [[Umberto Boccioni]], as well as two paintings by [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], a proto-Cubist work and later a cubist work entitled ''Marie Ressort'' (''ressort'' meaning elasticity or spring). These paintings, writes Robbins, are an homage to the prose of [[Jules Laforgue]], whose poems concerned the life of his sister Marie.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1981" /&gt;

====Pablo Picasso====
{{double image|right|El Greco, c.1609-14, The Vision of Saint John, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|190|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|210|[[El Greco]], ''[[The Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'' (c.1609–14, oil, 224.8 × 199.4&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) has been suggested to be the prime source of inspiration for Picasso's {{lang|fr|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon}}.|Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907, oil on canvas, 243.9&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;233.7&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]]) appears to have certain morphological and stylistic similarities with ''The Opening of the Fifth Seal''.||}}
In 1899 Picasso rejected academic study and joined a circle of avant-garde artists and writers known as ''[[Modernisme|modernistes]]'' or ''decadentes''. Meeting at [[Els Quatre Gats]] in [[Barcelona]], they assimilated trends such as symbolism and [[Art nouveau]], characterized by contour lines, simplified form and unnatural colors. Yet, in addition to the influence of [[Théophile Steinlen]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], that of [[Francisco Goya]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/especial/iego.htm Goya and Modernism, Bienal Internacional de São Paulo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117072537/http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/especial/iego.htm |date=2008-01-17 }} Retrieved 27 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[El Greco]] can be seen in Picasso's work of the period. A significant innovation of El Greco's later works is the interweaving of form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two that unifies the painted surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].&lt;ref name="Lambraki57-59"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco'', 57–59&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting these style, the artist produced numerous portraits of friends such as [[Carlos Casagemas]] and [[Jaime Sabartes|Jaime Sabartès]] (Sabartès Seated). The modernists also devoted themselves to political anarchy and other social causes, including sympathy for the poor, denizens and the underclass; subjects that would soon emerge in the paintings of [[Picasso's Blue Period]] (a color associated with despair and melancholy, blue was commonly used in Symbolist painting).&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/picasso.pdf ''Picasso: The Early Years, 1892-1906'', National Gallery of Art (NGA), Washington DC, Exhibition catalogue, March 30 - July 27, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:El Greco - View of Toledo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[El Greco]], c. 1595-1600, ''[[View of Toledo]]'', oil on canvas, 47.75 x 42.75 cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. This work has a striking resemblance to 20th-century [[Expressionism]]. Historically however it is an example of [[Mannerism]].]]
The first artist who seems to have noticed the structural code built into the morphology of late El Greco was [[Paul Cézanne]], one of the forerunners of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Plaka49"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco—The Greek'', 49&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters works reveal common elements: the distortion of the human body, the reddish and unworked backgrounds, and the similarities in the rendering of space.&lt;ref name="Foundoulaki105-106"&gt;E. Foundoulaki, ''From El Greco to Cézanne'', 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, "Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them".&lt;ref name="Brown28"&gt;J. Brown, ''El Greco of Toledo'', 28&lt;/ref&gt; Fry observed that Cézanne drew from "his great discovery of the permeation of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme".&lt;ref name="Lambraki15"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''From El Greco to Cézanne'', 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Picasso moved to Paris, where the work of post-impressionist painters Van Gogh, Cézanne, Seurat, Gauguin were exhibited at galleries and Salons. Rapidly assimilating these influences, he adapted to new styles and techniques, as the use of bright unmixed colors.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

The [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] during his [[Blue Period]], drew on the cool tonality of El Greco and the anatomy of his ascetic figures. While Picasso was working on {{lang|fr|[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]}}, he visited his friend [[Ignacio Zuloaga]] in his Parisian atelier and studied El Greco's ''[[Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'' (owned by Zuloaga since 1897).&lt;ref&gt;Carter .B. Horsley, [http://www.thecityreview.com/elgreco.html ''The Shock of the Old''], El Greco at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art. Accessed 25 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between {{lang|fr|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon}} and the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the stylistic similarities and the relationship between the motifs of both works were analysed. Art historian Ron Johnson was the first to focus on the relationship between the two paintings. According to [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]], ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' "turns out to have a few more answers to give once we realize that the painting owes at least as much to El Greco as [[Cézanne]]".&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;J. Richardson, ''Picasso's Apocalyptic Whorehouse'', 40-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;R. Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon'', 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Picasso's Rose Period]] turns toward the theme of the fairground and circus performers; subjects often depicted in [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]], [[Romanticism|romantic]] and symbolist art and verse (from Baudelaire and Rimbaud to Daumier and Seurat), where melancholy and social alienation pervade the saltimbanque. Corresponding to the tone of Picasso, acrobats represent both mystery and enchantment in the poems of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] written in the same period.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

In 1906, working at the Bateau Lavoir, Picasso continued to explore new directions; portraying monumental female figures standing in abstract interior spaces. Now, in addition to the bathers of Cézanne, Spanish romanesque art and Iberian sculpture provide a prominent influences for Picasso. Around this time he also created a self-portrait depicting himself as something of a latter-day Cézanne.&lt;ref name="NGA, Picasso" /&gt;

====Albert Gleizes====
[[File:L'Abbaye de Créteil.jpg|thumb|upright=1.40|[[Abbaye de Créteil]], ca.1908. First row: Charles Vildrac, René Arcos, Albert Gleizes, Barzun, Alexandre Mercereau. Second row: Georges Duhamel, Berthold Mahn, d'Otémar]]
The proto-Cubism of [[Albert Gleizes]] too bares its roots in Symbolism. In his father's Montmartre workshop (around 1899), Gleizes joins a childhood friend, the poet [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Amiens (1904) he meets the painters [[:fr:Berthold Mahn|Berthold Mahn]], Jacques d'Otémar and Josué Gaboriaud, as well as the printer, Lucien Linard, who will soon run the printshop at the [[Abbaye de Créteil]]. At the same time, through Jean Valmy Baysse, an art critic (and soon historian of the [[Comédie-Française]]) who was a friend of the Gleizes family, René Arcos is invited to participate on a new journal, ''La Vie'', in collaboration with [[Alexandre Mercereau]], [[Charles Vildrac]] and [[Georges Duhamel]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In 1905 the group of writers and painters is joined by the Symbolist poet and writer [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]]. Gleizes is instrumental in forming the Association [[Ernest Renan]], launched in December at the [[Théâtre Pigalle]], with the aim of countering the influence of militarist propaganda while providing the elements of a popular and secular culture. Gleizes is responsible for the ''Literary'' and ''Artistic'' section which organises street theatre and poetry readings.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Throughout 1906, Gleizes and his associates pursue an idea proposed by Charles Vildrac of establishing of a self-supporting artists community which would enable them to develop their art free of commercial considerations. A suitable house and grounds is found in Créteil, then a small village outside Paris. The rent for the first six months is provided by Barzun through a small inheritance. In December, Gleizes and Vildrac move in.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; At the outset of 1907 the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] consists of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel. Duhamel himself, like Barzun, appears intermittently. The group is joined by the musician [[:fr:Albert Doyen|Albert Doyen]], later to become known as founder of the ''Fêtes du Peuple''. [[Alexandre Mercereau]] arrives in the Spring of 1907 with a Russian wife who speaks no French. The group supports itself through the fine quality printing run by Linard and Gleizes. Occasional visitors include the painters Berthold Mahn, Jacques d'Otémar and Henri Doucet.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1909, Bords de la Marne, oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon..jpg|thumb|250px|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1909, ''[[Bords de la Marne (Gleizes)|Les Bords de la Marne (The Banks of the Marne)]]'', oil on canvas, 54 x 65 cm, [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]]]]
The poets of the Abbaye, Arcos, Duhamel and Barzun, develop a distinctive style dealing in ''free verse'', with epic subjects influenced by [[Walt Whitman]], [[Emil Verhaeren]] and, especially, the French epic Symbolist poet [[:fr:René Ghil|René Ghil]]. Ghil developed his ideas on language, at first, in close relation with Symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. Ghil held open evenings every Friday, attended by the members of the Abbaye.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The Abbaye published books by a wide variety of authors including [[:fr:Robert de Montesqiou|Robert de Montesqiou]], model for the Duc de Charlus in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''A la recherche de temps perdu'', the Polish anarchist and art theorist [[:fr:Mecislas Goldberg|Mecislas Goldberg]], and the well-known collection of poems ''La Vie Unanime'', by [[Jules Romains]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; ''La Vie Unanime'' was the result of a vision Romains had in 1903, writes Peter Brooke, "in which he had seen all the phenomena of daily life as intimately related like the different parts of a single huge beast". On the strength of its association with Romains the Abbaye de Créteil is often described as 'Unanimist'.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;
 
During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organise a great ''Journée portes ouvertes'' at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, soon to be the theorist of [[Futurism]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. Gleizes' own painting in this period shifts from Post-Impressionism towards a fluid, linear style, with close relations to Symbolism and [[Les Nabis]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

When the Abbaye closed in January 1908, Gleizes moved into a studio situated in [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], rue du Delta, with his friend the painter and poet [[:fr:Henri Doucet|Henri Doucet]]. Though his subject matter is always taken from an unsentimental observation of the world, writes Brooke, 'Gleizes has a marked preference for urban and semi-urban scenes with an emphasis on human labour'. Though he often uses bright colors there is little or no interest in either Fauvism or Divisionism, the two schools that now dominate the Parisian [[Avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In 1909 Gleizes' evolution towards a more linear proto-Cubist style continues with greater emphasis on clear, simplified, construction; ''[[Bords de la Marne (Gleizes)|Les Bords de la Marne (The Banks of the Marne)]]''. At the [[Salon d'Automne]] Gleizes is impressed by the work of [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], especially his portrait of the poet [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Pierre Jean Jouve]]. Le Fauconnier's portraits and his landscapes painted in Brittany (''[[:fr:Ploumanac'h|Ploumanac'h]]'') show the intention of simplifying form similar to that of Gleizes. The two painters meet through the intermediary of Alexandre Mercereau.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

Gleizes exhibits his proto-Cubist works ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'' at the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified form clearly overwhelms the representational aspect of the works. The same tendency is evident in [[Jean Metzinger]]'s ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (1909) exhibited at the same Salon. In his ''Anecdotiques'', 16 October 1911, Apollinaire writes: "I am honoured to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Indépendants."&lt;ref name="Anecdotiques"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1132933/f46.image Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Anecdotiques'', Jean Metzinger, ''Portrait of Apollinaire'', 16 October, 1911, p. 44], Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt; It was not only the first Cubist portrait, according to Apollinaire, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public, prior to others by [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Mikhail Larionov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-portrait-de-guillaume-apollin-4911615-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=4911615&amp;sid=bf281115-cf70-463b-ad5c-c027467afb4c Jean Metzinger, 1910, ''Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire'', Christie's Paris, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes and Metzinger become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

[[Jean Metzinger]]'s 1905-1906 [[Fauvism|Fauvist]]-[[Divisionism|divisionist]] technique, too, had its parallel in literature. For him, there was an emblematic alliance between the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] writers and [[Neo-Impressionism]]. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word or 'syllable'. Together the cubes of pigments formed sentences or 'phrases', translating various emotions. This is an important aspect of Metzinger's early work, proto-Cubist work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Prior to the advent of Cubism Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with [[Paul Cézanne|Cézannian]] perspective, beyond not just the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], but beyond too the preoccupations of his avant-garde entourage.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature." (Metzinger, 1907)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Gino Severini, 1911, La Danseuse Obsedante (The Haunting Dancer, Ruhelose Tanzerin), oil on canvas, 73.5 x 54 cm, private collection.jpg|thumb|[[Gino Severini]], 1911, ''La danseuse obsedante (The Haunting Dancer, Ruhelose Tanzerin)'', oil on canvas, 73.5 x 54 cm, private collection]]
An interpretation of this statement was made by Robert L. Herbert: "What Metzinger meant is that each little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane where mere size and direction are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement." (Herbert, 1968)&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jean Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvallières, ''La Grande Revue'', vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

During Metzinger's [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] period (see ''[[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]'', 1905–06), each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger described as the 'total image'.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Impressionism===
[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1906-07, ''Paysage au disque'', oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Musée national d'art moderne (MNAM), [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris]]
"Artists of the years 1910-1914, including Mondrian and Kandinsky as well as the Cubists", writes Robert Herbert, "took support from one of its central principles: that line and color have the ability to communicate certain emotions to the observer, independently of natural form." He continues, "Neo-Impressionist color theory had an important heir in the person of Robert Delaunay. He had been a Neo-Impressionist in the Fauve period, and knew intimately the writings of Signac and Henry. His famous solar discs of 1912 and 1913 are descended from the Neo-Impressionists' concentration upon the decomposition of spectral light."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The height of Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay painted portraits of one another in prominent rectangles of pigment. In the sky of Metzinger's ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1]]'', 1906–1907 (Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller), is the solar disk which Delaunay was later (during his Cubist and Orphist phases) to make into a personal emblem.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's ''Paysage au disque'', "is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..." (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, Jean Metzinger, ''Coucher de soleil No. 1''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524204851/http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap |date=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger, followed closely by Delaunay—the two often painting together in 1906 and 1907—would develop a new style of Neo-Impressionism incorporating large cubic brushstrokes within highly geometrized compositions that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Both [[Gino Severini]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Cubo-Divisionist technique between 1909 and 1911. The [[Futurists]] later (1911–1916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of [[Gino Severini]]'s Parisian works, into their 'dynamic' paintings and sculpture.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;
 
"The Neo-Impressionists" according to Maurice Denis, "inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Robert Herbert writes, of the changes occurring in the early 20th century: "By about 1904, the resolution of the dilemma was made in favor of the abstract side of the equation. "Harmony means sacrifice", Cross said, and much of early Neo-Impressionism was jettisoned. Although they paid lip service to their established theory, Signac and Cross now painted in enormous strokes which could never pretend to mix in the eye, and which did not even retain nuance of tone. Raw, bold yellows, magentas, reds, blues, and greens sprang forth from their canvases, making them as free of the trammels of nature as any painting then being done in Europe."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Where the dialectic nature of Cézanne's work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of proto-Cubism, between 1908 and 1910, the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of the Cubists from 1911.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

[[File:Georges Seurat, 1889-90, Le Chahut, Kröller-Müller Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Georges Seurat]], 1889-90, ''[[Le Chahut]]'', oil on canvas, 171.5 x 140.5 cm (66 7/8 x 54 3/4 in), [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], [[Otterlo]], [[Netherlands]]]]
"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910-1911," Herbert continues, "questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. The Chahut [Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo] was called by André Salmon "one of the great icons of the new devotion", and both it and the ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque (Circus)]]'', Musée d'Orsay, Paris, according to [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], "almost belong to Synthetic Cubism".&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The concept was well established among the French artists that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form; and this mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling 'objective truth,' perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses both problems in ''Circus'' and ''Dancers''). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics ([[Orphism (art)|Orphism]]) would do so with color too.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

With the exception of Picasso (his Blue and Pink periods being entirely different intellectually), all the leading Cubists and Futurists came from Neo-Impressionism, believing its objective validity to be a scientific discovery. It was in part this scientific basis that left the avant-garde artists vulnerable to the critique of scientific objectivity, of the type developed first by [[Immanuel Kant]], then [[Ernst Mach]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and of course [[Albert Einstein]]; in relation to, for example, the treatment of time as the fourth dimension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/othertxts/miller Peter Brooke, ''Letter to Arthur Miller'', A commentary on Arthur Miller's ''Einstein - Picasso: Space, Time and the beauty that causes havoc'', Basic Books, New York, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

===African, Egyptian, Greek, Iberian &amp; Oceanic art===
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']]
Another factor in the shift towards abstraction could be found burgeoning in art circles during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Europeans were discovering [[Prehistoric art]], along with art produced by a variety of cultures: [[African art]], [[Cycladic art]], [[Oceanic art]], [[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Art of the Americas]], the [[Art of ancient Egypt]], [[Iberian sculpture]], and [[Iberian schematic art]]. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Rousseau]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and stylistic simplicity of those cultures.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up ''The Cubist Epoch''], London: Phaidon in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art &amp; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1970. {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1906, Picasso met Matisse through [[Gertrude Stein]], at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in [[Tribal art]], [[Iberian sculpture]] and [[African tribal masks]]. They became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to Picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of ethnographic art. Picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as proto-Cubism, as ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', the [[Antecedent (genealogy)|antecedent]] of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

The African influence, which introduced anatomical simplifications and expressive features, is another generally assumed starting point for the Proto-Cubism of Picasso. He began working on studies for [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] after a visit to the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadero. [[Pierre Daix]], explored Picasso’s Cubism from a formal position in relation to the ideas and works of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] on the subject of myth. Without doubt, writes Podoksik, Picasso’s proto-Cubism—coming as it did not from the external appearance of events and things, but from great emotional and instinctive feelings, from the most profound layers of the psyche—clairvoyantly (as Rimbaud would have said) arrived at the suprapersonal and thereby borders on the archaic mythological consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W09TW-75Be0C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=%22proto-cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0lE4CdAuFA&amp;sig=BS3eQQafhGRg3p46AVQc3YjAMfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r48qUevONcLRhAfZyYH4Dw&amp;ved=0CHUQ6AEwHQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proto-cubism%22&amp;f=false Victoria Charles, ''Pablo Picasso'', Parkstone International, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zsHayTqUCTsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Pierre+Daix,+rimbaud,+picasso,+conscience+mythologie+archaïques&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2gmkbih4Ru&amp;sig=MgG93AripQUGLBdWvvcYc69dIiI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ldAsUbGDFIeS0QWHq4HYBQ&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pierre%20Daix%2C%20rimbaud%2C%20picasso%2C%20conscience%20mythologie%20archaïques&amp;f=false Anatoli Podoksik, Victoria Charles, ''Pablo Picasso'', Parkstone International, 2011], {{ISBN|978-1-78042-285-5}} (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

European artists (and art collectors) prized these objects for their stylistic traits defined as attributes of primitive expression: absence of classical perspective, simple outlines and shapes, presence of symbolic signs including the [[hieroglyph]], emotive figural distortions, and the dynamic rhythms generated by repetitive ornamental patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau, Abigail, ''Going Native: Paul Gauguin and the Invention of Primitivist Modernism'', in ''The Expanded Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', N. Broude and M. Garrard (Eds.). New York: Harper Collins, 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the profound energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceana, the Americas, that attracted the Parisian avant-garde.

[[File:Paul Gauguin, 1894, Oviri (Sauvage), partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Gauguin]], 1894, ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri (Sauvage)]]'', partially glazed stoneware, 75 x 19 x 27 cm, Musée d'Orsay, Paris]]
The works of [[Paul Gauguin]] had achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris following the powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in 1903 and 1906. Picasso's paintings of monumental figures from 1906 were directly influenced by the paintings, sculptures and writings of Gauguin. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to ''Les Demoiselles'' in 1907. According to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin's work in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio, both a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work, had several of Gauguin's works on hand, in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his [[Work of art|oeuvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Sweetman"&gt;David Sweetman, ''Paul Gauguin, A life'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995. {{ISBN|0-684-80941-9}}, 562-563&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] wrote,
:"The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor."&lt;ref&gt;John A. Richardson, ''A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26665-1}}, 1991, 461&lt;/ref&gt;

Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin's ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri]]'' (literally meaning 'savage'), a gruesome phallic representation of the Tahitian goddess of life and death intended for Gauguin's grave. First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on ''Les Demoiselles.'' Sweetman writes, "Gauguin's statue ''Oviri,'' which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''."&lt;ref name="Sweetman" /&gt;

Many artists associated with [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]] and [[Fauvism]] transited through a proto-Cubist period, while some delved deeper into the problems of geometric abstraction, becoming known as Cubists, others chose different paths. And not all underwent the transformation by passing through the [[Primitivism|Primitivist]] phase.

====Chronophotography====
[[File:Kiss, animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 444 by Eadweard Muybridge.gif|thumb|left|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1887, ''Kiss'', animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 444]]
The [[Chronophotography]] of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] had a profound influence on the beginnings of Cubism and Futurism. These photographic motion studies particularly interested artists that would later form a groups known as the [[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]] and [[Section d'Or]], including Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes and Marcel Duchamp. A predecessor to cinematography and moving film, chronophotography involved a series or succession of different images, originally created and used for the scientific study of movement. These studies would directly influence [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2|Nu descendant un escalier n° 2]]''&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin (1996). Duchamp: A Biography. U.S.: Henry Holt and Company, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8050-5789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could also be read into Metzinger's work of 1910-12, though rather than simultaneously superimposing successive images to depict the motion, Metzinger represents the subject at rest viewed from multiple angles; the dynamic role is played by the artist rather than the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/marey/?do=fic&amp;idn=P345 Étienne-Jules Marey, ''La Science du mouvement et l'image du temps''], (The Science of mouvement and the image of time)&lt;/ref&gt;

Eadweard Muybridge's sequential photography of movements broken down frame by frame produced in the late 19th century depicting a wide variety of subjects in motion, were known in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Muybridge often traveled to Europe to promote his work and he met Étienne-Jules Marey in 1881. His freeze-framed images evoked time and motion. Displayed in a grid, the subject is captured in split-second intervals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Helios.html?id=bwBMAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Philip Brookman, ''Helios: Eadweard Muybridge in a Time of Change'', Corcoran Gallery of Art] in Washington, DC, 2010 {{ISBN|978-3-86521-926-8}} (Steidl).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2010/04/13/125899013/muybridge-the-man-who-made-pictures-move [[Neda Ulaby]], ''Muybridge: The Man Who Made Pictures Move'', 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Eadweard_Muybridge.html?id=VIUaQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Philip Brookman, with contributions by Marta Braun, Andy Grundberg, Corey Keller and Rebecca Solnit, ''Eadweard Muybridge'', San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate Pub., 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Katherine Kuh, Marcel Duchamp spoke about his work and its relation to the photographic motion studies of Muybridge and Marey:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The idea of describing the movement of a nude coming downstairs while still retaining static visual means to do this, particularly interested me. The fact that I had seen chronophotographs of fencers in action and horse galloping (what we today call stroboscopic photography) gave me the idea for the ''Nude''. It doesn't mean that I copied these photographs. The Futurists were also interested in somewhat the same idea, though I was never a Futurist. And of course the motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing then too. The whole idea of movement, of speed, was in the air."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warholstars.org/abstractexpressionism/artists/duchamp/marcelduchamp.html Katherine Kuh, ''Marcel Duchamp'', interview broadcast on the BBC program 'Monitor', 29 March 1961, published in Katherine Kuh (ed.), ''The Artist's Voice.

Between 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, capturing the interest of artists at home and abroad. In 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, learning about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favoured the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative, while Muybridge used multiple cameras to produce separate images that could be projected by his zoopraxiscope.&lt;ref name=Brookman&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=Philip|title=Helios : Eadweard Muybridge in a time of change|year=2010|publisher=Steidl|location=[Göttingen, Germany]|isbn=9783865219268|page=93|author2=Marta Braun |author3=Andy Grundberg |author4=Corey Keller |author5=Rebecca Solnit }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, Muybridge's photos were published as a massive portfolio comprising 781 plates and 20,000 photographs in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.&lt;ref name=UPennArchive&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] "The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study"&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later work, Muybridge was influenced by, and in turn influenced the French photographer [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]. In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.&lt;ref name=Brookman91&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookman|first=Philip|title=Helios : Eadweard Muybridge in a time of change|year=2010|publisher=Steidl|location=[Göttingen, Germany]|isbn=9783865219268|page=91|author2=Marta Braun |author3=Andy Grundberg |author4=Corey Keller |author5=Rebecca Solnit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple exposure sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called "Marey wheel" camera.

[[File:Marey- Man walking, 1890–91.jpg|thumb|left|[[Étienne-Jules Marey]], 1890–91, ''Homme qui marche (Man Walking)'', [[Chronophotography]]]]
While Marey's scientific achievements in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]] are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic than scientific.&lt;ref name=Adam14&gt;{{cite book|last=Adam, (ed.)|first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=Köln|isbn=9783836509411|page=14|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled extensively, giving numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the "Science of Animal Locomotion" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public, making the Hall the first commercial [[movie theater]].&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite book| last = Clegg| first = Brian| title = The Man Who Stopped Time| publisher = [[Joseph Henry Press]]| year = 2007| isbn = 0-309-10112-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marey also made movies. His chronophotographic gun (1882) was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, and the most interesting fact is that all the frames were recorded on the same picture. Using these pictures he studied a great variety of animals. Some call it Marey’s "animated zoo". Marey also studied human [[animal locomotion|locomotion]]. He published several books including ''Le Mouvement'' in 1894.

His movies were at a high speed of 60 images per second and of excellent image quality: coming close to perfection in slow-motion cinematography. His research on how to capture and display moving images helped the emerging field of [[cinematography]].

Towards the turn of the century he returned to studying the movement of quite abstract forms, like a falling ball. His last great work, executed just before the outbreak of Fauvism in Paris, was the observation and photography of smoke trails. This research was partially funded by [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] under the auspices of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], after the two met in [[Paris]] at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]].

====Philosophical, scientific and social motivations====
To justify such a radical move towards the depiction of the world in unrecognizable terms, Antliff and Leighten argue that the emergence of Cubism transpired during an era of dissatisfaction with [[positivism]], [[materialism]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century theories upon which such philosophies were based, came under attack by intellectuals such as the philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[William James]] and the mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. New philosophical and scientific ideas emerged based on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available popularized publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism. Popularized too were new scientific discoveries such as [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]]'s [[X-ray]]s, [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertzian]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[radio waves]] propagating through space, revealing realities not only hidden from human observation, but beyond the sphere of [[sensory perception]]. Perception was no longer associated solely with the static, passive receipt of visible signals, but became dynamically shaped by [[Perceptual learning|learning]], [[memory]] and [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]].&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gregory, "Perception" in Gregory, Zangwill (1987) pp. 598–601&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;Linda D. Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art'', Princeton University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1881 and 1882 Poincaré wrote a series of works titled ''On curves defined by differential equations'' within which he built a new branch of mathematics called "qualitative theory of differential equations". Poincaré showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found (from the very form of the equation). He investigated the nature of trajectories of integral curves in a plane; classifying singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introducing the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction – the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of [[mathematical physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century Vol = 3. page = 283 {{ISBN|978-3764358457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolmogorov, AP Yushkevich, Mathematics of the 19th century. pages = 162–174&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Poincaré, following [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and others, viewed geometric models as mere conventions rather than as absolute. [[Euclidean geometry]], upon which traditional [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] had been founded, was but one geometric configuration among others. [[Non-Euclidean geometry]], with its hyperbolic or spherically curved space, was thus, at the very least, an equally valid alternative. This discovery in the world of mathematics overthrew 2000 years of seeming absolutes in Euclidean geometry, and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multi-dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt;

Pictorial space could now be transformed in response to the artists own subjectivity (expressing primal impulses, irrespective of classical perspective and Beaux Arts artistic expectations). "Adherence to subjectivity in turn" write Antliff and Leighten, "signalled a radical break from past pictorial conventions in favour of a Nietzschean expression of individual will".&lt;ref name=" Antliff, Leighten" /&gt;

Poincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that 'understood' them and that no theory could be considered 'true'. "The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality", Poincaré wrote in his 1902 ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]''.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

[[Maurice Princet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Arthur I. |title=Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time, and the Beauty That Causes Havoc |year=2001 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=0-465-01860-2 |pages=171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French [[mathematician]] and [[actuary]] who played a role in the birth of [[Cubism]]. An associate of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Juan Gris]] and later [[Marcel Duchamp]], Princet became known as "le mathématicien du cubisme" ("the mathematician of cubism").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=100 |isbn=0-465-01859-9 }} Miller cites:

[[File:Jouffret.gif|right|thumb|An illustration from Jouffret's ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions''. The book, which influenced Picasso, was given to him by Princet.]]
Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to artists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Princet brought to the attention of Picasso, Metzinger and others, a book by [[Esprit Jouffret]], ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/traitlmentaired00joufgoog/page/n9 Jouffret, Esprit, ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions''], 1903, (in French) archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional surface. Picasso's sketchbooks for ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' illustrate Jouffret's influence on the artist's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=106–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Princet's wife left him for [[André Derain]], and he drifted away from the circle of artists at the Bateau-Lavoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Robbin |title=Shadows of Reality, The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-11039-1 |pages=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Princet remained close to Metzinger and would soon participate in meetings of the [[Section d'Or]] in [[Puteaux]]. He gave informal lectures to the group, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |pages=312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet's influence on the Cubists was attested to by [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]: "I witnessed the birth of cubism, its growth, its decline. Picasso was the obstetrician, Guillaume Apollinaire the midwife, Princet the godfather."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vlaminck |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice de Vlaminck |date=June 6, 1942 |title=Opinions libres... sur la peinture |journal=Comédia |pages=1, 6 |quote=J'ai assisté à la naissance du cubisme, à sa croissance, à son déclin.

[[Louis Vauxcelles]] along similar lines dubbed Princet, sarcastically, the 'father of Cubism': "M. Princet has studied at length non-Euclidean geometry and the theorems of Riemann, of which Gleizes and Metzinger speak rather carelessly. Now then, M. Princet one day met M. Max Jacob and confided him one or two of his discoveries relating to the fourth dimension. M. Jacob informed the ingenious M. Picasso of it, and M. Picasso saw there a possibility of new ornamental schemes. M. Picasso explained his intentions to M. Apollinaire, who hastened to write them up in formularies and codify them. The thing spread and propagated. Cubism, the child of M. Princet, was born".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vauxcelles |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Vauxcelles |date=December 29, 1918 |title=Le Carnet des ateliers: La Père du cubisme |journal=Le Carnet de la semaine |pages=11 }} in {{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Linda Dalrymple |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art |year=1983 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-10142-6 |page=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger, in 1910, wrote of Princet: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |pages=60 }} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often. Although quite young, thanks to his knowledge of mathematics he had an important job in an insurance company. But, beyond his profession, it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |location=Paris |isbn= |pages=43–44 }} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |pages=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Bergson, James, Stein====
The nineteenth-century positivists concept of measurable deterministic time became untenable as [[Henri Bergson]] exposed his radical idea that the human experience of time was a creative process associated with biological evolution. He rejected the division of space into separate measurable units. Both Bergson and [[William James]] described the intellect as an instrumental tool, a by-product of evolution. The intellect was no longer considered a cognitive faculty able to grasp reality in an impartial manner. Instead, argued Bergson, we should rely on intuition to inspired creative insights in both the sciences and the arts. His third major work, ''Creative Evolution'', the most widely known and most discussed of his books, appeared in 1907, constituting one of the most profound and original contributions to the philosophical consideration of evolution. The proto-Cubists would have known of his work through, amongst others, [[Gertrude Stein]] a student of William James. Stein had recently purchased, following the 1905 [[Salon d'Automne]], Matisse's ''[[Woman with a Hat]] (La femme au chapeau)''&lt;ref&gt;Matisse's ''Woman with a Hat'' is now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&lt;/ref&gt; and Picasso's ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers''.&lt;ref&gt;Color plates of ''Young Girl with Basket of Flowers'', or ''Jeune fille aux fleurs'', appear in Hobhouse, 1975, at 68 and Burns, 1970, at 8. The painting now in a private collection was displayed in a 2003 Matisse/Picasso exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt; With James's supervision, Stein and fellow student, Leon Mendez Solomons, performed experiments on ''normal motor automatism'', a phenomenon hypothesized to occur in people when their attention is divided between two simultaneous intelligent activities such as writing and speaking, yielding examples of writing that appeared to represent "[[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Has Gertrude Stein a Secret?"

Disposed to accept the unorthodox in life and art, and naturally tolerant of eccentricity, Gertrude Stein had accommodated the tendency of her Parisian contemporaries of spend their time and talent looking for ways to [[Épater la bourgeoisie]]. According to the American poet and literary critic [[John Malcolm Brinnin]], this was "a society committed to the systematic outraging of every rule".&lt;ref name="Brinnin"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/thirdrose030726mbp John Malcolm Brinnin, ''The Third Rose, Gertrude Stein and Her World'', An Atlantic Monthly Press Book, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, Toronto, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso's famous dinner party for [[Henri Rousseau|Le Douanier Rousseau]] was an eye-opening event in the proto-Cubist period. ''Le Banquet Rousseau'', "one of the most notable social events of the twentieth century", writes Brinnin, "was neither an orgiastic occasion nor even an opulent one. Its subsequent fame grew from the fact that it was a colorful happening within a revolutionary art movement at a point of that movement's earliest success, and from the fact that it was attended by individuals whose separate influences radiated like spokes of creative light across the art world for generations."&lt;ref name="Brinnin" /&gt;

[[:fr:Maurice Raynal|Maurice Raynal]], in ''Les Soires de Paris'', 15 January 1914, p.&amp;nbsp;69, wrote about "Le Banquet Rousseau".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LQUeVH8Sh4oC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=André+Salmon,+%22banquet+Rousseau%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ievCA-jlLA&amp;sig=WaLalYMO1ksgzL1xbpL6yvyTghw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W6wvUc6VFMjV0QXysICwDA&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=banquet%20Rousseau&amp;f=false Ann Temkin, ''Rousseau: The Dream'', The Museum of Modern Art, July 31, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Years later the French writer [[André Salmon]] recalled the setting of the illustrious banquet; Picasso's studio at [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]]:

:"Here the nights of the Blue Period passed... here the days of the Rose Period flowered... here the Demoiselles d'Avignon halted in their dance to re-group themselves in accordance with the golden number and the secret of the fourth dimension... here fraternized the poets elevated by serious criticism into the School of the Rue Ravignan... here in these shadowy corridors lived the true worshippers of fire ... here one evening in the year 1908 unrolled the pageantry of the first and last banquet offered by his admirers to the painter Henri Rousseau called the Douanier."&lt;ref name="Monet to Moore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinnin" /&gt;

Guests at the ''banquet Rousseau'' of 1908, in addition to Picasso and the guest of honor, included [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Salmon]], [[:fr:Maurice Raynal|Maurice Raynal]], [[Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler]], [[Leo Stein]] and [[Gertrude Stein]].&lt;ref name="Monet to Moore" /&gt;

No observer, either academic or independent, could have mistaken the direction of change taken by the avant-garde between 1906 and 1910. The fundamental shift away from nature within artistic circles had advanced to the status of ''revolt'', in far-reaching ways, diverging significantly from the developments of Cézanne or Seurat. The symptoms of that shift during the first decade of the 20th century are countless and redoubtable, bursting practically overnight, and were soon to be perceived by the reactionary adversaries as no more than grotesque, incomprehensible, to be considered with haughty amusement.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

==The Wild Men of Paris==
Leading up to 1910, one year before the scandalous group exhibiting that brought "Cubism" to the attention of the general public for the first time, the draftsman, illustrator and poet, [[Gelett Burgess]], interviewed and wrote about artists and artworks in and around Paris. After his visit to the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]], the well-established anti-establishment art exhibition at this time peppered with proto-Cubist works, he wrote in humorist fashion:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;There were no limits to the audacity and the ugliness of the canvasses. Still-life sketches of round, round apples and yellow, yellow oranges, on square, square tables, seen in impossible perspective; landscapes of squirming trees, with blobs of virgin color gone wrong, fierce greens and coruscating yellows, violent purples, sickening reds and shuddering blues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But the nudes! They looked like flayed Martians, like pathological charts—hideous old women, patched with gruesome hues, lopsided, with arms like the arms of a Swastika, sprawling on vivid backgrounds, or frozen stiffly upright, glaring through misshapen eyes, with noses or fingers missing. They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself!&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, Wild Men of Paris, The Architectural Record, May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Matisse's ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)]]'' appeared at the 1907 Indépendants, entitled ''Tableau no. III''. Vauxcelles writes on the topic of ''Nu bleu'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I admit to not understanding. An ugly nude woman is stretched out upon grass of an opaque blue under the palm trees...

''Blue Nude'' would later create a sensation at the [[Armory Show]] of 1913 in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Matisse, Henri." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting, already a certain distance from Fauvism, was deemed so ugly students burned it in effigy at the 1913 Armory Show in Chicago, where it had toured from New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2010/11/the-response-to-matisses-blue-nude/ Tyler Green, Modern Art Notes, ''The Response to Matisse's Blue Nude'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the works of Matisse, Derain and Braque, the Indépendants of 1907 included six works (each) by Vlaminck, Dufy, Metzinger, Delaunay, Camoin, Herbin, Puy, Valtat, and three by Marquet.

Vaucelles described this group of 'Fauves':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A movement I consider dangerous (despite the great sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; a few dozen innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes in the name of I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet.

The dance theme passed through several stages in Matisse's work prior to this canvas. Only here, however, did it acquire its famous passion and expressive resonance. The frenzy of the pagan bacchanalia is embodied in the powerful, stunning accord of red, blue and green, uniting Man, Heaven and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/fcgi-bin/db2www/descrPage.mac/descrPage?selLang=English&amp;indexClass=PICTURE_EN&amp;Query_Exp=%28WOA_TYPE+%3D%3D+%22Painting%22%29+AND+%28WOA_AUTHOR+%3D%3D+%22Matisse%2C+Henri%22%29&amp;PID=GJ-9673&amp;numView=1&amp;ID_NUM=8&amp;thumbFile=%2Ftmplobs%2FD2IQ47M%24BWXA34AL6.jpg&amp;embViewVer=noEmb&amp;comeFrom=browse&amp;check=false&amp;sorting=WOA_AUTHOR%5EWOA_NAME&amp;thumbId=6&amp;numResults=38&amp;author=Matisse%2C%26%2332%3BHenri Henri Matisse, 1909-10, ''The Dance'', Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.

Many of Cézanne's paintings had been exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, 1905 and 1906. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of a retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1907, greatly attracting interest and affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris prior to the advent of [[Cubism]]. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired not just Matisse, Derain, Braque and Metzinger, but the other artists who exhibited earlier with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, experimented, too, with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development [[modern art]] of the 20th century.

Gelett Burgess writes in ''The Wild Men of Paris'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called "The Invertebrates." In the Salon of 1905 they were named "The Incoherents." But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of "Les Fauves"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly. Matisse himself, serious, plaintive, a conscientious experimenter, whose works are but studies in expression, who is concerned at present with but the working out of the theory of simplicity, denies all responsibility for the excesses of his unwelcome disciples."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

"Picasso, keen as a whip, spirited as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to his studio and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse shakes his head and does not smile! He chats thoughtfully of the "Harmony and volume" and "architectural values," and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burgess, turning his attention to Metzinger, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis3.asp Gelett Burgess, ''The Wild Men of Paris'', The Architectural Record, May 1910, documents p. 3, Interview with Jean Metzinger, circa 1908-09]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Metzinger, in his ''Cubism was Born'', published years later, Cubism had been born out of the "need not for an intellectual art but for an art that would be something other than a systematic absurdity"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in [[trompe l'oeil]] on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. "Quite clearly" Metzinger notes, "nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common..." Already, in 1906, "it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model".&lt;ref name="Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Le Cubisme était Né: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger'' (Cubism was Born), Présence, Chambéry, 1972. (This text written by Jean Metzinger was supplied to the publisher Henri Viaud by Metzinger's widow Suzanne Phocas). Translation Peter Brooke&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for Picasso... the tradition he came from had prepared him better than ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we had no intention of prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The illusion had been maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence of those whose job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare to look at a Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Metzinger, the "entirely intuitive dissociation" between color of the Fauves and form of classical painting, exemplified in the works of [[Raoul Dufy]] (who paints first, then draws), "foreshadowed, more perhaps than Cézanne or black African art, not just Cubism but all the painting that followed afterward".&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had measured the difference that separated art prior to 1900 from the art which I felt was being born. I knew that all instruction was at an end. The age of personal expression had finally begun. The value of an artist was no longer to be judged by the finish of his execution, or by the analogies his work suggested with such-and-such an archetype. It would be judged – exclusively – by what distinguished this artist from all the others. The age of the master and pupil was finally over; I could see about me only a handful of creators and whole colonies of monkeys. (Jean Metzinger, Cubism was Born)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From his [[Montmartre]] studio on the rue Lamarck to Picasso's Bateau Lavoir studio on the rue Ravignan, writes Metzinger, "the attempt [''prétention''] to imitate an orb on a vertical plane, or to indicate by a horizontal straight line the circular hole of a vase placed at the height of the eyes was considered as the artifice of an illusionistic trickery that belonged to another age."&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted an art that was faithful to itself and would have nothing to do with the business of creating illusions. I dreamed of painting glasses from which no-one would ever think of drinking, beaches that would be quite unsuitable for bathing, nudes who would be definitively chaste. I wanted an art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible. (Jean Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Jean Metzinger]] between 1905 and 1907 painted in a Divisionist style with large squares or rectangular planes of color (see Metzinger's ''[[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]'' and ''[[La danse, Bacchante]]''). The size and direction of each plane are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting, yet color can vary independently of size and placement. This form of Divisionism was a significant step beyond the preoccupations of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]]. Writing in 1906, the art critic Louis Chassevent recognized the difference and, as [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] pointed out in his Gleizes Guggenheim catalogue, used the word "cube" which would later be taken up by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to baptize Cubism. Chassevent writes: 
:"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]".&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent: ''Les Artistes indépendantes'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''22e Salon des Indépendants'', 1906, ''Quelques petits salons'', Paris, 1908, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R.

The history of the word "cube" goes back at least to May 1901 when Jean Béral, reviewing Cross's Neo-Impressionist work at the Indépendants in ''Art et Littérature'' commented that he "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. One even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments."&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

During the month of March, 1905, Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the Salon des Indépendants, published on the front page of Gil Blas, writes: "M. Metzinger, still very young, mimics his elders with the candor of a child throwing handfuls of multicolored confetti; his « point », very big, gives his paintings the appearance of a mosaic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7528616k/f1.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'' (front page article), Gil Blas, No. 9295, A27, 23 March 1905], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 Metzinger formed a close friendship with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by Louis Vauxcelles in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anonymous review of the 1908 Salon des Indépendants published in Le Matin, Metzinger is accused of making "a salad of Maurice Denis and Egyptian bas-reliefs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5686418/f2.image Salon des Indépendants, Le Matin, Numéro 8788, 20 March 1908], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Vauxcelles again, in his review of [[Georges Braque]]'s exhibition at Kanhweiler's gallery called Braque a daring man who despises form, "reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7521008s/f2.item Louis Vauxcelles, Exposition Braques, Gil Blas, 14 November 1908], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danchev"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iTzniDD6EwAC&amp;pg=PR123&amp;lpg=PR123&amp;dq=preface,+Exposition+Georges+Braque,+November+1908,+Galerie+Kahnweiler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DZ4-_FKVK0&amp;sig=RjxOvhE7jDIbKCa4h8QkIRsoKnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCcxUfLbKa6A0AXIhoGADA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20cubes&amp;f=false Alex Danchev, ''Georges Braques: A Life'', Arcade Publishing, 15 November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vauxcelles recounts how Matisse told him at the time, "Braque has just sent in [to the 1908 Salon d'Automne] a painting made of little cubes".&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt; The critic Charles Morice relayed Matisse's words and spoke of Braque's little cubes. The motif of the viaduct at l'Estaque had inspired Braque to produce three paintings marked by the simplification of form and deconstruction of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;''Futurism in Paris - The Avant-garde Explosion'', Pompidou Center, Paris 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 1909, Vauxcelles qualifies the works of Braque exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] as "bizarreries cubiques" (cubic oddities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7536065n Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon des Indépendants'', Gil Blas, 25 March 1909], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Vauxcelles, this time in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants, published 19 March 1910 in Le Petit Parisien, art critic Jean Claude pejoratively combined the terms "Metzinger-le-cubique".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563551x/f2.image Jean Claude, La Vie Artistique, ''Au Salon des Indépendants'', Le Petit Parisien, Numéro 12194, 19 March 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso's works are exhibited at a small gallery run by the German collector-dealer [[Wilhelm Uhde]] in May 1910 (cited in Fry 58 and Robbins 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;12, 22). The exhibition is reviewed by Léon Werth, who used the adjective 'cubic' to describe Picasso's treatment of roofs and chimneys.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

In a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne published in L'Ouest-Éclair, a journalist (J.B.) employs the term 'Cubism' demeaningly (several months prior to the popularization of the term):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now a note on the grotesque: Among all these "fauves"—the name given to the Impressionists in conventional workshops—the most "fauve" of all is certainly Jean Metzinger, the defender of ''Cubism''. Cubism is a style of painting inspired by puzzles or these popular guessing-game designs for children found in certain newspapers, which consist of finding, for example, a hare pursued by a hunter in the landscape accessories. That's how "Cubism" proceeds. Under the title of ''Nu'' [''Nude''], Jean Metzinger shows us "cubes" of various tones, but of the same color. The trick is to find the head, the arms at different points on the canvas. It's a distraction like any other, but it is not art. This is the latest cry of pictorial craziness [''loufoquerie picturale''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6426734/f2.image ''Le Salon d'Automne, La Bretagne et les Peinture Bretonnes'', L'Ouest-Éclair (Rennes), 5 October 1910], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne, published in ''La Presse'', art critique Edmond Epardaud writes of the 'geometric follies' of Metzinger, and describes both Gleizes and Le Fauconnier as 'specious architects' (''architectes fallacieux'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k596525z/f2.image Edmond Epardaud, ''On Inaugure demain le Salon d'Automne'', La Presse, 30 September 1910, Numéro 6675, pp. 1, 2], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic Jean Claude writes in his review of the same salon, with reference to Metzinger's ''[[Nu à la cheminée]]'', published in ''Le Petit Parisien'', "Metzinger painted a puzzle, cubic and triangular, which after verification, is a naked woman. I managed to discover the head, torso and legs. I had to give up finding arms. This is beyond comprehension".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563747g/f5.image Jean Claude, ''Grand Palais, Le Salon d'Automne'', Le Petit Parisien, 2 October 1910, Numéro 12391, p. 5], Gallica (BnF)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Cézanne was "the point of departure for these mad explorers," [[Gelett Burgess]] writes, "It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly." Picasso, at the time, painted a nude woman "composed entirely of triangles". Braque "builds an architectural monster which he names woman". Braque was, according to Burgess, "the originator of architectural nudes with square feet, as square as boxes, with right-angled shoulders". Derain, "a co-experimenter," writes Burgess, "moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!"&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;

In his 1912 ''Anecdotal History of Cubism'' [[André Salmon]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay painted landscapes planted with cottages reduced to the severe appearance of [[parallelepiped]]s. Living less of an interior life than Picasso, remaining to all outward appearances more like painters than their precursor, these young artists were in a much greater hurry for results, though they be less complete. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exhibited, their works passed almost unobserved by the public and by art critics, who...recognized only the Fauves, whether it be to praise or to curse to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the king of the Fauves... Henri Matisse... with one word cast out Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay from the family. With that feminine sense of the appropriate, the basis of his taste, he baptized the cottages of the two painters, "Cubist." An ingenuous or ingenious art critic was with him. He ran to his newspaper and with style wrote the gospel article; the next day the public learned of the birth of Cubism.

The word "cube" for Chassevent in 1906, with regard to the large, thickly painted, and highly geometrized paintings of Metzinger and Delaunay, did not imply a movement. Nor did the word "cube" for Vauxcelles hold any special meaning two and a half years later when he wrote (in November 1908) a brief passage about Braque's landscapes exhibited at the Kahnweiler gallery: "He scorns forms, reduces all sites and figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes":&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

:"In neither case" notes Daniel Robbins, "did the use of the word "cube" lead to the immediate identification of the artists with a new pictorial attitude, with a movement. The word was no more than an isolated descriptive epithet that, in both cases, was prompted by a visible passion for structure so assertive that the critics were wrenched, momentarily, from their habitual concentration on motifs and subjects, in which context their comments on drawing, color, tonality, and, only occasionally, conception, resided." (Robbins, 1985)&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

In light of the headway made by Cézanne, the multiple use of the word "cube" with reference to diverse works by diverse artists, and the other factors involved (political, social, cultural), it has been suggested that Cubism, with its proto-phase, would have emerged regardless of Picasso's intervention. The art historian and collector Douglas Cooper viewed Cubist painting to have been the beginning of a stylistic revolution which was inevitable. The American art scholar and MoMA curator [[William Rubin]] argued that Braque, with his commitment to a Cézannist syntax, would have created early Cubism had Picasso never existed.&lt;ref name="Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=Cubism,+mobile+perspective&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm_znb7YtG&amp;sig=8jHfIJBskeVW31AU_0hqno0HLBY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=revolution%20that%20was%20inevitable&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and its Histories'', Manchester University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. Georges Braque's 1908 ''[[Houses at L’Estaque]]'' (and related works) prompted the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to refer to ''bizarreries cubiques'' (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as ''Reservoir at Horta de Ebro'' or ''Brick factory at Tortosa'', as the first Cubist paintings.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

According to the personal predilections of Kahnweiler, Picasso's [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] was the beginning of Cubism, and yet he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in 1907 Picasso began a strange large painting depicting women, fruit and drapery, which he left unfinished. It cannot be called other than unfinished, even though it represents a long period of work. Begun in the spirit of the works of 1906, it contains in one section the endeavors of 1907 and thus never constitutes a unified whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The nudes, with large, quiet eyes, stand rigid, like mannequins. Their stiff, round bodies are flesh-colored, black and white. That is the style of 1906.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In the foreground, however, alien to the style of the rest of the painting, appear a crouching figure and a bowl of fruit. These forms are drawn angularly, not roundly modeled in chiaroscuro. The colors are luscious blue, strident yellow, next to pure black and white. This is the beginning of Cubism, the first upsurge, a desperate titanic clash with all of the problems at once. (Kahnweiler, 1920)&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/riseofcubism00kahn Daniel Henry Kahnweiler, The rise of cubism (Der Weg zum Kubismus)'', New York, Wittenborn, Schultz. This is the first translation of the original German text entitled "Der Weg zum Kubismus", Munich, Delphin-Verlag, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
And Cottington following through notes that "the problems were quite unrelated, however, to the picture's subject of an encounter with five naked staring whores (even though Kahnweiler's choice of adjectives seems to have registered its affect)".&lt;ref name="Cottington" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These problems were the basic tasks of painting: to represent three dimensions and color on a flat surface, and to comprehend them in the unity of that surface... Not the simulation of form by chiaroscuro, but the depiction of the three dimensional through drawing on a flat surface...(Kahnweiler, 1920)&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kahnweiler's conclusion, similar to those leveled against Cézanne, was that Picasso's painting 'never constitutes a unified whole' and was thus unsuccessful. "After months of the most laborious searching, notes Kahnweiler, "Picasso realized that the complete solution of the problem did not lie in this direction".&lt;ref name="Cottington" /&gt; In July 1916, ''Les Demoiselles'' was exhibited to the public for the first time, and not in the gallery of Kahnweiler. It was included in the [[Salon d'Antin]], an exhibition organized by [[André Salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;Billy Klüver, ''A Day with Picasso'', The MIT Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-262-61147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bypassing the problem of color, simply by eliminating color from his paintings, Picasso in 1908 concentrated on form. Kahnweiler notes:

:"Thus Picasso painted figures resembling Congo sculptures, and still lifes of the simplest form. His perspective in these works is similar to that of Cézanne. Light is never more than a means to create form — through chiaroscuro, since he did not at this time repeat the unsuccessful attempt of 1907 to create form through drawing."&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;

"Derain, too, had abandoned decorative light painting in 1907", Kahnweiler writes, "preceding Braque by a few months. But from the outset, their roads were diverse. Derain's endeavor to retain fidelity to nature in his painting separates him forever from Cubism, no matter how closely his ideas may otherwise parallel those of Braque."&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler" /&gt;

[[File:Othon Friesz, 1907-08, Le Travail à l'Automne, oil on canvas, 200.5 x 250 cm, National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Othon Friesz]], 1907-08, ''Le Travail à l'Automne'', oil on canvas, 200.5 x 250 cm, [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design]], Oslo]]
And Derain was not the only one to venture along the path of Cézanne, only to turn away from it in the coming years. Chagall, Friesz, Matisse, Dufy, Redon, Vlaminck and Modigliani are prime examples.

But too, just as Picasso and Braque, other artists independently and simultaneously explored the Cézannian approach, and did continue on to become Cubists, each with his or her own particular style.

==The sequence of events==
The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was practically over by the spring of the 1907 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. And by the [[Salon d'Automne]] in the fall of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from expressing bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. Simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. For Metzinger and Delaunay, too, representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited. And Picasso had almost completed [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].

===1907===
* The 1907 Salon d'Automne impels Apollinaire to refer to Matisse as the "fauve of fauves". Works by both Derain and Matisse are criticized for the ugliness of their models. Braque and Le Fauconnier are considered as Fauves by the critic Michel Puy (brother of [[Jean Puy]]).&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt; Robert Delaunay showed one work, [[André Lhote]] showed three, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] three, [[Jean Crotti]] one, [[Fernand Léger]] five, [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] two, [[Raoul Dufy]] three, [[André Derain]] exhibited three paintings and [[Henri Matisse]] seven works.&lt;ref name="Salon 1907"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cataloguedesouvr00salo Salon d'automne; Société du Salon d'automne], Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art décoratif. Exposés au Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées, 1907&lt;/ref&gt;
* Metzinger and Delaunay are singled out by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

===1908===
[[File:Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Henri Le Fauconnier]], 1908, ''Ploumanac'h'', Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, the Netherlands]]
* At the Indépendants of 1908, a painting by Braque strikes Apollinaire by its originality. Though not listed in the catalog, it was described in ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt323.html Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants]&lt;/ref&gt; In his review published in ''La Revue des lettres et des arts'' (1 May 1908), Apollinaire claims that Braque's work is the most original presented at the salon. Even in the absence of Matisse and Picasso, Vauxcelles, in Gil Blas (20 March 1908) refers to the most innovative artists of the exposition as 'barbarous schematizers'...&amp;nbsp;who want to create an 'abstract art'.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;
* An exhibition at Galerie Notre-Dame-des-Champs (Paris) includes [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Jules Pascin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;MAM, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris 1937, L'Art Indépendant, ex. cat. {{ISBN|2-85346-044-4}}, Paris-Musées, 1987, P. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1908 continues with the ''Salon de la Toison d'Or'', Moscow: Braque, Derain, Metzinger, van Dongen, Friesz, Manguin, Marquet, Matisse, Puy, Valtat and others exhibit. At the 1909 Salon d’Automne, [[Constantin Brâncuși]] exhibits with [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]] and Jean Metzinger.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;

This exhibition was reviewed in the ''New York Herald'' 20 March 1908; by Vauxcelles in ''Gil Blas'' 20 March 1908; by C. Le Senne in ''Le Courrier du Soir'', 22 March 1908; and by [[Maurice Denis]], in ''La Grande revue'', 10 April 1908.&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;

* Six landscapes painted at L'Estaque signed Georges Braque were presented to the Jury of the [[Salon d'Automne]]: Guérin, Marquet, Rouault and Matisse rejected Braque's entire submission. Guérin and Marquet elected to keep two in play. Braque withdrew the two in protest, placing the blame on Matisse. [[Louis Vauxcelles]] recounts how Matisse told him at the time, "Braque has just sent in a painting made of little cubes".&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt;

[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1909, Autoportrait, Self-portrait, oil on canvas, 73 x 59.4 cm, 28 3-4 x 23.3-8, MNAM, Pompidou Paris.png|thumb|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1909, ''Autoportrait (Self portrait)'', oil on canvas, 73 × 59.4 cm (28 3/4 × 23 3/8 in), MNAM, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris]]
It is not known to which painting Matisse had referred, but it has been speculated to be ''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]'' (1908),&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt; a prototypical proto-Cubist period painting consisting both of Cézannian trees and houses depicted in the absence of any unifying perspective. Houses in the background do, however, appear smaller than those of the foreground, consistent with classical perspective.

* Following the rejection of Braque's paintings, Kahnweiler offers the artist a [[one-person show]] at his claustrophobic gallery on a small street situated behind [[La Madeleine, Paris]]. Apollinaire writes of the paintings exhibited nothing about cubes, but mentions "the synthetic motifs he paints" and that he "no longer owes anything to his surroundings". It was Vauxcelles who called Braque a daring man who despises form, "reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.&lt;ref name="Danchev" /&gt;

===1909===
According to John Golding's influential history of Cubism published in 1959, it was at the Salon des Indépendants of 1909, held 25 March through 2 May, that the first Cubist painting was exhibited to the public: ''Little Harbor in Normandy (Petit port en Normandie)'', no. 215, entitled ''Paysage'', by Georges Braque ([[Art Institute of Chicago]]). In Room 16 hung works by Derain, Dufy, Friesz, Laprade, Matisse, Jean Puy, Rouault and Vlaminck.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

* At the 1909 Automne, [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] exhibited a proto-[[Cubism|Cubist]] portrait of the French writer, novelist and poet [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Pierre Jean Jouve]], drawing the attention of [[Albert Gleizes]] who had been working in a similar geometric style.&lt;ref name="Kubisme Automne"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324.html Salon d'Automne, Kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt; Constantin Brâncuși exhibited alongside Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger]].&lt;ref name="Russell T. Clement" /&gt;
* The evolution towards a more rectilinear style with simplified forms continues with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles (derived from the works of Cézanne) not solely visible in the works of Braque, but too in the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay (Picasso being absent from the salons).&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

===1910===
[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1909-10, Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise), oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, Tate Modern, London.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1909-10, ''Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise)'', oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, [[Tate Modern]], London. This painting from the collection of [[Wilhelm Uhde]] was confiscated by the French state and sold at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in 1921]]
* At the 1910 Salon des Indépendants [[Albert Gleizes]] exhibits ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'', two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms to a large extent the representational interest of the painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt; The same tendency is evident in Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' (1909) exhibited in the same salon. According to Apollinaire this was the "first Cubist portrait (a portrait of myself)".&lt;ref name="Anecdotiques" /&gt; Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book ''The Cubist Painters'' (1913), Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.&lt;ref name="S.

Read, University of California Press, 1 October 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Metzinger, the same year, managed to convince the jury of the Salon d'Automne to admit some highly geometric paintings into the exhibition.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

According to Robert Delaunay himself, the ''Salle II'' of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants was "the first collective manifestation of a new art [un art naissant]".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-28'', Yale University Press, New Have and London, 1987 p. 314, note 51&lt;/ref&gt;

* At the Salon d'Automne of 1910, held from 1 October to 8 November, Jean Metzinger introduced an extreme form of what would soon be labeled Cubism, not just to the general public for the first time, but to other artists that had no contact with Picasso or Braque. Though others were already working in a proto-cubist vein with complex Cézannian geometries and unconventional perspectives, Metzinger's ''Nude'' represented a radical departure further still.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have in front of me a small cutting from an evening newspaper, ''The Press'', on the subject of the 1910 Salon d'Automne. It gives a good idea of the situation in which the new pictorial tendency, still barely perceptible, found itself: ''The geometrical fallacies of Messrs. Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, and Gleizes''. No sign of any compromise there. Braque and Picasso only showed in Kahnweiler's gallery and we were unaware of them. Robert Delaunay, Metzinger and Le Fauconnier had been noticed at the Salon des Indépendants of that same year, 1910, without a label being fixed on them. Consequently, although much effort has been put into proving the opposite, the word ''Cubism'' was not at that time current. (Albert Gleizes, 1925)&lt;ref name="Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', translation by Peter Brooke. Originally written by Gleizes in 1925 and published in a German version in 1928, under the title ''Kubismus'', in a series called ''Bauhausbücher'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review of the Salon, the poet [[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] (1885-1961) announces the appearance of a new school of French painters concentrating their attention on form rather than on color. A group forms that includes Gleizes, Metzinger, Delaunay (a friend and associate of Metzinger), and Fernand Léger. They meet regularly at Henri Le Fauconnier's studio near the Bld de Montparnasse, where he is working on his ambitious allegorical painting entitled ''L'Abondance''. "In this painting" writes Brooke, "the simplification of the representational form gives way to a new complexity in which foreground and background are united and the subject of the painting obscured by a network of interlocking geometrical elements".&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

This exhibition preceded the 1911 Salon des Indépendants which officially introduced "Cubism" to the public as an organized group movement. Metzinger had been close to Picasso and Braque, working at this time along similar lines.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Metzinger, Henri Le Fauconnier and [[Fernand Léger]] exhibited coincidentally in Room VIII. This was the moment in which the Montparnasse group quickly grew to include [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Joseph Csaky]]. The three Duchamp brothers, [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], and another artist known as [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]] took part in the exhibition.

* Following this salon Metzinger writes the article ''Note sur la peinture'',&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture (Note on painting)'', Pan, Paris, October–November 1910, 649-51, reprinted in Edward Fry ''Cubism'', London, 1966. Quotation of the original French have been translated by Daniel Robbins&lt;/ref&gt; in which he compares the similarities in the works Picasso, Braque, Delaunay, Gleizes and Le Fauconnier. In doing so he enunciated for the first time, not the term "Cubism", but what would become known as the characteristics of [[Cubism]]: notably the notions of [[simultaneity]] and mobile perspective. In this seminal text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, he wrote, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Once launched at the 1910 Salon d'Automne, the burgeoning movement would rapidly spread throughout Paris.

* After the 1910 Salon d'Automne, the writer [[Gelett Burgess]] begins a series of interviews with the avant-garde working currently in Paris and surrounding [[banlieue]]s. These interviews and Burgess' impressions of the works produced are published in ''Architectural Record, May 1910.&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess" /&gt;
* According to Gleizes' memoirs, Mercereau introduces him to Metzinger but only after the Salon d'Automne do they become seriously interested in each other's work.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;
* Louis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The work of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified ''Ploumanac'h'' landscapes: ''Le Ravin'' and ''Village dans les Montagne'', along with ''Femme à l'éventail'' and ''Portrait of Maroussia''. In the same hall hung the works of Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Laurencin, van Dongen and [[Henri Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

==Cubism==
{{Main article|Cubism}}
"The question of when Cubism began and who led the way in its development", writes art historian Christopher Green, "is inextricably tied up with the question of what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist".&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt; Picasso's landscapes painted at ''Horta de Hebro'' in 1909 (executed two years after ''Les Demoiselles'' and one year after the "cubes" of Braque's L'Estaque paintings) were considered the first Cubist painting by Gertrude Stein. It is generally recognized, however, that the first Cubist exhibition transpired in 1911. Jean Metzinger, judging from the Burgess interview, appears to have abandoned his [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style in favor of the ''faceting of form'' associated with analytic Cubism around 1908 or early 1909.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; Metzinger frequented the [[Bateau Lavoir]] at this time and exhibited with Braque at the [[Berthe Weill]] gallery. By 1910, the robust form of early analytic Cubism of Picasso (''Girl with a Mandolin, Fanny Tellier'', 1910), Braque (''Violin and Candlestick'', 1910) and Metzinger (''[[Nu à la cheminée|Nu à la cheminée (Nude)]]'', 1910) had become practically indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;

In his article entitled ''Note sur la peinture'',&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; published the same year, Metzinger acknowledges the birth of a new kind of painting; one that employed a mobile perspective. In that seminal text, Metzinger identifies similarities in the works of [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], on the one hand, [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] on the other. Of this group of five, only Metzinger and Braque were familiar with the works of Picasso, and Metzinger alone, familiar with the works of everyone in the group. It is now universally believed that Metzinger was the first to recognize explicitly and implicitly the significance of the use of "a free, mobile perspective", and the "mixing... of the successive and the simultaneous".&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; He was the first to write of the fact that artists had abandoned traditional perspective and were now free to move around their subjects to paint them from various points in space, and at various moments in time.&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1910" /&gt; Metzinger's role at center of Cubism both as a painter and theorist prompted Guillaume Apollinaire to write of Picasso, Braque and Metzinger as the first three Cubist painters.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

Now well beyond the teachings of Cézanne, the newly formed Montparnasse group (who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]], [[:fr:La Coupole (brasserie)|La Coupole]], [[:fr:La Closerie des Lilas|La Closerie des Lilas]], Le Select'', and ''[[Café de la Rotonde]]'') together with other young painters who also want to emphasize a research into form (as opposed to color) take over the hanging committee of the [[Salon des Indépendants]] ensuring that the works of a small group of artists would be shown together: Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and [[Marie Laurencin]] (at the request of Apollinaire) are shown in Room 41.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

===1911 Salon des Indépendants===
{{main article|Salon des Indépendants}}
The first group exhibition of Cubism transpired at the 1911 Indépendants.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt; The result of the group show is a major scandal. Both the public and the press are outraged by the obscurity of the subject matter, represented as cones, cubes and spheres. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although similar terms (i.e., "cubes") have been used before in relation to the works of Cross (1901), Metzinger and Delaunay (1906, 1907) and Braque (1908), the term "Cubism" emerges for the first time at the inauguration of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants; imposed by 'scandal-mongering journalists who wished to create sensational news' (to use the words of Gleizes). The term was used derogatorily to describe the diverse geometric concerns reflected in the paintings of five artists in continual communication with one another: Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger (but not Picasso or Braque, both absent from this massive exhibition).&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes ''Souvenirs, le cubisme 1908-14'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes 1 (Lyon, 1957), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guillaume Apollinaire]], deeming it necessary to deflect the endless attacks throughout the press, accepts the term ''"Cubism"'' (the "ism" signifying a tendency of behavior, action or opinion belonging to a class or group of persons (an [[art movement]]); the result of an [[ideology]] or [[principle]]).&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

The term "Cubisme" is employed for the first time outside France in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking in the context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Archipenko, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, Segonzac, Le Fauconnier and Jean Marchand. But Jean Metzinger, who had been termed "the Emperor of Cubism" during the spring in Paris, was not among the artist exhibiting works in Brussels.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; Apollinaire’s impulse was to define ''L'Esprit nouveau'' observed in a range of paintings, from proto-Cubist quasi-Fauve landscapes to the semi-abstract geometric compositions of artists such as Metzinger, Delaunay, Gleizes and a growing group of followers. In his chapter on Picasso, however, there is no mention of the term Cubism.&lt;ref name="Apollinaire" /&gt;

Before the Indépendance, the Cubists infiltrated the placement committee to make sure they would all be shown as a group. Le Fauconnier, the secretary of the salon, facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works had been placed according to alphabetical order of the artists names. In Room 41 hung works by Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by [[André Lhote]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]], Luc-Albert Moreau and [[André Mare]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of [[Henri Rousseau|Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau]], who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in ''Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre'', and ''Cri de Paris''. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of ''L'Intransigeant''.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

Henri Le Fauconnier's ''Abundance'', 1910-11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter, was an eye-catcher, causing a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society ([[:es:Moderne Kunstkring|Moderne Kunstkring]]). In 1934 he donated the painting to the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt;

===1911 Salon d'Automne===
{{main article|Salon d'Automne}}
Another Cubist scandal is produced at the Salon d'Automne of 1911. The Indépendants exhibitors develop relations with the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed ''Groupe de Puteaux'' (soon to exhibit under the name [[Section d'Or]]). [[František Kupka]], the Czech painter interested in [[Abstract art|non-representational]] painting based on analogies with music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion, joins the discussions.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;

In Room 7 and 8 of the 1911 Salon d'Automne, held at the Grand Palais in Paris, hung works by Metzinger (''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]''), [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Lhote]], [[Jacques Villon]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[František Kupka]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Francis Picabia]]. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the second time. The first was the organized group showing by Cubists in ''Salle 41'' of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]]. In room 41 hung the work of Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. Articles in the press could be found in [[Gil Blas]], Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre, Cri de Paris. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the April 20, 1911 issue of L'Intransigeant.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; Thus Cubism spread into the literary world of writers, poets, critics, and art historians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v2r0HrOZmCMC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=%22the+press%22+1910,+salon+d'automne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AP0FMfXgwJ&amp;sig=nLRXYZg3us2vxH7LXlnxJvI_QuY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20press%22%201910%2C%20salon%20d'automne&amp;f=false Douglas Cooper, ''The Cubist Epoch'', Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, N.Y., Phaidon Press, 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollinaire took Picasso to the opening of the Salon d'Automne in 1911 to see the cubist works in Room 7 and 8.&lt;ref name="Kubisme Automne" /&gt;

Albert Gleizes writes of the Salon d'Automne of 1911: "With the Salon d'Automne of that same year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent as it had been at the Indépendants." He writes: "The painters were the first to be surprised by the storms they had let loose without intending to, merely because they had hung on the wooden bars that run along the walls of the Cours-la-Reine, certain paintings that had been made with great care, with passionate conviction, but also in a state of great anxiety."&lt;ref name="Gleizes" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was from that moment on that the word ''Cubism'' began to be widely used. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Never had the critics been so violent as they were at that time. From which it became clear that these paintings - and I specify the names of the painters who were, alone, the reluctant causes of all this frenzy: Jean Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and myself - appeared as a threat to an order that everyone thought had been established forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In nearly all the papers, all composure was lost. The critics would begin by saying: ''there is no need to devote much space to the Cubists, who are utterly without importance'' and then they furiously gave them seven columns out of the ten that were taken up, at that time, by the Salon. (Gleizes, 1925)&lt;ref name="Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewing the Salon d'Automne of 1911, Huntly Carter in ''The New Age'' writes that "art is not an accessory to life; it is life itself carried to the greatest heights of personal expression." Carter continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at the Salon d'Automne, amid the Rhythmists [Cubists], I found the desired sensation. The exuberant eagerness and vitality of their region, consisting of two room remotely situated, was a complete contrast to the morgue I was compelled to pass through in order to reach it. Though marked by extremes, it was clearly the starting point of a new movement in painting, perhaps the most remarkable in modern times, It revealed not only that artists are beginning to recognise the unity of art and life, but that some of them have discovered life is based on rhythmic vitality, and underlying all things is the perfect rhythm that continues and unites them. Consciously, or unconsciously, many are seeking for the perfect rhyth, and in so doing are attaining a liberty or wideness of expression unattained through several centuries of painting. (Huntly Carter, 1911)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/mjp/render.php?view=mjp_object&amp;id=1165303701968750 Huntley Carter, ''Letters from Abroad, The Post-Expressionists'', The New Age, a weekly review of Politics, Literature, and Art, New series, Vol. 9. No. 26, London: The New Age Press, Ltd., Thursday October 26, 1911. p. 617]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes and Metzinger render homage to Cézanne in their 1912 Cubist manifesto ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'':

:"To understand Cézanne is to foresee Cubism. Henceforth we are justified in saying that between this school and previous manifestations there is only a difference of intensity, and that in order to assure ourselves of this we have only to study the methods of this realism, which, departing from the superficial reality of Courbet, plunges with Cézanne into profound reality, growing luminous as it forces the unknowable to retreat. (Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, 1912)&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">'''Sturgeon's revelation''' (as originally expounded by [[Theodore Sturgeon]]), commonly referred to as '''Sturgeon's law''', is an [[adage]] commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap". It is derived from quotations by Sturgeon, an American [[science fiction author]] and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law", it is the "ninety percent crap" remark that is usually referred to by that term.

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of [[artistic work|works]] in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

== History ==
A similar adage appears in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Light that Failed]]'', published in 1890. "Four-fifths of everybody's work must be bad. But the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Writings in Prose and Verse of Rudyard Kipling|author=Rudyard, K.|isbn=9785874724696|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kRELAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written reference to the adage appears in the March 1958 issue of ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]'', where Sturgeon wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud. Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. is crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.&lt;ref name="venture" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Philip Klass ([[William Tenn]]), Sturgeon made this remark circa 1951, at a talk at [[New York University]] attended by Tenn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/328 |title=&amp;#39;SF Citations for OED&amp;#39; |publisher=Jessesword.com |date=6 July 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310213832/http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/328 |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was subsequently included in a talk Sturgeon gave at a 1953 [[Labor Day]] weekend  session of the [[World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/misc/slaw.html|title=James Gunn, 'Addendum: Sturgeon's Law' |publisher=Physics.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] championed Sturgeon's law as one of his seven tools for critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/05/philosopher_daniel_dennett_presents_seven_tools_for_critical_thinking.html |title=Daniel Dennett Presents Seven Tools For Critical Thinking&amp;#39; |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "90% of everything is crap.  That is true, whether you are talking about physics, chemistry, evolutionary psychology, sociology, medicine—you name it—rock music, country western.  90% of everything is crap."  Its re-introduction to a modern audience received a positive reception, according to Dennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/daniel_dennett_tools_for_thinking/ |title=Point of Inquiry | quote=Audio segment starting at minute 39|date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original Sturgeon's law ==
Sturgeon had originally deemed Sturgeon's law to mean that "nothing is always absolutely so" in the story "The Claustrophile" in a 1956 issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Claustrophile", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' August 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The second adage, variously rendered as "ninety percent of everything is crud" or "ninety percent of everything is crap", was originally known as "Sturgeon's Revelation", formulated as such in his book review column for ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]''&lt;ref name="venture"&gt;''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]'' 49, September 1957&lt;/ref&gt; in 1957. However, almost all modern uses of the term Sturgeon's law actually refer to the second, including the definition listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

'''''The Brahmin and the Mongoose''''' (or '''''The Brahmin's Wife and the Mongoose''''') is a folktale from [[India]], and "one of the world's most travelled tales".&lt;ref name=b494&gt;Blackburn, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the rash killing of a loyal animal, and thus warns against hasty action. The story underlies certain legends in the West, such as that of Llywelyn and his dog [[Gelert]] in Wales,&lt;ref name=b494/&gt; or that of [[Saint Guinefort]] in France.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=b496/&gt; It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 178A.&lt;ref&gt;D.

The original version from the [[Panchatantra]] in [[Sanskrit]] goes as follows (translation from {{Harvnb|Ryder|1925}}):
{{quote|
The Loyal Mongoose{{efn|The source uses the spelling "mungoose" throughout; the spelling has been here modernized to "mongoose" for consistency with the rest of the article.}}

There was once a Brahman named Godly [orig. ''Devasharma''] in a certain town. His wife mothered a single son and a mongoose. And as she loved little ones, she cared for the mongoose also like a son, giving him milk from her breast, and salves, and baths, and so on. But she did not trust him, for she thought: “A mongoose is a nasty kind of creature. He might hurt my boy.” [...]

One day she tucked her son in bed, took a waterjar, and said to her husband: “Now, Professor, I am going for water. You must protect the boy from the mongoose.” But when she was gone, the Brahman went off somewhere himself to beg food, leaving the house empty.

While he was gone, a black snake issued from his hole and, as fate would have it, crawled toward the baby’s cradle. But the mongoose, feeling him to be a natural enemy, and fearing for the life of his baby brother, fell upon the vicious serpent halfway, joined battle with him, tore him to bits, and tossed the pieces far and wide. Then, delighted with his own heroism, he ran, blood trickling from his mouth, to meet the mother; for he wished to show what he had done.

But when the mother saw him coming, saw his bloody mouth and his excitement, she feared that the villain must have eaten her baby boy, and without thinking twice, she angrily dropped the water-jar upon him, which killed him the moment that it struck. There she left him without a second thought, and hurried home, where she found the baby safe and sound, and near the cradle a great black snake, torn to bits. Then, overwhelmed with sorrow because she had thoughtlessly killed her benefactor, her son, she beat her head and breast.

At this moment the Brahman came home with a dish of rice gruel which he had got from someone in his begging tour, and saw his wife bitterly lamenting her son, the mongoose. “Greedy! Greedy!” she cried. “Because you did not do as I told you, you must now taste the bitterness of a son’s death, the fruit of the tree of your own wickedness. Yes, this is what happens to those blinded by greed....”

In Western variants of the story, other animals take the place of the mongoose, most often a dog. It is also found in other versions as a [[weasel]], cat (in Persia), bear, or lion, and the snake is sometimes replaced with a wolf (in Wales). The essence of the story, however, remains the same. Similarly, variants of the story sometimes have the man, instead of his wife, killing the loyal animal.&lt;ref name=b498&gt;Blackburn, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is sometimes placed within a frame story, where a saviour stands mistakenly accused and narrates this story, thereby preventing his own death.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Blackburn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and travel==
The story was first studied in 1859 by [[Theodor Benfey]], the pioneer of comparative literature, when he compared the versions in India, the Middle East and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Benfey, Theodor S. 1859. Pantschatantra.2 vols. Leipzig: F. W. Brockhaus; Benfey, Theodor S. 1862. 'Ueber die alte deutsche Uebersetzung des Kalilah und Dimnah', Orient und Occident, 1: 138-187.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1884, W. A. Clouston showed how it had reached Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Clouston, W. A. 1884. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UnEAAAAAMAAJ The Book of Sindibad]. Glasgow: privately printed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gelert.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Gelert]]'' by [[Charles Burton Barber]] (1845–1894)]] 
[[Murray B. Emeneau]] considers the migration of this story, through its steps from India to Wales, as "one of the best authenticated cases of such diffusions of folk-tales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =  10.2307/985117| jstor = 985117 | pages = 503–513 | title = A Classical Indian Folk-Tale as a Reported Modern Event: the Brahman and the Mongoose | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | publisher = American Philosophical Society | year = 1940| author1 = Emeneau | first1 = M. B.}}, p.507&lt;/ref&gt;  It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 178A.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0178a.html Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert and other folktales of Aarne-Thompson type 178A]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The story occurs in all versions of the [[Panchatantra]], as well as the later Sanskrit works [[Hitopadesha]]&lt;ref name=hitopadesha&gt;
{{citation | year=2007 | title = "Friendly advice" by Nārāyaṇa and "King Vikrama's adventures" | author1=Nārāyaṇa | author2=Judit Törzsök (transl.) | publisher=NYU Press and [[Clay Sanskrit Library]] | isbn=978-0-8147-8305-4 | pages=513–515 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdV9dMQci9sC&amp;pg=PA513}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kathasaritsagara]].
It also occurs in most of the languages of India (and South Asia) where it is extremely familiar.
For instance, in the [[South India]]n state of [[Karnataka]], the story occurs as a proverb in inscriptions,&lt;ref name=b496&gt;Blackburn, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; as a sculpture in a temple,&lt;ref&gt;
Mallikarjuna Temple at [[Pattadakal]], Karnataka, eighth century. See:
* C. S. Patil (1995), ''Panchatantra in Karnataka sculptures'', Mysore: Directorate of Archaeology and Museums.
&lt;/ref&gt; in narratives of travelling storytellers and singers,&lt;ref&gt;

* Kyathanahalli Rāmaṇṇa (1972), ''Gondalingara Kathegalu''. Mysore: Institute for Kannada Studies.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0MHirNAR9o Nodiddu sullagabahudu (video)] ("Things are not always what they seem"), from ''Rama Lakshmana'' (1980). Note that here, too, the story is framed within another story of an unjustly accused animal (a pet tiger).&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] epic ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' recalls the story simply by its name.

Like the rest of the Panchatantra, in its westward migration it travelled from Sanskrit to Arabic (as ''Kalila wa Dimna''), Persian, [[Hebrew]], Greek, Latin, Old French, and eventually into all the major languages of Europe (as ''The Fables of Pilpay'' or ''Bidpai''), ranging from Russian to [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] to English. 
In its eastward migration, it appears in Chinese (ten versions, including in a redaction of the Vinaya Pitaka), and over a wide region from Mongolia to Malaysia.
It is also the only story found in all recensions of the Panchatantra, all versions of the 'Book of Sindibad' (not [[Sindbad]]),
and all versions of '[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Sages of Rome]]'.&lt;ref name=b495&gt;Blackburn, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also found in Mexico and the United States. Blackburn observes that the fable is not a dead tradition and is still current, as a Belgian newspaper reported it as an anecdote about a man who left his son and dog in a shopping trolley in his car.&lt;ref name=b495/&gt;

The motif also occurs, with a happy ending, in the Disney film ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955).&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;

==Reception/influence==
The story is often used in culture as an [[exemplum]] cautioning against hasty action. In addition, it also serves as shorthand for sin, regret and grief.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

In Welsh it became the story of the nobleman Llywelyn who kills his loyal dog, [[Gelert]]. It was later interpreted as a legend about a true event, and small shrines to the dog exist in Wales (such as in the village of [[Beddgelert]], "Gelert's grave"). In France a similar metamorphosis took larger proportions, and the story became the cult of [[Saint Guinefort]] (a dog), which was popular until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{citation | author=Stephen Belcher | contribution=Panchatantra | title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales | editor=Donald Haase | year=2008 | volume=2 | pages=723–725 | isbn=978-0-313-33441-2 | quote=…is a saint's legend behind a pilgrimage site in France.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p. 496. {{quote|When the dog replaced the mongoose, the tale was commonly interpreted as a legend (that is as a true event), and the loyal animal's undeserving death was commemorated by small shrines to the dog not only in Wales but also in north India […] On a larger scale, this tale inspired the cult of St. Guinefort in France…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackburn points out that although in the many literary versions it is the man who kills the mongoose, in most ''oral'' versions (and even the literary version quoted above), it is the woman who does so. Further, ''both'' literary and oral versions place the woman at the centre of the story, emphasizing her maternal feelings toward the animal, her mixture of love and fear, and her grief at its death. Thus he asserts that "the tale is a drama enacted between a mother and her son" and proposes some interpretations.&lt;ref name=b501&gt;Blackburn, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of '''tobacco smoking in art''' date back at least to the pre-Columbian [[Maya civilization]], where smoking had religious significance. The motif occurred frequently in painting of the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]], in which people of lower social class were often shown smoking [[pipe smoking|pipes]]. In European art of the 18th and 19th centuries, the social location of people – largely men – shown as smoking tended to vary, but the stigma attached to women who adopted the habit was reflected in some artworks. Art of the 20th century often used the [[cigar]] as a [[status symbol]], and parodied images from [[tobacco advertising]], especially of women. Developing health concerns around tobacco smoking also influenced its artistic representation. Recently tobacco has impacted on art in a quite different way, with the conversion of many [[Cigarette machine|cigarette vending machines]] into [[Art-o-mat]] outlets, selling miniature artworks the shape and size of a [[cigarette]] packet.

==Maya art==
[[File:Smoking Monkey.jpg|thumb|alt=Maya vase.| Vase of the Smoking Monkey. A ceramic artifact from the Maya lowlands created in the late Classic period. A spider monkey possibly representing a deity smokes a cigarette.]]

[[Maya civilization|Mayas]] were perhaps the first people to represent tobacco smoking in art. Mayas smoked heavily, and they believed that their gods did too.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Tobacco and Religion." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 27-36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious ritual]]s often involved [[tobacco]]: offerings were given to certain gods and tobacco smoke warded off evil deities.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Many tribes viewed tobacco as a supernatural, magical substance (perhaps because of its strong physiological and sometimes [[hallucinogen]]ic effects).&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Because of tobacco's significance, it is not surprising that Mayas produced artistic representations of smoking.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; The artwork mostly portrays religious rituals and myths involving [[god]]s or [[lord]]s because ordinary people and actions were considered too unimportant and unworthy for time consuming art pieces.&lt;ref name= b&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "The Classification of Archaeological Material." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 111-13. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous depictions of smoking can be found from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic epoch]] (3rd through 8th centuries). Though what substance deities and people are smoking cannot be said for certain, scholars generally conclude that the smoked substance is tobacco after studying archaeological materials.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; The representations are occasionally confusing as the Mayas portrayed [[smoke]] and [[cigar]]s in varied ways.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; Smoke can be illustrated with black dots, black and red dots (with red indicating sparks), converging scrolls, or converging coils.&lt;ref name= b/&gt;&lt;ref name= a&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Scenes Almost Certainly Representing the Act of Smoking." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 114-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Converging scrolls also sometimes represent [[foliage]], speech, fire, smells, and other things.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; Cigars are usually funnel-shaped (or torch-shaped) and vary greatly in size.&lt;ref name= b/&gt; [[Cigarette]]s (small, slender cigars in this case) resemble modern cigarettes (narrow, long rectangles) or elongated ovals.&lt;ref name= b/&gt;

===Codices===
Mayas created [[Codex|codices]] chronicling their history and culture, and they constructed pages from ''copo'' - plant fiber on bark or deerskin with lime.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; Though [[Missionary|missionaries]] destroyed many codices, one of the remaining codices (the Codex Madrid ) contains depictions of smoking.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; Gods smoke cigars on pages 79b, 86b, 87, and 88.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; The Codex Madrid also contains [[glyph]]s thought to mean “smoking.” &lt;ref&gt;Robicsek, Francis. "Tobacco and the Mayas." The Smoking Gods: Tobacco in Maya Art, History, and Religion. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1978. 11-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stone monuments and frescos===
The Sanctuary of the [[Temple of the Cross]] at [[Palenque]] (a Maya city in current [[Mexico]]) houses a monument called “El Fumador” (Spanish for “The Smoker”). The stone door panel features an elderly deity blowing smoke from a large cigar. Because of the cigar's funnel shape (which compares to cigars currently used by rural [[South America]]n tribes) and the outward flaring smoke, scholars believe the monument depicts a religious ritual similar to those performed by other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; No other stone monuments depicting smoking are known, but there may have been others.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

The only known Maya painting to depict smoking is found at [[Tulum]] (a Maya city on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in current Mexico). The Temple of the Diving God houses the [[fresco]], and the painting features monsters (perhaps birds) smoking large cigars.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

===Ceramics and other artwork===
Mayans also portrayed smoking on [[ceramic]] objects including boxes, plates, vases, and bowls.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; The ceramics were carved or painted multiple colors (typically black, white, and red). Important ceramics featuring smoking include the Vase of the Dancing Lord, the Reynolds vase (at the [[Museum of the American Indian]]), Plate of the Smoking God, the Woman, and the Monkey (at the National Museum of Guatemala), Vase of the Smoking Monkey, and Bowl of the Eleven Deities, Five of Them Smoking.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

The Vase of the Danse Macâbre depicts a smoking [[skeleton]] carrying a jar or pouch and another skeleton and two [[jaguar]]s also holding pouches or jars. The carried objects are believed to hold tobacco or tobacco mixed with other substances.&lt;ref name= a/&gt; They display the sign of darkness, so tobacco may have been associated with rituals relating to death.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

Though the majority of depictions show gods and lords, some artifacts portray the everyday. For example, the Plate of the Smoking Husband depicts a man smoking a cigarette and his wife rolling dough inside their home.&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

Other artifacts depicting smoking have also been found including a shell carving, which is now housed at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name= a/&gt;

==Dutch art during the Golden Age==
[[File:Smell.jpg|thumb|alt=Smell.|''Smell'' (1637) by Jan Miense Molenaar. This oil painting exemplifies tobacco's usage in comedic Dutch works.]]

The ordinary person in the 17th century [[Dutch Republic]] viewed tobacco as a novelty and associated smoking with [[social deviance]]. A divide existed between the medicinal use of tobacco, which was widely accepted, and recreational use, which was seen as low class and inappropriate for more respected citizens including church and government leaders.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Johann Neander's ''Tabacologia'', written in 1622, demonstrates the prevalent belief that tobacco held curative and preventative properties for a wide range of diseases.&lt;ref name= ivan&gt;Gaskell, Ivan. "Tobacco, Social Deviance, and Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century." Looking at Seventeenth-Century Dutch Art: Realism Reconsidered. Ed. Wayne E. Franits. New York: Cambridge UP, 1997. 68-77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, smoking's prevalence among [[sailor]]s, [[soldier]]s, and the [[Rural poverty|rural poor]] along with its [[Substance intoxication|intoxicating]] effects led to an association with the lowliest people.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Thus, smoking became a tool for artists to designate someone's rank in society, and painters including [[Adriaen Brouwer]], the Ostade brothers, and [[David Teniers II]] employed smoking in their portrayals of the low classes. Smoking also became a comedic prop for painters especially in festival and burlesque paintings.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; [[Ivan Gaskell]] (Curator of Paintings, Sculpture, and Decorative Arts in the [[Harvard Art Museums]]) argues that "If we trace the imagery of topsy-turvydom in Dutch art we find tobacco to be a key element in scenes of comic disorder".&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

[[Jan Steen]], perhaps the most famous comic painter during the 17th century, often included [[pipe smoking]], which took on sexual connotations in his paintings of [[brothel]]s and [[tavern]]s. For example, a man packing tobacco into a pipe along with pipes leaning against [[chamberpot]]s symbolized sexual [[flirtation]]s and [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]].&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; These were often used for a comic effect, especially in illustrations of robbers stealing from intoxicated patrons of brothels and taverns.

Moreover, women smoking in Steen's paintings subverted [[cultural norms]] and added an additional comic effect as men almost exclusively smoked during that time period. Short pipes, especially, implied the most debased women and the ugliest [[prostitute]]s.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Moreover, pipes, especially a pair of crossed pipes, symbolized rhetoricians—guilds of actors and poets that held festivals emphasizing pleasure.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; Several of Steen's paintings were created to illustrate [[proverb]]s including: "as the old sing, so the young pipe (soo de ouden songen, soo pijpen de jongen)" &lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;—meaning the youth will pick up poor habits like smoking by imitating adults. Finally, Steen often included negative implications of smoking even when he painted smoking for a comic effect by depicting smokers next to a [[beggar]]’s crutches or whipping branches to reiterate to the viewer that smoking will lead to “punishment, poverty, and beggary".&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

Because of economic interests in importing tobacco from the [[New World]] to [[Europe]] and even starting domestic tobacco farming, [[Amsterdam]] merchants worked to reduce smoking stigmatization.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt; By the late 17th century, smoking long-stemmed and polished pipes became acceptable for more respectable males while the lower classes smoked from cruder and shorter pipes. [[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] also gained popularity, and depictions of smoking and tobacco in paintings and drawings became more representative of the mundane and everyday than comically absurd situations and social outcasts.&lt;ref name= ivan/&gt;

==18th century to 21st century==
[[File:Munch SelfBurningCigarette.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Munch Self-Portrait.|Edvard Munch ''Self-Portrait with Burning Cigarette'']]

Following the [[Golden Age]], tobacco usage in artwork lost prominence. The decline of smoking representations is most likely due to the influence of [[Rococo]] age elegance, which made snuff the preferred choice.&lt;ref name= tempel&gt;Tempel, Benno. "Symbol and File: Smoking in Art since the Seventeenth Century." ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mM5bYb_uVcwC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=Tempel,+Benno.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vx9OUeenEMHs0QGcqoGQAg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tempel%2C%20Benno.&amp;f=false Smoke: a Global History of Smoking]''. Ed. Sander L. Gilman and Xun Zhou. London: Reaktion, 2004. 206-217. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Though snuff usage increased, snuff portrayals never became as common as those of cigars, cigarettes, and pipes in European paintings. Against norms of the time period, French artist [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], who was inspired by Golden Age artwork, occasionally included pipes in his pieces.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; One such painting is a [[still life]] entitled ''Smoking Kit with Drinking Pot.'' The pipe in this piece lacks symbolic meaning.

In the late 18th century and early 19th century, smoking took on new and varied symbolic meanings. During this time period, men were the primary smokers, and smoking was not an acceptable habit for women who were expected to be ideal mothers or mistresses.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; In the [[Romantic period]], people believed smoking held a close association with [[intellectualism]]. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Stéphane Mallarmé]]'' exemplifies art from this time. The painting shows an upper class man with a lit cigar in his hand and that same hand resting on top of an open book. His eyes are look into the distance seeming to be deep in thought. Benno Tempel (curator of the [[Kunsthal]], [[Rotterdam]]) argues that smoking in this painting symbolizes a modern lifestyle even though smoking had been around for centuries.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé (Manet).jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé.| Édouard Manet's ''Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé'']]

The [[Impressionism|impressionists]] painted scenes of everyday life that included cigars, cigarettes, or pipes, but they did not put symbolic importance in them.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; The [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionists]] returned symbolic meaning to smoking instruments. One notable painting was done by [[Vincent van Gogh]] called ''Skull with a Burning Cigarette''. Although this painting seems to be an anti-smoking warning, it was actually representative of the [[black humor]] and [[practical joke]]s popular during that time.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Edvard Munch]] launched this trend with his painting ''Self-Portrait''. It shows the artist with a cigarette against a dark background and an eerie look across his face. Munch used smoke to symbolize psychological problems.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

By the 20th century, cigarettes, cigars, and pipes all had their own specific meanings and connotations that developed across history. By playing off these meanings, artists conveyed a fuller understanding of an artwork to the viewer. For example, the cigar came to represent a social [[status symbol]], and artists included cigars in paintings to show emphasize social classes and power differences. [[Heinrich Maria Davringhausen]]’s ''The Black Marketeer'' depicts a boss with a boxful of cigars and a lit one at the edge of his desk. This demonstrates the unequal social relationship between the employer and the employee.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Pablo Picasso]] also used the pipe in his piece called ''The Poet''. This painting relies on the inseparable connection between literature and the pipe to provide the viewer with a better understanding of the painting.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

===Pop art===
With the rise of [[Pop art|Pop Art]], art pieces became more cynical. Pop art culture targeted clichés that evolved from the [[tobacco industry]]. [[Mel Ramos]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]] are two notable artists who poked fun at the industry.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Following the stigmatization of tobacco in America, pop art has shed a negative light on smoking. [[Claes Oldenburg]]’s sculpture ''Giant Fagends'' depicts how [[Tobacco addiction|cigarette addiction]] exemplifies the American's wasteful [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; [[Duane Hanson]]’s ''Supermarket Shopper'' shows a miserable middle-aged woman to represent how present day Americans view smokers: ruled by the addiction and lack will-power.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

===Modern art===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jac Leiner’s Lung.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Jac Leiner’s Lung.| Jac Leiner's "Lung". Made from hundreds of Marlboro packs. Located at MoMA in NYC &lt;ref&gt;Leirner, Jac. Lung. 1987. Marlboro cigarette packages strung on a polyurethane cord. Museum of Modern Art, New York City, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

Various forms of [[modern art]] have also included cigarettes. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]] displayed Jac Leiner's ''Lung'' in March 2009. This piece features 1200 [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] packs neatly folded and strung together. Leiner illustrates her own personal addiction by presenting the sickening amount of cigarettes that she unconsciously consumed over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Guy. "Jac Leirner's Lung."

This piece portrays an incompletely painted man on a large canvas with the title of the painting written across the top. It demonstrates the addictive power of cigarettes because the artist cannot overcome the addiction to finish something that he presumably loves to do: paint.&lt;ref name= polke&gt;Polke, Sigmar.

==Smoking, women, and art==
During the 17th century, Dutch paintings with women and pipes symbolized misfortune. Women in these paintings are rarely the ones in possession of the pipe, and the Dutch artists meant to send a moral message that foolish behaviors like smoking will lead people into [[wikt:hardship|hardship]]s.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

Artwork in the 18th century included pipes to convey an [[exoticism]] and [[eroticism]] even though depictions of smoking went out of fashion in the Western World.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; An example is [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]]’s ''A French Woman in Turkish Costume in a Harmam Instructing her Servant'', which features a woman with a long pipe standing in a position of authority.

In the 19th century, artists, [[Caricature|caricaturists]], fine [[Pottery|potters]], and even [[novelist]]s depicted women smoking. Though portrayals of women smokers became more common, they were shown in a negative light because smoking was still not acceptable for women.&lt;ref name= mitchell&gt;Mitchell, Dolores. "Women and Nineteenth- Century Images of Smoking." Smoke: a Global History of Smoking. Ed. Sander L. Gilman and Xun Zhou. London: Reaktion, 2004. 206-217. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, artwork that incorporated smoking was kept in rooms reserved only for men including smoking saloons, [[billiard room]]s, and libraries.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt; Impressionists employed pipes to distinguish males from females and emphasize their different [[social status]]es. In [[Georges Seurat]]’s ''A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte'', the male in the white suit holds a cigar, and even in this snapshot of everyday life, there is an implicit [[hierarchy]] between him and the woman who is with him.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt;

Prostitutes were the first women in this time period to be depicted with pipes, cigars, or cigarettes as seen in artwork from Vincent van Gogh and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. The women used smoke and make-up (as seen from their very white faces) to attract male clients.&lt;ref name=tempel/&gt; Some artists wanted to change social norms and de-stigmatize smoking for women. [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]] was one notable woman who studied illustrating for many years in [[Paris]] and then discovered [[photography]]. Her piece titled ''Self- Portrait'' depicts her holding a cigarette in one hand and a [[beer stein]] in the other. She is not dressed provocatively like most females who were associated with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and cigarettes during this time. Instead, she realistically captures aspects of her life and complicates the society's understanding of [[middle class]] women.&lt;ref name= mitchell/&gt; Jane Atché commercially published color [[lithograph]]s of women smokers without any sexual connotations. Her prints offered sophisticated woman who enjoyed cigarettes.&lt;ref name= mitchell/&gt;
[[File:Auguste Levêque -Suzanne02.jpg|thumb|Painting by Auguste Levêque. ''Portrait of Suzanne'']]

Resulting from new representations of women smokers from artists like Frances Benjamin Johnston and Jane Atché, smoking became more socially acceptable for women. Eventually, smoking grew into a phenomenon for women. Tobacco products took on varied meanings in the 20th century. During the [[Roaring Twenties]], women smoked cigarettes to appear chic and sophisticated.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Yet, paintings with female prostitutes holding with cigars took on a negative meaning because women from low classes were not meant to have objects connected with the upper class. These pieces showed women as seductresses who tricked men into giving them wealth and power.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

Smoking began losing its attractiveness as the 20th century progressed, and art followed this trend. Artists mocked the cigarette industry for using highly [[Sexualization|sexualized]] images of women in [[advertising]].&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Mel Ramos created artwork depicting naked women on cigars. Tom Wesselmann exploited the clichés of sex and cigarettes by painting an exposed breast behind an ashtray.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt; Present day artists acknowledge smoking as a health risk, but some want to fight modern, [[taboo]] perceptions of tobacco instead of demonizing smoking. [[Sarah Lucas]]’s photo titled "Fighting Fire with Fire" shows herself with a cigarette in the corner of her mouth. This one picture sums up the evolution of the relationship between woman, smoking, and art. According to Benno Tempel, this photo shows that “at times when society tries to create taboos, art can break through them”.&lt;ref name= tempel/&gt;

==Art-o-mat==
[[Art-o-mat]] machines sell pocket-size art pieces for $5.00 throughout the world. The apparatuses are converted [[Cigarette machine|cigarette vending machines]], which are now banned in the [[United States]]. Currently, 90 machines exist with one in [[Quebec]], one in [[Vienna]], and the rest throughout the United States. Private businesses, cultural centers, art museums, universities, and other locations possess Art-o-mats, and they receive $1.50 for each piece sold. Some renowned sites include New York City's [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Los Angeles]].

Over three hundred artists from ten different countries have created original artwork for the machines. $2.50 goes to the artist whenever someone buys their work. The pieces come in white containers the size of a cigarette pack (roughly two inches by three inches) and wrapped in [[cellophane]]. They range from miniature sculptures to jewelry to tiny paintings. Almost every media imaginable has been used including wood, glass, watercolors on canvas, clay, Styrofoam, magnets, stained-glass, and bronze.&lt;ref name= newsweek/&gt; Contributing sculptor Jules Vital said, “This project gives artists the opportunity to get their work into major venues, and it's cheap for buyers.".&lt;ref name= newsweek&gt;Rankine, Jerome. "Must Have: Pull Lever, Get Culture." Newsweek. Newsweek, Inc., 22 September 2003. Web. 28 April 2010. &lt;http://www.newsweek.com/id/60175&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clark Whittington]] built the first machine for his 1997 art show at a café in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. The original machine sold Whittington's black &amp; white photographs for $1.00, and Cynthia Giles, the owner of the café, requested that the machine remain after the show ended. Shortly afterward, Whittington formed Artists in Cellophane (A.I.C.) with other artists from the Winston-Salem area to build more art vending machines and to create pieces for them.

Today, A.I.C. sponsors the Art-o-mat machines with the goal of increasing art consumption by packaging art in an easily accessible manner. Whittington hopes collectors will form a habit of art buying and become interested in buying larger pieces from local artists.&lt;ref&gt;Cosgrove-Mather, Bootie. "Art-O-Mat Aims For Collectors." CBS News. CBS Interactive Inc., 25 February 2003. Web. 28 April 2010. &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/25/national/main541998.shtml&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; He collects the remaining $1.00 from each purchase to maintain the machines. A.I.C. seeks to unite art with consumerism and commerce and looks to expand to new locations and recruit new artists.&lt;ref&gt;"The Story behind Art-o-mat." Art-o-mat. Artists in Cellophane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48673">'''Unlimited''' is a commissioning programme that celebrates the work of deaf and disabled artists, originally conceived for by [[Arts Council England]] for the London [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/our-priorities-2011-15/london-2012/unlimited/|website=Arts Council England|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the programme represents a multi-million pound investment which to date has commissioned more than 70 pieces of work across theatre, dance, visual art, music, literature, film, poetry and performance art. Several Unlimited-commissioned pieces have gone on to have a global reach, such as [[Sue Austin]]'s ''Creating the Spectacle,'' which has reportedly been seen by more than 150 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.a-n.co.uk/news/digital-rd-fund-5-an-underwater-wheelchair-with-ambitions-to-fly|title=Digital R&amp;D Fund #5: An underwater wheelchair with ambitions to fly - a-n The Artists Information Company|work=a-n The Artists Information Company|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have won critical and industry acclaim within their field, such as Touretteshero's ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'', which earned the company the 2014 Total Theatre Award for Best Emerging Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edfringe.com/media/news/total-theatre-award-winners-announced|title=Total Theatre Award winners announced {{!}} Edinburgh Festival Fringe|work=Edinburgh Festival Fringe|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlimited is currently delivered in partnership between [[Shape Arts]] and [[Artsadmin]] with senior producer Jo Verrent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/jo-verrent/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2012 the programme was funded by the [[Olympic Lottery Distributor]], and was delivered in partnership between London 2012, Arts Council England, [[Creative Scotland]], [[Arts Council of Wales]], [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]] and [[British Council|the British Council]]. It was the first time the UK's four arts councils had collaborated with the British Council to commission new work. The British Council supported "five UK international collaborations with artists from seven countries which premiered in: Birmingham, Cambridge, Liverpool, Newcastle and Weymouth prior to a major showcase during the Paralympics"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Unlimited|url = https://www.britishcouncil.org/london-2012/culture-heart-games/unlimited|website = British Council|ref = British Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; London-based disability-led arts organisation, [[Shape Arts|Shape]] was contracted to support the 29 commissioned artists through the programme. This programme culminated at the inaugural Unlimited Festival at London's [[Southbank Centre]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unlimited|date=2012|publisher=London 2012 Festival|pages=89–94|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unlimited programme (2014–16) "offers commissions to disabled artists to develop, produce and show ambitious and high quality work, with mentoring support. The programme includes biennial festivals at [[Southbank Centre]] (2014 and 2016) and the opportunity for artists to showcase their work across the country through partnerships with venues and organisations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Unlimited|url=http://weareunlimited.org.uk/about-unlimited/|website=Unlimited|publisher=Shape and ArtsAdmin|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlimited is currently delivered in partnership by Shape and [[Artsadmin]], with funding from Arts Council England, Creative Scotland, Arts Council of Wales and Spirit of 2012. Key partners include British Council, [[DaDaFest]], Southbank Centre, and Tramway. Since 2012, [http://disabilityarts.online Disability Arts Online] has been the official media partner for the festival, tasked with documenting the work produced in the form of journalism.

Arts Council England have announced £1.8 million funding for a continuation of the Unlimited programme including festivals in 2018 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/apply-funding/apply-for-funding/unlimited/|title=Unlimited (III)|website=Arts Council England|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Woeful’ arts diversity progress prompts call for ‘more power and influence’|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/woeful-arts-diversity-progress-prompts-call-for-more-power-and-influence/|website=Disability News Service|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissions==

The primary purpose of the Unlimited programme is to commission new work by disabled artists and get it seen by as wide an audience as possible. Funding for commissions has so far come in three tranches. The first (Unlimited) which ran from 2010-2012, was a commissioning pot for work around the London 2012 Paralympics, with work being shown around the UK and at the first Unlimited Festival at [[Southbank Centre]]. The second (Unlimited II) covered the years 2013-2016 with work presented at various venues across the UK, culminating at the Unlimited Festivals in 2014 and 2016, again at Southbank Centre and for 2016, also at Glasgow's Tramway. The third (Unlimited III) will cover the period 2017-2020, which will include a greater focus on international collaborations and will encompass works which will be shown at Unlimited Festivals in 2018 and 2020.

Unlimited Festival 2012 was held at London's Southbank Centre from 30 August - 9 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlimited Festival Trailer|url=https://vimeo.com/48391700|website=Arts Council Vimeo Channel|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unlimited Festival attracted live audiences of 20,000 people at ticketed and free events and engaged with an estimated 11,000 people through digital media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 2013, when the Unlimited commissioning programme was taken on by Shape and Artsadmin, the relationship between the commissioning body and the festival changed; Southbank Centre would take responsibility for the festival, whilst Shape and Artsadmin would administer the commissioning programme. The festival would continue to act as a showcase event for the work commissioned by the programme, but other work by disabled artists would also feature alongside the Unlimited-commissioned work. The Southbank Centre hosted the second Unlimited Festival from 2–9 September 2014. Unlimited 2016 marked the first time that the festival went to a venue other than Southbank Centre. The festival took place at the Southbank Centre from 6–11 September, before Tramway in Glasgow hosted their own version of the festival from 15–25 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unlimited.southbankcentre.co.uk/|title=Home - Southbank Unlimited|last=Centre|first=Southbank|website=unlimited.southbankcentre.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/news/pages/tramway's-unlimited-festival-programme-announced.aspx|title=Tramway's Unlimited Festival programme announced|website=www.glasgowlife.org.uk|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arts Council England has committed funding for future festivals in 2018 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Unlimited Impact==

Unlimited Impact focuses on developing and inspiring the next generation of young disabled people passionate about making change through the arts; extending Unlimited’s reach by supporting venues across the country to successfully programme ambitious and high quality work by disabled artists; and deepening discussion and debate around work by disabled artists.

Unlimited Impact projects include:
* Your Slogan Here: a competition creating T-shirts with slogans by young disabled people.
* No Strings Attached: working with Farnham Maltings to ensure disabled young people felt able and supported to apply – resulting in 3 of the 7 awards being made to young disabled artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.farnhammaltings.com/portfolio/no-strings-attached/|title=No Strings Attached: Farnham Maltings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Auditing Brighton Dome and Festival in relation to programming and marketing and supporting an increase in accessible performances and associated research. 
* Access audit and investment in improvements at Summerhall, Edinburgh

==Unlimited International==

Announced in 2016, Unlimited International is a 3-year programme that exists primarily to fund international collaborations between disabled artists/companies from England and those from around the world, enabling a global exchange of practice.

The first collaborations announced were:
* [[Pallant House Gallery]] is working with Atelier Corners from Japan to exhibit the visual art work of three of their group: Koji Nishioka , Makoto Ohkawa and Yasuyuki Ueno across the summer and autumn 2016
* Drake Music will work with Brazilian rapper Billy Saga, arranging performances and workshops throughout England in September 2016
* Watershed will work with Unlimited and ANAT  in Australia to profile an event focusing on UNFIXED – a process exploring disability, technology and art.

Further international collaborations were announced as part of 2017 commissions announcement (see above).

{{VG Industry}}
The '''video game industry''' is the [[economic sector]] involved in the [[Video game development|development]], marketing, and [[Video game monetization|monetization of video games]]. It encompasses dozens of [[job]] disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Zackariasson, P. and Wilson, T.L. eds. (2012). ''The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, faster [[CPU]]s, and dedicated co-processors like [[PhysX]] are a few of the more notable improvements.

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref name="sndhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alldidigames.com/video-games-industry-infographics/ | publisher=Didi Games | work=Research on Video Games | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Didi Games | accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; Later, graphic cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt;

== Game industry value chain ==
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
# Product and talent layer: includes [[Video game developer|developers]], [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as [[smartphones]]. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.&lt;ref name="newmedia"&gt;

== Disciplines ==
The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2965/2526#36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s–1960s ===

{{main|Early history of video games|Early mainframe games}}
Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not "video games", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 "Nimatron", an electromagentic relay-based [[Nim]]-playing device designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]],&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|title=The Priesthood At Play: Computer Games in the 1950s |work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-01-22|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172058/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]],&lt;ref name="CNE"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlene|last=Simmons|title=Bertie the Brain programmer heads science council |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=916,3790974&amp;dq=josef-kates&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=1975-10-09|page=17|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] created by engineering firm [[Ferranti]] for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Replay: The History of Video Games]]|last=Donovan|first=Tristan|publisher=Yellow Ant|date=2010-04-20|isbn=978-0-9565072-0-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[cathode ray tube]]&amp;mdash;the core technology behind televisions&amp;mdash;created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a "cathode ray tube amusement device". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofplay.org/about/icheg/video-game-history/timeline |title=Video Game History Timeline &amp;#124; The Strong |publisher=Museumofplay.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|title=One, Two, Three, Four I Declare a Space War|work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-08-07|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172136/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of easy-to-program languages like [[BASIC]] for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

However, both the arcade and home markets would be dominated by ''Pong'' clones, which flooded the market and led to the [[video game crash of 1977]]. The crash eventually came to an end with the success of [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'', released in 1978, sparking a renaissance for the video game industry and paving the way for the [[golden age of video arcade games]].&lt;ref name="Whittaker-122"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=122|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The early part of the decade saw the rise of [[8-bit]] home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs.
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt; while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]] and [[Gremlin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html|title=World of Spectrum - Archive - YS Top 100|work=worldofspectrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:PlayStation-SCPH-1000-with-Controller.png|thumb|right|The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] was the most popular gaming console of the fifth generation, which saw the common adoption of CD media.]]
{{see also|History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}}

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]]

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, [[brand licensing|licensed]] games became more popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/896/896893p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Madden - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurby |first=Patrick |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden |title=ESPN - OTL: The Franchise - E-ticket |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did video game sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/954/954426p2.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
{{see also|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|History of video game consoles (seventh generation)}}

In 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as [[Smartphones]], [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s were developed and become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Game development for mobile phones (such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of $300 million.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/ |title=Zynga Takes $180 Million Venture Round From DST, Others (Cue Russian Mafia Jokes) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===
{{see also|History of video game consoles (eighth generation)}}

Though not the main driving force, [[independent video games|indie games]] continue to have a significant impact on the industry, with sales of some of these titles such as ''[[Spelunky]]'', ''[[Fez]]'', ''[[Don't Starve]]'', ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', and ''[[Minecraft]]'', exceeding millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]] and over a million users.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurial-insights.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/gaming-industry-introduction/|title=The Gaming Industry – An Introduction|work=Entrepreneurial Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|date=February 2017}} The 2010s have seen a larger shift to casual and [[mobile gaming]]; in 2016, the mobile gaming market is estimated to have taken $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-24-welcome-to-the-new-era-games-as-media | title = Welcome to the New Era: Games as Media | first = Joost | last = van Dreunen | date = October 24, 2016 | accessdate = October 31, 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Games centered on [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] equipment also arose during this decade. As of 2014, newer game companies arose that vertically integrate live operations and publishing such as crowdfunding and other direct-to-consumer efforts, rather than relying on a traditional publishers, and some of these have grown to substantial size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/business-startup-development-and-more/50e5d9379521 |title=The Future of Games and How to Stop It |last1=Radoff |first1=Jon |last2= |first2= |date=February 10, 2014 |website=medium.com |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred by some initial events in the late 2000s, [[eSports]] centered around professional players in organized competitions and leagues for prize money, grew greatly over this decade, drawing hundreds of millions of viewers and reaching nearly $500 million in revenue by 2016 and expected to break $1 billion by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/29/sport/esports-revolution-revenue-audience-growth/index.html | title = ESports: Global revenue expected to smash $1 billion by 2019 | first = Don | last=  Riddell | date = May 29, 2016 | accessdate = January 16, 2018  | work = [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s.  In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Superannuation|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?|url=http://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649|website=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method [[Video game monetization|to sell or earn money from]] the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs and increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Why Digital Distribution Is The Future And GameStop Is Not: Taking The Long View On Used Games|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/05/30/why-digital-distribution-is-the-future-and-gamestop-is-not-taking-the-long-view-on-used-games/|website=Forbes|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over $650 [[United States dollar|USD]] million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022802/http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision |date=January 25, 2011 }}.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of [[Triple A (gaming)|high-budget, high-quality titles]] under development. In 2013 [[Richard Hilleman]] of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="vgchartz20130706"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251108/ea-aaa-development-in-decline/ | title=EA: AAA Development in Decline | work=VGChartz | date=July 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013 | author=D'Angelo, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

The games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as [[GameStop]], following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as [[Blockbuster (company)|Blockbuster]], [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], and [[Virgin Megastores]]. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wingfield |first1=Nick |title=As Downloads Take Over, a Turning Point for the Video Game Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-12-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/technology/as-downloads-take-over-a-turning-point-for-the-video-game-industry.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=GAME launches Belong - is this the future of video games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-12-16 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-15-game-launches-belong-is-this-the-future-of-video-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |last2=Totilo |first2=Stephen |title=Video Game Retail Sales Decline Despite New Hits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-10-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/video-games/video-game-retail-sales-decline-despite-new-hits.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=What's going wrong at UK games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-21 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-21-whats-going-wrong-at-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more in this source --&gt; Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=Is the industry's obsession with Day One coming to an end? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-08 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-is-the-industrys-obsession-with-day-one-coming-to-an-end |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV UK]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: trade-in myths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &amp;#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[Freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] (faked) transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video game industry continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].

=== Gaming conventions ===
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry.

[[Image:Gamescom 2009 - Koelnmesse Südeingang (5473).jpg|thumb|The [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]], the major gaming fair by attendance.]]
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Other notable conventions and trade fairs include [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo &amp; Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.

=== Africa ===

Video gaming is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as [[video gaming in South Africa|South Africa]], [[video gaming in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[video gaming in Kenya|Kenya]] have been making rapid advances in [[mobile gaming|mobile game development]], both within their country and internationally,&lt;ref name="Africa top 10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/10/top-10-african-game-developers/|title=Top 10 African game developers|publisher=''[[IT News Africa]]''|last=Fripp|first=Charlie|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.&lt;ref name="Mail &amp; Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-02-things-africa-will-be-famous-for-in-the-next-10-15-years|title=Africa 2030, the next 25 years: From video games, eco-buildings, robotics, and cycling|publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] Africa''|last=Spooner|first=Samantha|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive Entertainment]] and [[Strategy First]], mainly because video games jobs have been heavily subsidized by the provincial government. Every year, this industry generates billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in the Montreal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourisme-montreal.org/meetings/2015/01/20/business-sectors/|title=What are the leading business sectors in Montréal?

The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, along with the ''[[Tom Clancy]]'' series have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success. For consumers, the largest video games convention in Canada is the Enthusiast Gaming Live Expo (EGLX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Carignan |url=https://www.destructoid.com/dtoid-is-hosting-canada-s-largest-gaming-event-eglx-returns-march-9-11-2018-469022.phtml |title=Dtoid is hosting Canada's largest gaming event!

{{main|Video gaming in Germany}}

[[Germany]] has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion forecast for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-100-countries-by-game-revenues/|title=Top 100 Countries By Game Revenues|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=newzoo.com|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] is Europe's largest gaming expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]] (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. The [[Anno (series)|Anno series]] and [[The Settlers|The Settlers series]] are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The [[Gothic series]], [[SpellForce: The Order of Dawn|SpellForce]] and [[Risen (video game)|Risen]] are established RPG franchises. The [[X (game series)|X series]] by [[Egosoft]] is the best-selling space simulation. The [[FIFA Manager (video game series)|FIFA Manager series]] was also developed in Germany. The German action game [[Spec Ops: The Line]] (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is ''[[Far Cry]]'' (2004) by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced the topseller ''[[Crysis]]'' and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include [[Ascaron]], [[Blue Byte]], [[Deck13 Interactive|Deck13]], [[EA Phenomic|Phenomic]], [[Piranha Bytes]], [[Radon Labs|Radon]], [[Related Designs|Related]], [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[Yager Development]]. Publishers include [[Deep Silver]] ([[Koch Media]]), [[dtp entertainment]], [[Kalypso Media|Kalypso]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo Europe]]. [[Bigpoint Games]], [[Gameforge]], [[Goodgame Studios]] and [[Wooga]] are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

=== Japan ===
{{main|Video gaming in Japan}}
[[File:Nintendo office.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Nintendo]] in [[Kyoto]], Japan, 2006.]]
The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.

&lt;!-- Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;
Japanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the ''[[Mario]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of games.

&lt;!-- [[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general. --&gt;
In recent years, [[video game console|consoles]] and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable [[free-to-play]] games on the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms.&lt;ref name=economist12&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan fights back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21566696-two-japanese-firms-are-challenging-world-new-kind-video-game-japan-fights-back|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capcom_marketdata&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} --&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{main|Video gaming in the United Kingdom}}

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed.&lt;ref name="networkworld1"/&gt; The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-04-04-view-from-the-tower|title=The View From the Tower|publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Codemasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Colin McRae Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]''.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625151807/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[Magnavox]] is credited for releasing the first [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. [[Activision]] was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, [[Atari]] crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Companies====
The U.S. is home to major game development companies such as [[Activision Blizzard]] (''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]''), [[Electronic Arts]] (''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]''), and [[Take-Two Interactive]] ([[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], [[NBA 2K (series)|''NBA 2K'' series]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). [[ZeniMax Media]] (''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'') is the world's largest privately held video game company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Zenimax+Claims+Carmack+Stole+Oculus+VR+Facebook+Barks+Back/article34869.htm|title=Zenimax Claims Carmack Stole Oculus VR, Facebook Barks Back|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic]] (''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'', ''[[Pokémon Go]]'') is a notable mobile game developer.

[[Valve Corporation]] operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/|title=VGChartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by [[Google]] ([[Google Play]]), and [[Apple Inc.]] ([[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia.&lt;ref name=idcannie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-idc-portable-gaming-report-2013-q2/|author=App Annie, IDC|title=App Annie &amp; IDC Portable Gaming Report Q2 2013: iOS &amp; Google Play Game Revenue 4x Higher Than Gaming-Optimized Handhelds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] operates [[Xbox]], the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company.

Notable game engine developers include [[Epic Games]] ([[Unreal Engine]]) and [[Unity Technologies]] ([[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]).

====Regions====
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is home to important video game conventions, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in [[North America]]. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Seattle]]. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Texas]].

====People====
Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/industry-facts/|title=Industry Facts|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/article/new-study-finds-video-game-players-are-highly-engaged-politically/|title=New Study Finds Video Game Players Are Highly Engaged Politically|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mario]] is named after [[Mario Segale]], a former landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]. Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] activists, including [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Anita Sarkeesian]], have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ | title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides | author= Allum Bokhari | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate= September 27, 2014|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt;

The industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220–221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, "Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=222|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the class of words|Profanity}}
'''Vulgarity''' is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined.  This judgement may refer to [[language]], [[visual art]], [[social class]]es, or [[social climber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bayley claims it can never be [[self-referential]] because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of [[sophistication]] which thereby elevates the subject above the [[:wikt:vulgar|vulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/4/298 |title=Vulgarity |author=John Bayley |journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1964 |volume=4 |pages=298–304 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/4.4.298 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, "vulgar" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country.  From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: "having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred".  In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior.  In a [[George Eliot]] novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|pages=1–10|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words.  In [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Beauchamp's Career]]'', an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is "engaged", nor "betrothed", "affianced", or "plighted".  Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as ''[[toilet]]'' eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of "[[cultural capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|page=17|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Vulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or [[Obscenity|obscene]], [[synonym]]ous with the 'general' meaning of [[profanity]].

The word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is "cursing." However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, "Cursing in America" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the "dirty words" because it "allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered  taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is ''fuck''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomquist, Robert F. "The F-Word: A Jurisprudential Taxonomy of American Morals (In a Nutshell)." Santa Clara L. Rev. 40 (1999): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cursing ===
Curse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
Religious curses may include "Damn you", "God damn you", "To hell with you". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like "Fuck you" or "Eat shit and die".

=== Profanity ===
Profanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. 

For a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's cinema''' is a variety of topics bundled together to create the work of women in film.  This can include women filling behind the scene roles such as director, cinematographer, writer, and producer while also addressing the stories of women and character development through screenplays.

Renowned female directors include [[Kathryn Bigelow]], who is the only woman to receive an academy award for best director&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/08/kathryn-bigelow-oscars-best-director|title=Kathryn Bigelow makes history as first woman to win best director Oscar|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=2010-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, along with many other women directors from around the world such as [[Mary Harron]], [[Jane Campion]], [[Sofia Coppola]], and [[Catherine Hardwicke]].  Many successful cinematographers are also women, including [[Maryse Alberti]], [[Reed Morano]] and Zoe White. 

Women's cinema recognizes women's contributions all over the world, not only to narrative films but to documentaries as well.  Recognizing the work of women occurs through various festivals and awards, such as the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Cinema: The Contested Screen|last=Butler|first=Alison|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2002|isbn=9781903364277|location=|pages=1–3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women's cinema is a complex, critical, theoretical, and institutional construction", Alison Butler explains.  The concept has had its fair share of criticisms, causing some female filmmakers to distance themselves from it in fear of be associated with marginalization and ideological controversy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Famous women in film history==

===Silent films===
[[Alice Guy-Blaché]] was a film pioneer and likely the first female director. Working for the [[Gaumont Film Company]] in France at the time that the cinema was being invented, she created ''[[La Fée aux Choux]]'' (1896). The dates of many early films are speculative, but ''La Fée aux Choux'' may well be the first narrative film ever released.&lt;ref name="Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Joan|title=Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer|isbn=978-0-300-15250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Gaumont's head of production from 1896 to 1906 and ultimately produced hundreds of [[silent film]]s in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/alice-guy-blache/|title=Education &amp; Resources – National Women's History Museum – NWHM|website=www.nwhm.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American-born director, [[Lois Weber]] was coached and inspired by Guy-Blaché and found success in creating silent films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/lois-weber/|title=Education &amp; Resources – National Women's History Museum – NWHM|website=www.nwhm.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber is well known for her films [[The Hypocrites (1915 film)|''Hypocrites'']] (1915), ''[[The Blot]]'' (1921), and ''[[Suspense (1913 film)|Suspense]]'' (1913). Weber's films often focus on difficult social issues. For instance, her film ''[[Where Are My Children?]] (1916)'' addresses the controversial issues of [[birth control]] and [[abortion]]. And she questioned the validity of [[capital punishment]] in ''[[The People vs. John Doe]]'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lois_Weber.aspx|title=Lois Weber Facts, information, pictures |website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mabel Normand]] was another significant early female filmmaker. She started as an actress and became a producer-writer-director in the 1910s, working on the first shorts [[Charlie Chaplin]] did as [[The Tramp]] at [[Mack Sennett]]'s [[Keystone Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/en/filming/articles/212-Chaplin-at-Keystone-The-Tramp-is-Born|title=Charlie Chaplin : Chaplin at Keystone: The Tramp is Born|website=www.charliechaplin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further collaborated with Sennett on other Keystone films and, during the late 1910s and early 1920s, she had her own movie studio and production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harper Fussell| first = Betty| authorlink = Betty Fussell| publisher = Limelight Editions| edition=   Illustrated| year= 1992| title = Mabel: Hollywood's First I-Don't-Care Girl| isbn = 978-0-87910-158-9| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pd4nAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=isbn%3A9780879101589| accessdate = July 29, 2010| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women screenwriters were highly sought after in the early years of the cinema. [[Frances Marion]], [[Anita Loos]], and [[June Mathis]] all had successful careers in the silent and early-sound eras. Mathis was also the first female executive in [[Hollywood]].

In Sweden, [[Anna Hofman-Uddgren]] was that country's first female film maker—producing the silent film ''[[Stockholmsfrestelser]]'' in 1911. She also acted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marika V. Lagercrantz |chapter-url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-20370 |chapter=En oavslutad berättelse. Om varietéstjärnan Anna Hofmann |year=2009 |title=Kulturellt: Reflektioner i Erling Bjurströms anda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Hollywood===
As the American cinema became a highly commercialized industry in the 1920s and its content became more and more conventionalized, the opportunities for women producers and directors became fewer and fewer. By the time sound arrived in the US in 1927 and the years immediately after, women's roles behind the camera were largely limited to scriptwriters, costume designers, set decorators, make-up artists, and the like. And the industry's implementation of self-censorship in the form of the [[Hays Code]] in 1934 meant that topics such as birth control and abortion were taboo. [[Dorothy Arzner]] was the only woman director to survive in this unfriendly environment. She did so by producing well made but formally rather conventional films. Nevertheless, it is possible to trace feminist elements in her films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite av media|title=The Women Who Run Hollywood|author=Clara Kuperberg, Julia Kuperberg|year=2016|work= Wichita Films|format=documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics find her film, ''[[Dance, Girl, Dance]]'', about two women struggling to make it in show business, to be particularly interesting from a feminist perspective. When the film was selected for inclusion in the [[National Film Registry]], it was noted that "The dancers, played by [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Lucille Ball]], strive to preserve their own feminist integrity, while fighting for their place in the spotlight and for the love of male lead [[Louis Hayward]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2007.html Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007], from the [[Library of Congress]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond ''Dance, Girl, Dance'', Arzner also worked with some of Hollywood's most formidable actresses—including [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Christopher Strong]]'' (1933) and [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937).

===Experimental and avant-garde cinema===
The experimental and avant-garde cinema is the genre considered to be closer to women filmmakers and one that also advances women themes. Annette Kuhn, for instance, noted such special affinity by citing that low investments of money and 'professionalism' have meant that it is more open than the mainstream film industry for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Cinema: The Contested Screen|last=Butler|first=Alison|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2002|isbn=1903364272|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Pam Cook]] and [[Laura Mulvey]] also noted an alignment and alliance of experimental and avant-garde cinema with feminist interest and feminist politics. Specifically, Mulvey explained that mainstream or Hollywood films are unable to provide the experience of contradiction, reinforcing anti-realism and, this is where the avant-garde cinema is useful for women and feminism because they share "a common interest in the politics of images and problems of aesthetic language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visual and Other Pleasures|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Palgrave|year=1989|isbn=9780333445297|location=New York|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's involvement in the experimental and avant-garde cinema started in the early twentieth century, although it was limited due to the constraints of the social conventions of this period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was only after the war when women became actively involved in this cinematic genre. [[Germaine Dulac]] was a leading member of the French avant-garde film movement after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41086659|title=The St. James women filmmakers encyclopedia : women on the other side of the camera|last=|first=|date=1999|publisher=Visible Ink Press|others=Unterburger, Amy L.|year=|isbn=9781578590926|location=Detroit|pages=122–124|oclc=41086659}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of [[Maya Deren]]'s visionary films, which belonged to the classics of experimental cinema and focused on the North-American avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45888927|title=Maya Deren and the American avant-garde|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|others=Nichols, Bill, 1942-|isbn=0520224442|location=Berkeley|oclc=45888927}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporaneous trend did not oppose the female filmmakers' entry into avant-garde filmmaking although, in its early years, they did not receive as much critical acclaim as their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Shirley Clarke]] was a leading figure of the independent American film scene in New York in the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Thomas|date=2012|title=After the New American Cinema: Shirley Clarke's Video Work as Performance and Document|url=|journal=Journal of Film &amp; Video|publication-date=Spring–Summer 2012|volume=64|pages=57–64|via=Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is unusual, insofar as she directed outstanding experimental and feature films as well as documentaries. [[Joyce Wieland]] was a Canadian [[experimental film]] maker. The [[National Film Board of Canada]] allowed many women to produce non-commercial animation films. In Europe women artists like [[Valie Export]] were among the first to explore the artistic and political potential of [[video]]s.

== Impact on society ==

===Impact of second-wave feminism===
In the late sixties, when the second wave of [[feminism]] started, the New Left was at its height. Both movements strongly opposed the 'dominant cinema', i.e. Hollywood and male European bourgeois auteur cinema. Hollywood was accused of furthering oppression by disseminating sexist, racist and imperialist stereotypes. Women participated in mixed new collectives like [[Newsreel]], but they also formed their own film groups. Early feminist films often focused on personal experiences. A first masterpiece was ''[[Wanda (film)|Wanda]]'' by [[Barbara Loden]], one of the most poignant portraits of alienation ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ENELOW|first=SHONNI|date=September–October 2017|title=STRONGER TOGETHER|url=|journal=Film Comment|volume=53|pages=50–55|via=Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism would reveal itself in different forms in films in the latter part of the 20th century such as with the idea of "sisterhoods" in movies, a good example of which is ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism, Femininity and Popular Culture|last=Hollows|first=Joanne|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|isbn=0719043956|location=Manchester, U.K. ; New York, N.Y.|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other concepts of second-wave feminism in films involved women's oppression and the difficulty in identifying with the idea of femininity. During this time, feminism in movies would also be represented as a counter-cinema&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema Book 3rd rev. edition|last=Cook|first=Pam (ed.)|last2=Anneke M.|first2=Smelik|publisher=London: British Film Institute|year=2007|isbn=9781844571925|location=London, U.K.|pages=492|chapter=Feminist Film Theory|chapter-url=https://repository.ubn.ru.nl//bitstream/handle/2066/44160/44160.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby filmmakers would attempt to intentionally deconstruct the model of the classical film. This style of feminist counter-cinema can be seen in the works of artists such as [[Sally Potter]]'s ''Thriller'' in 1979.

===Representing sexuality===
Resisting the oppression of female sexuality was one of the core goals of [[second-wave feminism]]. [[Abortion]] was still very controversial in many western societies and feminists opposed the control of the state and the church. Exploring female sexuality took many forms: focusing on long-time censured forms of sexuality ([[lesbianism]], [[sado-masochism]]) or showing heterosexuality from a woman's point of view.
[[Birgit Hein]], [[Elfi Mikesch]], [[Nelly Kaplan]], [[Catherine Breillat]] and [[Barbara Hammer]] are some of the directors to be remembered.

A film notable for its empathic portrayal of sex work is Lizzie Borden's ''[[Working Girls (1986 film)|Working Girls]]'' (1986). Molly, a white lesbian in a stable mixed-race relationship, is a Yale-educated photographer who has chosen to augment her income through sex work in a low-key urban brothel. We accompany Molly on what turns out to be her last day on the job, understanding her professional interactions with her "johns" through her perspective, a completely original point of view, since, until Borden's film, sex workers had largely been depicted stereotypically. The story's sympathetic, well-rounded character and situation humanizes sex work, and the film itself combats the anti-pornography stance touted by many second-wave feminists, which Borden rejects as repressive.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Glynis, Alexandra Devon, and Catehrina Tammaro.

Typically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented. The roles that men play are the superhero, the wealthy business man or the all-powerful villain. When it comes to the roles females play they tend to be the housewife, the woman who can't obtain a man, the slut, or the secretary. The true comparison is masculinity versus femininity. The [[Bechdel test]] for film is a type of litmus test that examines the representation of women in media. The 3 factors tested are: 1. Are there at least 2 women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma &amp; Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or limits their role. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this norm, such as ''[[The Proposal (2009 film)|The Proposal]]'' or ''[[I Don't Know How She Does It]]''. Even in these two films, the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this norm, such as Katniss in ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|Hunger Games]]'' and Furiosa in ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''. These roles break the norm, as women typically are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low-status jobs  compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and underrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Jocelyn Nicole, "The role of women in film: Supporting the men -- An analysis of how culture influences the changing discourse on gender representations in film" (2015).

=== Fear of entering cinematography ===
Many women fear(ed) even entering the film industry, let alone produce multiple pieces of work in the industry. It is said that both male and female workers believe hiring women into the industry is taking a big chance, or being risky.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handy|first=Jocelyn|last2=Rowlands|first2=Lorraine|date=2016-07-21|title=The systems psychodynamics of gendered hiring: Personal anxieties and defensive organizational practices within the New Zealand film industry|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018726716651690|journal=Human Relations|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=312–338|doi=10.1177/0018726716651690|issn=0018-7267}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many discriminatory acts toward women during the hiring process into the industry such as age discrimination and providing them with lower pay rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Most women workers in the film industry only become freelancers, which in most cases prevents them from creating careers and making a living out of their film/cinematography passion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wing-Fai|first=Leung|last2=Gill|first2=Rosalind|last3=Randle|first3=Keith|date=May 2015|title=Getting in, Getting on, Getting out? Women as Career Scramblers in the UK film and Television Industries|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12240|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1_suppl|pages=50–65|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12240|issn=0038-0261|via=Sage Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Wing-Fai, 2015). These are the fear tactics in place, whether purposely or not, to prevent women from thriving in the film industry.

However, there is much more gendered discrimination towards women after they receive the job and actually begin to help and/or produce work. Statistics show that there is not many women in senior positions in the industry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Compared to the amount of women hired, it is clearly shown that women are not given the chance to keep their jobs for long periods of time. “However, it is notable that women lost their jobs at a rate that was six times that of men, indicating the particular and heightened vulnerability of women in the industry.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women are not being promoted into higher positions as often as their male counterparts and are not even given the chance to stay long enough to get promoted. These are multiple issues happening during the hiring process and even the post-hire experiences of women which may make other women fear entering the industry in the first place.

The way women are treated in the workplace are also evidence of the inequalities against them in the film industry. Women’s pay rates and expectations in their background/experience in cinematography is much different than male workers. There are many scenarios in the industry that displays the woman with more qualifications for the job than the man, yet earns less money for the same job than the man.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Deborah|last2=Pringle|first2=Judith K.|date=May 2015|title=Unmanageable Inequalities: Sexism in the Film Industry|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12239|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1_suppl|pages=37–49|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12239|issn=0038-0261|via=Sage Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; “It is worth noting that women in this field are significantly better qualified than their male counterparts, with a greater proportion being graduates and an even more significant difference in the numbers of women, compared to men, with higher degrees (Skillset, 2010a: 6).”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Even the women who are overqualified are treated as if they are not, resulting in them working extra hard to become better and be rewarded as their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  All of these inequalities and discrimination toward women in the film industry creates a fear for women to even want to enter the industry.

===Resisting violence and violent resistance===
Resisting patriarchal violence was a key concern of second-wave feminism during the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Pilar Rodriguez|date=November 2011|title=Feminism and Violence: The Hegemonic Second Wave’s Encounter with Rape and Domestic Abuse in USA (1970-1985)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0921374011430566|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume=23|issue=3|pages=147–172|doi=10.1177/0921374011430566|issn=0921-3740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many feminists of the second wave have taken part in the peace movements of the eighties, as had their foremothers in the older pacifist movements. The effects that war conflict had on women following the cold war was often overlooked. Post cold-war conflicts resulted in women being subjected to increased forms of torture, rape, and violence.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Citation|last=El-Bushra|first=Judy|title=Feminism, Gender, and Women's Peace Activism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781444306675.ch7|work=Gender Myths and Feminist Fables|pages=127–143|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|isbn=9781444306675|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an increase in women’s peace organizations and initiatives to protest violence against women, resulting in more criticism of the patriarchal cliché of the 'peaceable' woman.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Women film directors documented the participation of women in anti-imperialist resistance movements. Inspired by the Hindu goddess Mother Kali--who is traditionally associated with sexuality, violence, and motherly-tenderness-- German filmmakers Birgit and Wilhelm Hein created their Kali Film, which depicts women as violent and threatening, the opposite of the innocent “caretaker” stereotype generally assigned to women characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bampfa.org/event/kali-film|title=Kali Film {{!}} BAMPFA|website=bampfa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers assembled found footage from 'trivial' genres, the only domain of cinema in which the portrayal of aggressive women was allowed. 

Filmmakers have also begun to take on representations of sexuality and gender in films directed specifically at college students. As campus sexual assault continues to pervade universities, filmmakers have started to create films that address these issues. In 2014 a group of students and faculty at Texas Tech University created the film series “Sexism | Cinema,” to provide education on violence against women and sexual abuse on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=John B.

=== Statistics ===
A study done by USC Annenberg researched what it meant to be a female in the film industry, no matter if they were working behind the scenes or were fictional characters.  USC Annenberg looked at two test groups for films, the top 100 films every year from 2007 to 2015 and the top 100 films in 2015.

For the top 100 films in 2015, women were leads and co-leads in 32 of them, while of the 32 films, only 3 of them included a race other than Caucasian.  Out of the thousands of speaking roles, only 32 characters were LGBT and of those characters, 40% of them were racially diverse.  Female characters were also three times more likely to be seen in a sexual context.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dr. Stacy|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|year=2016|title=Inequality in 800 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race/Ethnicity, LGBT, and Disability from 2007-2015|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Dr%20Stacy%20L%20Smith%20Inequality%20in%20800%20Films%20FINAL.ashx|journal=USC Annenburg|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the scenes had similar statistics to the female fictional characters.  Female directors, writers, and producers made up 19% of the 1,365 people that it took to create the top 100 films in 2015.  The percentage of female writers (11.8%) and producers (22%) can be seen as high compared to female directors (7.5%).  Of the 7.5% of female directors, three of them were African American and one was Asian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For the top 100 films every year from 2007 until 2015, of the 800 films, 4.1% were directed by females.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Documentaries ===
While there is still a gap between the percent of female and male filmmakers, women tend to be more involved in documentary films.  There is a higher percentage of women directing documentaries than women directing narrative films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauren|first=Martha|year=2013|title=The Celluloid Ceiling: Behind the Scenes Employment of Women on Top 250 Films of 2015|url=http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/2012_Celluloid_Ceiling_Exec_Summ.pdf|journal=Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celluloid ceiling ===
The Center of the Study of Women in Television and Film has dedicated 18 years to the study of women in the film industry.  An annual report is created, discussing how women have contributed to as filmmakers.  Most of the findings from the research shows that, statistically, it says the same from year to year.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|title=Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest earning movies of the past 20 years, with the exception of foreign films and reissues, have been monitored and studied by the Celluloid Ceiling to provide information on the contributions and employment of women on these films.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/research/|title=Research – Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, as of 2017, “women comprised 18% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films."&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;The same study concluded that in 2017, 10 or more women were given one of these positions in 1% of films, compared to 10 or more men being hired for these jobs in 70% of films.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;Information from the Celluloid Ceiling shows that more women tend to be employed on film projects directed by women.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;According to the Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy, "in films with at least one female director, women comprised 53% of writers.

The group also contributes their time to creating articles discussing how women are viewed in film, not only as filmmakers but as fictional characters as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==African American women's cinema==
[[Julie Dash]]'s ''[[Daughters of the Dust]]'' (1991) was the first full-length film with general theatrical release written and directed by an [[African American]] woman. Since then there have been several African or African-American women who have written, produced or directed films with national release. [[Neema Barnette]] (''[[Civil Brand]]''), [[Maya Angelou]] (''[[Down in the Delta]]''), [[Kasi Lemmons]] (''[[Eve's Bayou]]''), [[Cheryl Dunye]] (''[[My Baby's Daddy]]''), [[Stephanie Allain]] (''[[Biker Boyz]]''), [[Tracey Edmonds]] (''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]''), [[Frances-Anne Solomon]] (''[[A Winter Tale]]'') and [[Dianne Houston]] (''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]''), [[Leslie Harris (director)|Leslie Harris]] ([[Just Another Girl on the IRT]]) are among these filmmakers. In 1994 Darnell Martin became the first African American woman to write and direct a film produced by a major studio when Columbia Pictures backed ''[[I Like It Like That (film)|I Like It Like That]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-23/entertainment/9410230140_1_story-of-lisette-linares-film-transvestite-brother|title=She Likes It Like That|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the first African woman film director to gain international recognition was the [[Senegal]]ese [[Ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Safi Faye]] with a film about the village in which she was born (''[[Kaddu Beykat|Letter from the Village]]'', 1975). The 1989 [[Créteil International Women's Film Festival]] included short films by [[Leonie Yangba Zowe]] of the [[Central African Republic]] (''Yangba-Bola'' and ''Lengue'', 1985) and [[Flora M'mbugu-Schelling]] of [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn1990Africa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela Martin|editor=Annette Kuhn|title=The Women's Companion to International Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjqOM04aGJ8C&amp;pg=PA4|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08879-5|pages=4–8|chapter=Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other African women filmmakers include [[Anne Mungai]], [[Fanta Régina Nacro]] (''[[The Night of Truth]]'', 2004), Tsitsi Dangarembga (''Mother's Day'', 2004) and [[Marguerite Abouet]], an Ivorian graphic novel writer who co-directed an animated film based on her graphic novel: [[Aya de Yopougon (film)|Aya de Yopougon]] (2012).
