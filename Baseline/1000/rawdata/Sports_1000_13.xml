==Methodology==
Ranks and scores are assigned by weighing various indicators and rewarding or penalizing the city as appropriate.  These indicators are classified into two broad categories: ''Personal Health'', which measures the health habits and outcomes for city residents, including their physical activity, diet, and chronic health problems, and ''Community and Environment'', which includes scores to measure the availability and convenience of local parks, farmers' markets, alternative transportation, and community recreation facilities like pools, tennis courts, and baseball diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/methodology/|title=Methodology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assistive technology in sport''' is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive technology may be used in [[disabled sports]], where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.

An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new assistive technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|pages=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology devices can be simple, "low-tech", or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple or advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technologies|url=http://www.understandingdisability.org/AssistiveTechnologies|publisher=Spaulding Framingham|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to elite Paralympic games. More complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities "have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|pages=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistive devices==
Assistive devices can enable exercise and training, on top of enabling participation in a sport. Below are some of the assistive devices currently available for different impairments:

* Mobility impairments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illness and Disability: Gear for sports and fitness |url=http://www.girlshealth.gov/disability/disbody/assist.cfm |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916081925/http://www.girlshealth.gov/disability/disbody/assist.cfm |archivedate=September 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technologies|url=http://www.understandingdisability.org/AssistiveTechnologies|publisher=Spaulding Framingham|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technology 101 |url=http://www.fctd.info/factsheet/at101 |publisher=The Family Center on Technology and Disability |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917140937/http://www.fctd.info/factsheet/at101 |archivedate=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Light-weight wheelchairs for basketball, tennis, and racing
** All-terrain wheelchairs with rugged frames and wheels for rolling over unpaved surfaces, like hiking trails, snow, or beach sand
** [[Handcycle]]s, or [[recumbent bicycle]]s, which are like bicycles with pedals and steering using only the rider's arms
** Cross-country sit skis that allow skiers to sit down and push along the trail with tips that dig into the snow
** Weights that users strap onto their wrists rather than having to hold them with the hands
** Gym equipment that lets users stay in a wheelchair while using arm exercise machines

Many of the sports listed above have attained international elite sport status, being included in the [[Paralympic Games]].

===Sports requiring assistive technology===
Some sports have developed with the goal of creating a challenge that players with a disability could enjoy. These sports require assistive technology for all players as part of the game. Some examples are: [[Sled hockey|Sledge (sled) hockey]]; [[wheelchair basketball]]; [[adaptive sailing]], with boats designed especially for sailors with disabilities; [[Nordic skiing|Nordic (cross-country) skiing]] with "sit-ski" buckets; and [[handcycle|handcycling]] races.

==Sport wheelchair design==
Sport wheelchairs are designed for the requirements of specific sports. Power chairs can also be fitted with assistive devices that are temporary adaptations to the demands of a sport, such as a kick plate attached to a power chair for [[powerchair football]] (power soccer).

Light-weight frames are a necessity for wheelchairs used in sports requiring sharp, fast turns and overall agility, such as tennis, basketball, and racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technology 101 |url=http://www.fctd.info/factsheet/at101 |publisher=The Family Center on Technology and Disability |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917140937/http://www.fctd.info/factsheet/at101 |archivedate=September 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairs with reinforced frames and impact protection are required for contact sports, such as [[wheelchair rugby]] or [[wheelchair basketball|basketball]].

Racing chairs are designed with bucket seats, angled wheels for improved stability, and a t-frame with a third wheel in front, allowing precision steering as well as improving balance. The athlete and wheelchair are viewed together by some sport researchers as a unified performance system. Improvements can be made to chairs by evaluating the chair and athlete separately or in performance conditions together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winnick|first=Joseph P.|title=Adapted Physical Education and Sport|year=2010|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736089180|pages=572, 575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Prosthetics==
Prosthetic devices come in a variety of designs suited to different athletic purposes. Prosthetic legs may be designed for rock climbing, running, or jumping. The technology is designed to attain goals such as greater [[gait]] efficiency when running. The technology is constantly improving, to meet the demands of athletes who set ever-higher sports challenges for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|pages=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African athlete [[Oscar Pistorius]], using energy-storing prosthetic legs, fought for the right to run against able-bodied athletes in the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and won the right to compete, although he did not meet the qualifying time required for the traditional able-bodied competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scherer, Marcia and Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|pages=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Functional classification==
Functional classification systems are used to evaluate and categorize athletes in elite sports, the classification determines the type and extent of assistive technology use by the athlete.

==Organizations==
Organizations and associations at the national and international level support the development of adaptive sport and recreation, often through the use of assistive technology for players. These organizations are "growing in number and scope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wendt|first=Oliver|title=Assistive Technology: Principles and Applications for Communication Disorders and Special Education|year=2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=9781780522944|pages=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Danny_Gabbidon_1.png|thumb|120px|[[Danny Gabbidon]] wearing a [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] away kit, 2012]]

'''Away colours''' are a choice of coloured clothing used in [[team sport]]s. They are required to be worn by one team during a game between teams that would otherwise wear the same colours as each other, or similar colours. This change prevents confusion for officials, players, and spectators. In most sports, it is the [[road (sports)|visiting or road team]] that must change – second-choice kits are commonly known as '''away kits''' or '''change kits''' in [[British English]], and '''road uniforms''' in [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|American English]].

Some sports leagues mandate that away teams must always wear an alternative kit, while others simply state that the two teams' colours should not match. In some sports, conventionally the ''home'' team has changed its kit (such as in [[rugby union]].

In most cases, a team wears its away kit only when its primary kit would clash with the colours of the home team. However, sometimes teams wear away colours by choice, occasionally even in a home game. At some clubs, the away kit has become more popular than the home version. Replica home and away kits are usually available for fans to buy. Some teams also have produced [[third jersey|third-choice kits]], or even old-fashioned [[throwback uniform]]s.

Most teams choose to wear their colour jerseys at home, with the road team changing to white in most cases.&lt;ref name="CVC"/&gt; White road uniforms gained prominence with the rise of television in the 1950s. A "white vs. color" game was easier to follow in [[black-and-white]].&lt;ref name="CVC"/&gt; According to Phil Hecken, "until the mid 1950′s, not only was color versus color common in the NFL, it was actually the norm."&lt;ref name="CVC"/&gt; Even long after the advent of colour television, the use of white jerseys has remained in almost every game.

The NFL's current rules require that a team's home jerseys must be "either white or official team color" throughout the season, "and visiting clubs must wear the opposite".&lt;ref name="NFL26"&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 4: Equipment, Uniforms, Player Appearance|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/8_Rule5_Players_Subs_Equip_GeneralRules.pdf#page=4|publisher=National Football League|date=August 29, 2012|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a team insists on wearing its home uniforms on the road, the [[History of the NFL Commissioner|NFL Commissioner]] must judge on whether their uniforms are "of sufficient contrast" with those of their opponents.&lt;ref name="NFL26"/&gt; The road team might instead wear a [[third jersey]], such as the [[Seattle Seahawks]]' "Wolf Grey" alternate.

Until 1964 Dallas had worn blue at home, but it was not an official rule that teams should wear their coloured jerseys at home.

In 2007, they wore a white throwback jersey.

The Dallas Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be "[[sports-related curses|jinxed]]" because of defeats at [[Super Bowl V]] in 1971 (when they were forced to wear their blue jerseys as the designated 'home' team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lukas |first=Paul |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/071025 |title=ESPN Page 2 – Uni Watch: How 'bout them Cowboys? |publisher=ESPN |date=October 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 28, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712070016/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas%2F071025 |archivedate=July 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in the [[1968 NFL playoffs|1968 divisional playoffs]] at Cleveland, [[Don Meredith]]'s final game as a Cowboys player. Dallas's only victory in a conference championship or Super Bowl wearing the blue jerseys was in the [[1978–79 NFL playoffs|1978 NFC Championship game]] at the Los Angeles Rams.

[[Super Bowl]] rules later changed to allow the [[Super Bowl#Home team designation|designated home team]] to pick their choice of jersey. White was chosen by the Cowboys ([[Super Bowl XIII|XIII]], [[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]]), the Redskins ([[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]]), the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] ([[Super Bowl XL|XL]]), the [[Denver Broncos]] ([[Super Bowl 50|50]]), and the [[New England Patriots]] ([[Super Bowl LII|LII]]).&lt;ref name="Denv50"&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Ben|title=Broncos to wear white uniforms in Super Bowl 50|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-to-wear-white-uniforms-in-Super-Bowl-50/26a247f5-91ef-4ff6-a11a-8278b089c5c3|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=January 25, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126222617/http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-to-wear-white-uniforms-in-Super-Bowl-50/26a247f5-91ef-4ff6-a11a-8278b089c5c3|archivedate=January 26, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter three teams normally wear colours at home, but Pittsburgh had worn white in [[2005–06 NFL playoffs|three road playoff wins]], while Denver cited its previous Super Bowl success in white jerseys ([[Super Bowl XXXIII|XXXIII]]), while being 0–4 when wearing orange in Super Bowls.

While they had only done so twice, both to "jinx" Dallas, during the 21 years they played in St. Louis, since [[History of the Los Angeles Rams|returning to Los Angeles]] in 2016, the Rams, temporarily playing in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|same stadium]] as they had in the 1960s, have worn white at home as a conscious tribute to the highly successful teams of that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=3k|title=

While a team's primary kit rarely undergoes major changes, the second colours tend to vary over time and sometimes by tournament. Some away kits are a modification of the home colours (for example a reversal of primary and secondary colours), other away kits are considerably different from home kits. Several club and national sides have favourite away colours which might remain the same more or less continuously. Often these are colours that were used in famous victories; for instance [[A.C. Milan]] (white) and Brazil (blue).  Many professional clubs also have an official [[Third jersey|third kit]], ostensibly to be used if both their first-choice and away colours are deemed too similar to those of an opponent.&lt;ref name="HFK" /&gt;

It is not unknown for teams to opt to wear their away colours even when not required to by a clash of colours. [[England national football team|England]] sometimes play in red shirts even when not required, as the team wore red when it won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] held on home soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamUnif/Unif.html |title=England's Uniforms – Player Kits |publisher=England Football Online |author=Glen Isherwood |accessdate=23 January 2008 |quote=England sometimes choose to wear their red at home even though they could wear their white, as against Germany in the last match played at Wembley Stadium.

In some title-deciding matches, a team has won the game wearing its away kit, but changed to home shirts for the trophy presentation – most notably when [[Spain national football team|Spain]] won the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|2010 World Cup final]] in their dark-blue away kit, but changed to red home shirts to lift the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/11/spain-wins-2010-world-cup/ "Spain Wins 2010 World Cup"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812060314/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/07/11/spain-wins-2010-world-cup/ |date=2012-08-12 }}, [[AOL]] News, July 11, 2010. Retrieved July 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases both teams have been forced to wear their second choice away kits; such as the match between Netherlands and Brazil in the [[1974_FIFA_World_Cup#Second_round|1974 FIFA World Cup]] where they wore white and dark blue rather than their first choice of orange and yellow, respectively; and the match between Netherlands and Spain in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group B|2014 FIFA World Cup]] where they wore dark blue and white (Spain's third choice colors) rather than their home colors of orange and red, respectively. During the [[1998-99 UEFA Champions League]], [[1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season|Manchester United F.C.]] had to wear their away colors in both of their group stage matches against [[F.C. Barcelona]], not just away at [[Camp Nou]] but also home at [[Old Trafford]] too.

===History in English football===
In England in 1890, [[English Football League|the Football League]], which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available.&lt;ref name="HFK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Articles/History.htm|title=A Brief History of Football Kit Design in England and Scotland|author=David Moor|accessdate=14 January 2008|publisher=HistoricalFootballKits.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118075657/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Articles/History.htm|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the home team was required to change colours in the event of a clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.&lt;ref name="Enc2"&gt;{{cite book

Host teams typically wear home colours for the duration of the tournament, for instance Germany played every game at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in its home white colours while the away colours (changed from black to red at the request of then-manager [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] in 2005) never made an appearance on the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/0,1518,398580,00.html |title=Traditionstrikot vor dem Aus&amp;nbsp;– Klinsmann steht auf Rot |language=German |author=Jürgen Zulu Tek, Thomas Niklaus / sid |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=1 February 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been some exceptions, however, as England wore their away red colours in the 1966 World Cup Final, while in 2018 Russia wore their away white colours against Uruguay and Spain.

===Major League Baseball===
{{see also|Baseball uniforms|Major League Baseball uniforms}}
Originally, Major League Baseball teams were primarily distinguished by the colours of their stockings. In 1882, the National League assigned different stocking colours to the member clubs; the league also assigned [[jersey (clothing)#In sports|jersey]] and cap colours, but by [[position player|player position]] rather than by club.

The Cincinnati Reds were known as the "Red Legs" and "Red Stockings" during the early 1900s.

[[File:Tampa Catholic High School baseball road uniform.jpg|thumb|The road uniform of [[Tampa Catholic High School]], [[Florida]]]]
By the end of the 19th century, it became common for teams to wear white at home, and grey in road games. Some teams used road uniforms of solid dark blue or black.&lt;ref name="baseball-almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/uniforms.shtml|title=Baseball Uniforms of the 20th Century by Baseball Almanac|publisher=[[Baseball Almanac]]|accessdate=2008-05-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509195105/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/uniforms.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of this is the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Superbas]], who started to use a blue pattern for their road uniforms in 1907.&lt;ref name="baseball-almanac"/&gt; Both the home and away teams' uniforms also contained trim in the team colours.

In 1916, on the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]]' road uniforms, purple lines gave their uniforms a [[tartan]]-like effect and another kind of road uniform was a solid dark blue or black material with white around this time. The [[Kansas City Athletics]] home and road uniforms were changed by [[Charles O. Finley]] in 1963, to the colours of gold and green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917734-7,00.html|title=Charlie Finley: Baseball's Barnum|publisher=Time|date=August 18, 1975|accessdate=2008-06-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012202104/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917734-7,00.html|archivedate=October 12, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teams used powder blue for their road uniforms from the 1970s to the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="baseball-almanac"/&gt;

Aside from the obvious need to distinguish one team from the other, conventional wisdom held that it was more difficult to properly launder uniforms while on a [[road (sports)|road]] trip, thus the "road grays" helped to hide accumulated soil. This convention continued well after its original premise was nullified by the issuance of multiple uniforms and the growth of the [[laundromat]] industry.

Typically, home uniforms feature the team's nickname, while away uniforms feature the name of the team's geographic designation; there are ten teams that are exceptions to this rules: the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], [[Los Angeles Angels]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Milwaukee Brewers]], [[Washington Nationals]], [[Miami Marlins]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/19249734/examining-teams-buck-mlb-home-road-uniform-trend|first=Paul|last=Lukas|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=April 28, 2017|language=English|title=Breaking down MLB's jersey name game|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428004429/http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/19249734/examining-teams-buck-mlb-home-road-uniform-trend|archivedate=April 28, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigers, Nationals and Yankees all wear their cap insignia on the left breast of their home jerseys, but the city name on their away jerseys.  

In addition to this, some teams have featured mainly their team's location presented on their uniforms both at home and on the road. Examples include the Rangers and Marlins, whose alternate orange jersey is the only one of the team's four to feature the nickname instead of the city name.  Some teams have alternate home uniforms featuring location such as the [[Colorado Rockies]] and St. Louis Cardinals. The Brewers have worn a navy jersey with "Milwaukee" on the front frequently both at home and on the road since 2015, while the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] have worn an alternate grey jersey with the nickname instead of the city name for most away games since 2014. 

From 1973 to 2008, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] were part of this group – the omission of the city's name being part of a largely successful effort to attract fans from the Washington, D.C. area – before returning "Baltimore" to the road jerseys in 2009, by which time their neighbour 35 miles (55&amp;nbsp;km) to the south once again had a team of its own.

Until the [[2017–18 NBA season|2017–18 season]], the rules of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) stated: "The home team shall wear light color jerseys, and the visitors dark jerseys unless otherwise approved.

But, according to this rule, road uniforms are required at every game in the NBA.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[college basketball]], the home team almost universally wears white uniforms, while the visiting team wears colours.

==Hockey==

===National Hockey League===
{{see also|NHL uniform}}
In the NHL each team is currently required to have two uniform designs: one with a white base (or sometimes historically, a light colour), and one with a darker-coloured base. From the 1970–71 season to the 2002–03 season, NHL teams wore lighter colours or white at home and the darker colours on the road. When the Third Jersey Program was introduced in the 1995–96 season, some teams wore third jerseys at home, thus requiring the road team to wear the white. This problem was rectified at the start of the 2003–04 season, as NHL teams started to wear the dark colour at home and the white for road games; there are occasional single-game exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coyotes.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=337397&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page Phoenix Coyotes 2007-08 "Reverse Jersey Nights"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315113028/http://coyotes.nhl.com/team/app?articleid=337397&amp;page=NewsPage&amp;service=page |date=March 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kings.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=31734 Los Angeles Kings Uniform History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512200754/http://kings.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&amp;page=NHLPage&amp;id=31734 |date=2009-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only element allowed by NHL rules to be interchangeable between the two uniforms is the pants.

In the minor leagues, teams historically wore white or light colours at home and dark colours on the road.

==Netball==
Away colours are used by [[Jamaica national netball team|Jamaica]] and [[Australia national netball team|Australia]], two top international teams who both have yellow home kits. Jamaica's change kit is all-black, Australia's is all-green. When the teams meet, one usually changes its kits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johannah Curran, Australia v Jamaica World|url=http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Johannah+Curran+Australia+v+Jamaica+World+GbJx9TJqFILl.jpg|website=Zimbio.com|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914070608/http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Johannah+Curran+Australia+v+Jamaica+World+GbJx9TJqFILl.jpg|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 World Netball Series – Day One – Verity Simmons, Sasha Lynch|url=http://isiphotos.photoshelter.com/image/I0000oH3ksK1myRE|website=ISI Photos|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914070710/http://isiphotos.photoshelter.com/image/I0000oH3ksK1myRE|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia through to gold medal match against New Zealand, August 3, 2014|url=http://netball.com.au/news/australia-through-to-gold-medal-match-against-new-zealand/|website=Netball.com.au|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317130413/http://netball.com.au/news/australia-through-to-gold-medal-match-against-new-zealand/|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there have been games such as a 2011 Test where each team wore predominantly yellow, with Jamaica in black skirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia v Jamaica Game One|url=http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Australia+v+Jamaica+Game+One+OI9WrIMm2nnl.jpg|website=Zimbio.com|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914075504/http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Australia+v+Jamaica+Game+One+OI9WrIMm2nnl.jpg|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby union==
It is traditional in rugby (as it was in soccer prior to 1921) for the home team to change in the event of a clash. This stems partly from teams touring overseas; it was easier for the home side to get an alternate kit. The [[World Rugby]] rules for tours do not state this outright: it is the responsibility of the WR CEO or representative "to resolve the matter", but "in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the Host Union shall be entitled to wear its home kit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRB Handbook Online|url=http://www.irb.com/imgml/IRB/irbhandbook/IRB_Handbook_Online_EN/index.html#/228/|accessdate=3 June 2014|ref=Page 230, regulation 15.18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606224804/http://www.irb.com/imgml/IRB/irbhandbook/IRB_Handbook_Online_EN/index.html#/228/|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] [[English rugby union system|level 3 to 5]] competition, if there is a clash the away team must change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFU Regulation 13.6.3: Kit, Clash of colours|url=http://www.rfu.com/~/media/files/thegame/regulations/rfu_regulation_13_2013|website=RFU.com|publisher=Rugby Football Union|accessdate=3 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011000448/http://www.rfu.com/~/media/files/thegame/regulations/rfu_regulation_13_2013|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Rugby World Cup]]s, colour clashes are decided by a [[coin-toss]] for first choice of kits. In the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] quarter-final between [[France national rugby union team|France]] and [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], the recently redesigned French kit was dark blue and black, and clashed with the All Blacks' kit.&lt;ref name="Frenchleave"/&gt; The toss went in favour of France, and New Zealand wore silver shirts in the game in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref name="Englandblackstuff"/&gt; However, in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup Final]] between those teams, France won the toss and chose to play in its white away kit. France's team manager [[Jo Maso]] said this decision was because of "the welcome they’d received from the people of New Zealand, the faultless organisation of the tournament and the honour and pleasure of playing... [at] [[Eden Park]]".&lt;ref name="Frenchleave"&gt;{{cite news|title=N. Zealand granted French leave for All Black final|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111018/rugby/N-Zealand-granted-French-leave-for-All-Black-final.389681|accessdate=1 August 2013|newspaper=Times of Malta|date=October 18, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120529/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20111018/rugby/N-Zealand-granted-French-leave-for-All-Black-final.389681|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[England national rugby union team|England]] used an all-black second kit at the [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011 World Cup]], which caused controversy in the host nation, as black is the home colour of [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Englandblackstuff"&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/5289989/England-go-all-black-for-Rugby-World-Cup "England go all black for Rugby World Cup"], [[Stuff.co.nz]], 15 July 2011. Retrieved 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; England wore the kit in one tournament match, against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]]. Critics in England in 2010 said the team was changing away kits unnecessarily and too often as a "marketing ploy".&lt;ref name="RFU defends"&gt;{{cite news|title=England v Australia: RFU defends use of grey away kit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/8128426/England-v-Australia-RFU-defends-use-of-grey-away-kit.html|accessdate=3 June 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926054711/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/england/8128426/England-v-Australia-RFU-defends-use-of-grey-away-kit.html|archivedate=26 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], on the other hand, has rarely worn an away kit except against [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wallabies to be all white at the World Cup?|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/timeline/rugby/story/139290.html|accessdate=3 June 2014|work=ESPNscrum|date=5 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607002953/http://www.espnscrum.com/timeline/rugby/story/139290.html|archivedate=7 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a white jersey would have been worn in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payten|first1=Iain|title=Wallabies all white for World Cup|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/wallabies-all-white-for-world-cup/story-e6frey4i-1226050161623|accessdate=3 June 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international rugby, the need for second kits arises most often in the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]], where Scotland, France and Italy all play in different shades of blue. The tournament takes the form of a single round-robin with home advantage alternating each year, and it is scheduled so that each of the three aforementioned sides plays one of the other two at home and the other away in a given season. In turn, this means that each of these three sides will play one home game in its alternate jersey. These have traditionally been white, but in the [[2015 Six Nations Championship|2015 Six Nations]] Scotland and France adopted red as their alternate colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Scotland alternate kit unveiled (24/09/14)|url=http://www.scottishrugby.org/news/14/09/24/new-scotland-alternate-kit-unveiled|website=ScottishRugby.org|publisher=Scottish Rugby|accessdate=23 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623051308/http://www.scottishrugby.org/news/14/09/24/new-scotland-alternate-kit-unveiled|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France rugby team to wear red against Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/31156290|accessdate=23 June 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=February 5, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311021359/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/31156290|archivedate=11 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's green jersey is complemented by two away jerseys, one which is white in colour and one which is navy in colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oneills.com/shop-by-team/gaa/international-rules.html | title=International Rules - GAA - Shop By Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These exercise trends are contributing to the rising rates of chronic diseases including: [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]] and [[high cholesterol]].&lt;ref name="CDC2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/physicalactivity/physicalactivity.htm|title=N C H S - Health E Stats -  Physical Activity Among Adults: United States, 2000 and 2005|work=CDC|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active transport (walking, bicycling, etc.) has been found to be inversely related to obesity in Europe, North America, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bassett DR, Pucher J, Buehler R, Thompson DL, Crouter SE|title=Walking, cycling, and obesity rates in Europe, North America, and Australia|journal=J Phys Act Health|volume=5|issue=6|pages=795–814|date=November 2008|pmid=19164816|doi=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus exercise has been associated with a decrease in mortality.&lt;ref name=CDC2007/&gt;

==Causes of lack of exercise==
{{See also|Sedentary lifestyle|Lack of physical education}}
One of the causes most prevalent in the developing world is urbanization.  As more of the population moves to cities, population over-crowding, increased poverty, increased levels of crime, high-density traffic, low air quality and lack of parks, sidewalks and recreational sports facilities leads to a less active lifestyle.&lt;ref name=WHOX/&gt;

Physical inactivity is increasing or high among many groups in the population including: young people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_young_people/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Young People|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_women/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Women|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_olderadults/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Physical Activity and Older Adults|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 population study in south Brazil showed physical inactivity during leisure time to be more prevalent among females and those living with a partner; with a positive correlation associated with age and number of cigarettes smoked, and a negative correlation (decreased levels of physical inactivity) associated with years of formal education, body mass index, and increasing socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name=Brazil2005/&gt;

Studies in children and adults have found an association between the number of hours of television watched and the [[prevalence]] of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gortmaker SL, Must A, Sobol AM, Peterson K, Colditz GA, Dietz WH|title=Television viewing as a cause of increasing obesity among children in the United States, 1986–1990|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med|volume=150|issue=4|pages=356–62|date=April 1996|pmid=8634729|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170290022003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vioque J, Torres A, Quiles J|title=Time spent watching television, sleep duration and obesity in adults living in Valencia, Spain|journal=Int.

Emanuel|accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noncommunicable diseases]], partly due to a lack of exercise, are currently the greatest [[public health]] problem in most countries around the world.&lt;ref name=WHOX/&gt;  Each year at least 1.9 million people die as a result of physical inactivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/moveforhealth/en/|title=WHO &amp;#124; Why "Move for Health"|work=WHO|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which makes inactivity one of the leading [[preventable causes of death]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ|title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data|journal=Lancet|volume=367|issue=9524|pages=1747–57|date=May 2006|pmid=16731270|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==

===Australia===
Australian children between 1961 and 2002 have had a marked decline in their aerobic fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomkinson GR, Olds TS|title=Secular changes in aerobic fitness test performance of Australasian children and adolescents|journal=Med Sport Sci|volume=50|issue=|pages=168–82|year=2007|pmid=17387257|doi=10.1159/0000101361|url=|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Obese people are less active than their normal weight counterparts.

National data indicates that only 10% of Canadian youth are meeting the guideline for screen time of less than 2 hours per day.  As well, although 2/3 of families live close enough for their children to bike or walk to school, only 1/3 report actually walking to school and 80% report never having cycled to school.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Asia and China===

A rapid decline in physical activity has occurred between the 1980s and the 2000s.  The decline in physical activity is attributed to increasing technology in the workplace and changing leisure activities.&lt;ref name="FAOChina"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0442e/a0442e06.htm|title=The double burden of malnutrition Case studies from six developing countries|work=Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 65% of Chinese had jobs that required heavy labor.

===Netherlands===
As of 2007 [[walking]] and [[cycling]] as a means of transport In the [[Netherlands]] has been stable since 1994. The average Dutch citizen in the year 2007 walked {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} and cycled {{convert|908|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=37338&amp;D1=2&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=6-7&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=a&amp;HDR=G1,T,G4,G2&amp;STB=G3,G5&amp;VW=T|title=statline.cbs.nl|work=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek|accessdate=Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CrossFit has been a trend in The Netherlands since 2012. It is a unique training program that combines a [[physical exercise]] philosophy and a competitive fitness sport.  '''CrossFit''' workouts use elements from [[high-intensity interval training]], [[Olympic weightlifting]], [[plyometrics]], [[powerlifting]], [[gymnastics]] and other exercises. It is very successful around the world and has 13,000 members in affiliated [[Gym|gyms]].

Personal training is gaining more and more popularity in the Netherlands in the last 15 years. A '''personal trainer''' is a trainer certified to have a varying degree of knowledge of general fitness involved in [[exercise prescription]] and instruction. They motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback to clients. 

Obstacle training centrums are very popular in The Netherlands since companies like [[:nl:Unitedfit|UNITEDFIT]] have included the social aspect to training for an obstacle course. An '''obstacle course''' is a series of challenging physical obstacles an individual or a team need to complete while being timed. Obstacle courses can include [[running]], [[climbing]], [[jumping]], [[Crawling (human)|crawling]], [[Human swimming|swimming]], and [[Balance (ability)|balancing]] elements with the aim of testing speed and endurance. Sometimes a course involves [[Mind|mental]] tests.

==Summary==
The definition of an extreme sport is not exact and the origin of the term is unclear, but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by [[marketing]] companies to promote the [[X Games]] and when the [[Extreme Sports Channel]] and the Extreme Sports Company launched. More recently, the commonly used definition from research is  "a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome" by Dr. Rhonda Cohen (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/view/creators/Cohen=3ARhonda=3A=3A.html The relationship between personality, sensation seeking, reaction time and sport participation: evidence from drag racers, sport science students and archers].

While use of the term "extreme sport" has spread everywhere to describe a multitude of different activities, exactly which sports are considered 'extreme' is debatable. There are, however, several characteristics common to most extreme sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-athletes-told-me.html|title=What the Athletes Told Me|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not the exclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average target demographic. Extreme sports are rarely sanctioned by schools.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Extreme sports tend to be more solitary than traditional sports&lt;ref name="americansportsdata.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |title='Generation Y' drives increasingly popular... |date=August 1, 2002 |publisher=AmericanSportsData.com |accessdate=2008-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162957/http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (rafting and paintballing are notable exceptions, as they are done in teams). In addition, beginning extreme athletes tend to work on their craft without the guidance of a coach (though some may hire a coach later).

Activities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional [[sport]]s due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.

In a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. While it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as X Games, there are environmental variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions for [[snowboard]]ers, rock and ice quality for [[climbing|climbers]], and wave height and shape for [[surfing|surfers]].

Whilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Jungmin Lee (2004), [https://ideas.repec.org/p/ecm/nasm04/122.html Extreme Sports Evaluation: Evidence from Judging Figure Skating, Econometric Society]&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own ideals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/19/DI2006061900992.html|title='Adrenaline': Extreme Sports|accessdate=2008-07-11 | work=The Washington Post | first1=Jon | last1=Wile | first2=Sonny | last2=Amato | date=2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments in the sports.

==Classification==
While the exact definition and what is included as extreme sport is debatable, some attempted to make classification for extreme sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlinson, Joe |title=Extreme Sports: In Search of the Ultimate Thrill |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |location=Hove |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-55297-992-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument is that to qualify as an "extreme sport" '''both''' expression terms need to be fulfilled;
* "'''sport'''": The participant has to dispose of considerable skill and/or physical ability to avoid ''poor execution of the activity'';
* "'''extreme'''": ''poor execution of the activity'' has to result in considerable risk of serious physical harm to the participant;

Along this definition, an activity such as [[bungee jumping]] may not qualify as no skill or physical ability is required to execute a good jump (i.e., avoid poor execution). A passenger in a canyon [[jet boat]] ride will not fulfill the requirements, as the skill required pertains to the pilot, not the passengers. "[[Thrill seeking]]" might in these cases be a more suitable qualification than "extreme sport".{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Extreme sports may be subdivided into:

===Extreme vehicle sports===

These sports require the use of  snow, ice or water sports ("sports de glisse" in French) and '''rolling''' sports. Another subdivision can be made along '''motorized''' and '''non motorized''' vehicle sports, resulting in the following matrix;{{cn|date=July 2018}}

== History ==

[[File:ExtremeSports3.png|right|thumb|upright=2]]

The origin of the divergence of the term "extreme sports" from "sports" may date to the 1950s in the appearance of a phrase usually, but wrongly, attributed to [[Ernest Hemingway]].&lt;ref name="Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timelesshemingway.com/content/quotationsfaq#threesports |title=Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203013838/http://www.timelesshemingway.com/content/quotationsfaq |archivedate=February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The implication of the phrase was that the word "sport" defined an activity in which one might be killed. The other activities being termed "games". The phrase may have been invented by either writer [[Barnaby Conrad]] or automotive author [[Ken Purdy]].&lt;ref name="Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5"/&gt;

The [[Dangerous Sports Club]] of [[Oxford University]], [[England]] was founded by [[David Kirke (bungee jumper)|David Kirke]], Chris Baker, Ed Hulton and [[Alan Weston]]. They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day [[bungee jumping]], by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], [[Bristol, England]]. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the [[Royal Gorge]] Suspension Bridge in [[Colorado]], sponsored by and televised on the popular [[United States|American]] television program ''[[That's Incredible!]]'' [[Bungee jumping]] was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers.
The Club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London [[double-decker bus]], wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers refused.

Other Club activities included expedition [[hang gliding]] from active [[volcano]]es; the launching of giant (60&amp;nbsp;ft) plastic spheres with pilots suspended in the centre ([[zorbing]]); [[microlight]] flying; and [[BASE jumping]] (in the early days of this sport).

In recent decades the term ''extreme sport'' was further promoted after the [[Extreme Sports Channel]], Extreme.com launched and then the X Games, a multi-sport event was created and developed by [[ESPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |title=extreme sports |year=2007 |publisher=[[Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023120444/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15836448.html |title=Generation Ex – the Extreme Games, a competition for people with exceptional athletic talents |year=1994 |author=Josh Krulewitz |work=American Fitness |via=[[HighBeam]]|subscription=yes |accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first X Games (known as 1995 Extreme Games) were held in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Mount Snow]], and [[Vermont]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |title=Extreme Sports – Encarta |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwc2bMeg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutXGames&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |title=About International X Games |year=2002 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829202819/http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. For example, [[windsurfing]] was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a [[surfing|surfboard]] with a [[Sailing|sailing boat's]] propulsion system (mast and sail). [[Kitesurfing]] on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of [[kite buggying]] (a [[parafoil]]) with the bi-directional boards used for [[wakeboarding]]. [[Wakeboarding]] is in turn derived from [[snowboarding]] and [[waterskiing]].

== Marketing ==
[[File:Hanggliding03042006.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hang glider]] launching from [[Mount Tamalpais]]]]
Some contend&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5DD133DF93BA35751C0A96E958260 "Extreme Sport, Extreme Chic, Extreme Hype"], ''New York Times'', February 8, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated. For example, rugby union is both dangerous and adrenaline-inducing but is not considered an extreme sport due to its traditional image, and because it does not involve high speed or an intention to perform [[stunt]]s (the aesthetic criteria mentioned above) and also it does not have changing environmental variables for the athletes.

== Motivation ==
[[File:Snowboarder cornice at sugarbowl.jpg|right|thumb|Snowboarder drops off a cornice.]]
A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce an [[adrenaline]] rush in participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |date=August 1, 2002 |title='Generation Y' Drives Increasingly Popular... |publisher=AmericanSportsData.com |accessdate=2008-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162957/http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the medical view is that the rush or high associated with the activity is not due to adrenaline being released as a response to fear, but due to increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[endorphin]]s and [[serotonin]] because of the high level of physical exertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konkel|first1=Lindsey|title=Extreme Psychology|url=http://scienceline.org/2009/07/health-konkel-extreme-sports-risk-psychology/|website=ScienceLine.org|publisher=New York University|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a recent study suggests that the link to adrenaline and 'true' extreme sports is tentative.&lt;ref&gt;Brymer, Eric and Gray, Tonia, ''Extreme Sports: A Challenge to Phenomenology''. University of Wollongong, Australia, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The study defined 'true' extreme sports as a leisure or recreation activity where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident or mistake was death. This definition was designed to separate the marketing hype from the activity.

Eric Brymer&lt;ref&gt;Brymer, Eric, ''Extreme Dude: A Phenomenological Perspective on the Extreme sports experience ''. University of Wollongong, Australia, 2005 {{cite web|url=http://www.library.uow.edu.au/adt-NWU/public/adt-NWU20060508.145406/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721115425/http://www.library.uow.edu.au/adt-NWU/public/adt-NWU20060508.145406/index.html |archivedate=2008-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also found that the potential of various extraordinary human experiences, many of which parallel those found in activities such as meditation, was an important part of the extreme sport experience. Those experiences put the participants outside their [[comfort zone]] and are often done in conjunction with [[adventure travel]].

Some of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some going on to become well known personalities. Rock climbing and [[ice climbing]] have spawned publicly recognizable names such as [[Edmund Hillary]], [[Chris Bonington]], [[Wolfgang Güllich]] and more recently [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]. Another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the inhabitants of [[Hawaii]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Mortality==
[[File:Wingsuit-01.jpg|thumb|[[Wingsuit flying]] is a recent activity.]]
Extreme sports by their nature can be extremely dangerous, conducive to fatalities, near-fatalities and other serious injuries, and sometimes consist in treading along the brink of death. This imminent and inherent danger in these sports has been considered a somewhat necessary part of its appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://articles.philly.com/2013-02-03/sports/36723401_1_extreme-sports-snowmobile-backflip |title = In extreme sports, the X-factor is death |last = Smallwood |first = John |accessdate= 11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is partially a result of pressure for athletes to make more money and provide maximum entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://money.msn.com/now/post.aspx?post=1ef3fc34-dc7b-4421-974f-d3b7b37e8006 |title = Recent deaths draw attention to extreme sports |last = Kennedy |first = Bruce |accessdate= 11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disabled community==
Disabled people participate in extreme sports. Nonprofit organizations such as Adaptive Action Sports seek to increase awareness of the participation in action sports by members of the disabled community, as well as increase access to the adaptive technologies that make participation possible and to competitions such as The X Games.{{Advert inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Adaptive-Sports.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Adaptive Action Sports - Amy Purdy"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/x-games.html|title=''Ability Magazine: X Games - Adaptive Sports"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
Extreme sports is a sub-category of sports than are described as any kind of sport "of a character or kind farthest removed from the ordinary or average".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/14931/|title = A Phenomenological Investigation of the Experience of Taking Part in 'Extreme Sports'|last = Willig|first = Carla|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|doi = 10.1177/1359105307082459|pmid = |access-date =|volume=13|pages=690–702}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of sports often carry out the potential risk of serious and permanent physical injury and even death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/55275/|title = Extreme sports are good for your health: A phenomenological understanding of fear and anxiety in extreme sport.|author1=Brymer, E. |author2= Schweitzer, R. |last-author-amp=yes |date = 2013 |origyear=2012|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|doi = 10.1177/1359105312446770|pmid = |access-date = |volume=18 |pages=477–487}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these sports also have the potential to produce drastic benefits on mental and physical health.

Health is an individual's state of mental and physical well-being in which they are maximising their daily potential. It is divided into two main categories: mental and physical.

Mental health is a cognitive state of well-being, in this state the individual is aware of his or how own potential and is able to; cope with stresses of normal life and work productively, as well as willing to give their contribution to his or her community in a beneficial way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/en/|title = Mental Health|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical health can be defined as a state of complete physical well-being in which an individual is mechanically fit to perform their daily activities and duties without any problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/social_care_and_health/health_advice/physical_health.aspx|title = Physical Health|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme sports trigger the release of the hormone adrenaline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = X-games: Are you equipped for the extreme? (high-risk sports).|last = Globus|first = S|date = 1997|journal = Current Health 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very powerful hormone as it can cause human beings to perform tremendous stunts of many sorts. However, with a bad mix of other hormones it can lead people to execute terrible actions. It is believed that the implementation of extreme sports on mental health patients improves their perspective and recognition of aspects of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In various sports, a '''forfeit''' is a method in which a match automatically ends and the forfeiting team loses.

There are two distinct forms of forfeiture. One occurs when a team is unable to meet the basic standards for playing the game, either before the game begins or as a result of actions that happen during the match. In such a case, the team not forfeiting wins the match. The other is ''punitive forfeiture'', in which a team has been found to have broken the rules of a sanctioning body during a match they have won and must have the results stricken from the record; whether or not the other team receives a win in such a case depends on the rules of that body.

== Association football ==
Both teams must have at least seven players at the beginning of the match per the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. When a team has fewer than seven players, the match cannot start or continue.&lt;ref&gt;[[IFAB]]: [http://www.theifab.com/#!/laws/the-players/chapters/number-of-players ''Laws of the Game 2016/2017''], Law 3&lt;/ref&gt; When the number of players in a team falls definitely below seven (e.g. by five players sent off with [[penalty card#Red card|red cards]], or by injured players with no substitutions left, or a combination of both), the match is forfeited. Forfeits are also used as ''ex post'' disciplinary sanctions by governing bodies.

A forfeited match is handled differently in various competitions; FIFA Disciplinary Code punishes the team sanctioned with a forfeit with a 3–0 loss (but the result on the pitch is upheld if the goal difference at the end of the match was greater than three).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/50/02/75/discoinhalte.pdf|title = FIFA Disciplinary Code|last =|first =|date = 2011|website = FIFA|publisher =|page = 21|access-date = 2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baseball ==
{{Main|Forfeit (baseball)}}
In rare cases, [[baseball]] games are forfeited, usually in the event when a team is no longer able to play.

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}

== Basketball ==
In [[basketball]] rules published by FIBA, a forfeit and default are two different things. A team will forfeit if:
* Fifteen minutes after the scheduled starting time, the team is not present or is unable to field five players ready to play.
* Its actions prevent the game from being played.
* It refuses to play after being instructed to do so by the referee.
A forfeit results in loss for the offending team, a score of 20−0, and in tournaments that use the [[FIBA]] points system for standings, 0 points. Furthermore, in FIBA tournaments that use a two-game home-and-away series ([[two-legged tie]]) or a [[best-of-three playoff]] format, a team that forfeits any of the games loses the series by forfeit.

In FIBA tournaments, a forfeit is different from a default, a situation if during the game, the team has fewer than two players (e.g. one or zero players) on the playing court ready to play with no replacements on the bench remaining. In this case, the opponents are awarded with a win, and if they are leading, the score at the time of stoppage will be the final score; if they are not leading, they are awarded with a 2−0 win. Furthermore, in FIBA tournaments that use a two-game home-and-away series, a team that defaults in either game loses the series by default.

In tournaments and leagues that use [[winning percentage]] to rank teams, the difference between a forfeit and a default is negligible; however, for those that use the FIBA points system, a default is treated like an ordinary loss, as the team earns one point. Meanwhile, a team that forfeited earns no points. It is also more detrimental in tiebreaking situations as a defaulting team's worst result is the actual score if they were trailing when the game was stopped, or a 2–0 loss if they were trailing. A forfeit costs a 0–20 loss, and drags down a team's [[goal average]] worse than a 0–2 loss would.

In U.S. [[NCAA]] basketball, a referee decides a game is to be forfeited when any of these criteria are satisfied:
* Any player, squad member or bench personnel fails to comply with any technical-foul penalty or makes a travesty of the game.
* When conditions warrant.
* A team refuses to play after being instructed to do so by an official.
The forfeiting team loses the game 2−0, unless 30 minutes have lapsed in the game clock; in this case, the score at the end of play shall stand. When the team that is behind in the scorebook is to be declared the winning team, that score shall be marked with an asterisk in the official statistics; and it shall be noted that the game was won by forfeit.

The rules of the [[National Basketball Association]] do not mention how forfeitures are dealt with, but mention it is a possible sanction on a player or coach who violates the rules on [[ejection (sports)|ejections]]. Also, in the NBA, defaulting is virtually impossible, unless ejections bring a team to fewer than five players.  When five players remain in a game, and one fouls out, a technical foul is called when a player who has fouled out is forced to remain in the game, or when, after an injury, a player who fouled out of the game previously returns to the game. These technical fouls are declared non-unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, for which no player or coach may be ejected.

== Chess ==
As well as [[checkmate]], [[chess]] games can be [[Rules_of_chess#Resigning|resigned]] or lost on [[Time control|time]], but the term "forfeit" generally has a narrower meaning in the game.

A forfeit occurs when a player does not appear at the match, and is generally a rare occurrence. A notable instance of forfeiture happened in the [[World_Chess_Championship_1972#Game_2:_Fischer_forfeits|second game]] of the [[World_Chess_Championship_1972|1972 World Chess Championship]]. [[Bobby Fisher]], due to disputes over the organisation of the match, refused to show, and the game was recorded as a win for his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bobby Fischer Forfeits Second Chess Game {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1972/7/14/bobby-fischer-forfeits-second-chess-game/ |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=The Harvard Crimson |date=14 July 1972 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, a player caught [[cheating in chess|cheating]] will lose by forfeit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=FIDE/ACP Anti-Cheating Committee |title=Anti-Cheating Guidelines |url=https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/Anti%20Cheating%20Guidelines.pdf |accessdate=23 August 2018 |pages=13 |date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cricket ==
{{Main|Declaration and forfeiture}}
In the sport of [[cricket]] a forfeiture occurs when a captain chooses to forfeit one of his side’s innings.

==Gaelic games==

In the [[Gaelic games]] of [[hurling]], [[Gaelic football]], [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]], a forfeit is called a ''walkover'' ({{Lang-ga|bua gan choimhlint}}). As well as losing the game, the team that gives a walkover in a competition may receive further punishment, such as a fine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leitrimobserver.ie/news/sport/227792/board-to-investigate-increasing-fines-for-clubs-failing-to-field-teams-in-the-league.html|title=Board to investigate increasing fines for clubs failing to field teams in the League|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://meath.gaa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rialach%C3%A1in-2016_Regulations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; deduction of league points or automatic [[relegation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.celbridgegaa.com/gaa/images/pdf/2016-d/Football-League-Rules-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous walkover in [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] history came in the [[1910 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]]; the match was scratched and Louth were awarded the championship as Kerry refused to travel to [[Dublin]] for the final because the [[Great Southern and Western Railway]] would not grant fans, players and officials discounted fares for the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terracetalk.com/articles/Memories/103/The-Kerry-Footballers-Strike-of-1910|title=The Kerry Footballers Strike of 1910|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/news/home/250281/historic-louth-all-ireland-winning-medals-set-to-go-under-the-hammer.html|title=Historic Louth All Ireland-winning medals set to go under the hammer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gridiron football ==
In [[American football]], a team must begin with at least eleven people ready to play; a forfeiture occurs if a team does not have that many. It can also occur when the number of able players drops to below seven (the number legally required to man a [[line of scrimmage]]) at any point during game time, as a result of an [[palpably unfair act|unfair act]], or punitive retroactive sanctions against a team from a governing body such as the [[NCAA]].

In the event the team forfeiting the game is already losing at the time of the forfeit, the score at the time stands as is. Otherwise, forfeits result in a 2-0 score in the [[National Football League]] or a 1-0 score in [[high school football]], [[NCAA]] and [[Canadian football]]. 

In the case of high school and the NCAA, the forfeit is one of only two ways to finish with a score of only one point (the other is if a team's only score comes from a botched [[conversion (gridiron football)|conversion attempt]] that results in their opponent getting backed all the way back into their own end zone).

The [[National Football League]] rulebook has a provision for forfeiture but has never used it (there was at least one alleged "forfeit" in the [[1921 NFL season]], but because league schedules were so fluid in the 1920s and it was never clear who was at fault for the game not being played, the league now considers it a cancellation, which was very common at the time). Former NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] noted that he had never used the league's forfeit provisions and would never change the result of a game after the fact, a stance that prevented the result of the [[Snowplow Game]], a game that had been decided on an acknowledged but unpunished unfair act, from being forfeited. It was briefly discussed as a potential punishment during [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|Spygate]] but never implemented. 

The NCAA also uses punitive forfeiture in other sports. The [[Arena Football League]] has had one forfeit in its history, which came in [[2012 Arena Football League season|2012]] as a result of a player's strike. In another case in [[2015 Arena Football League season|2015]], two teams ceased operations prior to the end of the season, and because they were both slated to play each other, the game was recorded as a scoreless tie.

A related concept is the ''vacation'', in which the team's wins are stricken from the record, but no loss is put in its place, and a team that lost in a game where the win was later vacated is still counted as a loss. The NCAA bylaws allow wins to be vacated as a form of punishment; the NFL does not.

== Poker ==
In cases where a poker game is arranged but an opponent drops out, that person forfeits and remaining players win at that player's expense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3189">[[File:Frog jumping contest 1.jpg|thumb|Calaveras County Fair and Jumping Frog Jubilee 2016]]
'''Frog jumping''' is a competitive pastime for humans in which [[frog]]s are entered into competitions to [[jumping|jump]] certain distances. Frog jumping contests are held in small communities scattered around the [[United States]], as part of the folk culture.

Frog jumping was made famous in a [[short story]] by [[Mark Twain]], "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]." An event, inspired by the Twain story, has been held annually in [[Angels Camp, California|Angels Camp]], in California's [[Calaveras County]], since 1928, with other events held in Indiana, Ohio, Washington, Maine, Missouri, Louisiana, New York, and also in Manitoba, Canada.

With 4,000 contestants in 2007, the Calaveras County contest has imposed strict rules regulating the frogs's welfare, including limiting the daily number of a frog's jumps and mandating the playing of calming music in their enclosures. Entering specimens of the  [[California Red-legged Frog]] in the competition, since it is an endangered species, is illegal. (It is also illegal, and likewise considered poor sportsmanship, for any competing frog to be weighted down by any means, as the frog in the Twain story was by the stranger who cheated in the contest as described.) Participants entering the longest-jumping frog were to win a $750 prize, or $5,000 if their frog were to break the 1986 record of 21 feet, 5¾ inches, set by "Rosie the Ribeter."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7068">{{Update|NFL’s IR rules|date=December 2017}}
The '''injured reserve list''' ({{abbr|abbr.|abbreviated}} '''IR list''') is an official designation used by the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for [[Sportsperson|athletes]] who become [[sports injury|injured]] and temporarily unable to play. It is analogous to the '''injured list''' in the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) or the [[disabled list]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). The [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) does not have a direct analog to an injured reserve list, instead using a more general-purpose "inactive list" that does not require a player to be injured.

It is used because the rules of these leagues allow for only a certain numbers of players on each team's [[Schedule (workplace)|roster]]. Designating a player as "Injured/Reserve" frees up a roster spot, enabling the team to add a new replacement player during the injured athlete's convalescence. In the NFL, when a player is placed on the injured reserve list he cannot return to play for the remainder of the regular season even if fully fit; the other leagues allow the player to return to play during the season.

==NHL rules==
A player may be placed on injured reserve if he is unable to participate due to illness or injury, provided that the player had passed the club's initial physical examination at the start of the season. To qualify for the IR due to injury, that injury must be sufficient (in the opinion of the team's medical staff) to render the player unable to participate for the seven days following that injury. Once placed on IR, the team may then replace the player on their roster. The player on IR may not return to active play for seven days, although they may participate in non-competitive events such as practice, meetings, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26377#injured|title=NHL Headquarters|publisher=[[nhl.com]]|accessdate=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFL rules==
A team may place a player on injured reserve (reserve/injured list) who is "not immediately available for participation with a club". Generally, these players may not practice or return to the Active List for the rest of the season (including postseason games or the Pro Bowl) in which they are placed on injured reserve, but are allowed to be with the team.&lt;ref&gt;2009 NFL Record and Fact Book, p. 32 {{ISBN|1-60320-809-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[National Football League preseason|preseason]], the league also allows players with long-term, but not season-ending, injuries to be placed into one of two designations: [[physically unable to perform]] (PUP), for injuries sustained during the previous season or during offseason training activities (a player who passes their physical at the beginning of training camp and practices is physically able to participate and is thus ineligible for the PUP list), or reserve/non-football injury, for injuries sustained outside of team or league activities (despite the name, this includes lingering injuries from [[college football]] play, should an injured player be drafted and join the team). Both designations are functionally identical in that the player can be promoted to the active roster by week 6 of the regular season or placed on injured reserve. During the regular season, players on the PUP list and injured reserve do not count against the league's 53 man roster maximum, but do count against the 90 man roster limit (also includes practice squad players). 

Starting in 2012, the NFL and the NFLPA reached an agreement allowing one player placed on injured reserve to be brought back to the active roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000056497/article/nflpa-nfl-agree-to-trade-deadline-extension-ir-exception | title=NFLPA, NFL agree to trade deadline extension, IR exception | publisher=[[NFL]] | date=2012-08-30 | accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the player was on the final 53-man preseason roster (A rule exempted for the 2012 season), and that the injury is deemed to keep this  player unable to practice or play football for an estimated six weeks, the player may be allowed to practice after Week 6, and be activated to play after Week 8.&lt;ref&gt;http://wcfcourier.com/sports/football/nfl-changes-rule-for-players-on-ir/article_19dcb07c-f329-11e1-ba45-0019bb2963f4.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, teams may now return two players from injured reserve after Week 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=D'Andrea|first1=Christian|title=NFL approves rule to allow 2 players to return from injured reserve|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2017/5/23/15654976/nfl-officials-approve-rule-allow-2-players-to-return-injured-reserve-per-season|agency=SB Nation|date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams may also place a player on injured reserve with a minor injury designation, but the team must release the player once he is healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gehlken |first=Michael |title=Nate Kaeding passes physical, no longer a Charger |date=October 30, 2012 |newspaper=U-T San Diego |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/oct/30/nate-kaeding-passes-physical-be-waived/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bon8mRbb?url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/oct/30/nate-kaeding-passes-physical-be-waived/ |archivedate=October 31, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|NBA}}NBA rules==
{{Main|NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement}}

Due to abuses in the use of the injured reserve list, where some teams found it convenient to use the IR to stash players without independent medical oversight, the injured reserve has been renamed the Inactive List with the last [[collective agreement|collective bargaining agreement]]. Starting in the {{NBA Year|2005|app=season}}, players can enter the inactive list one hour before tip-off for as little as one game. The inactive list has a minimum of one player and a maximum of three, subject to hardship rules when a team with three injured players already on its inactive list has a fourth player injured. Players sent to the [[NBA G League]] will continue to count on a team's inactive list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235409e.pdf |title= International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport | date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[rights-based]] document which was adopted by member states of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), on November 18, 2015 during the 38th session of the UNESCO General Conference. This document is the legitimate successor of the '''International Charter of Physical Education and Sport''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13150&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=International Charter of Physical Education and Sport | date=21 November 1978 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  originally adopted in 1978, during the 20th General Conference of UNESCO.

The original Charter, which was amended in 1991, was the first rights-based document to state that '''“the practice of physical education and sport is a fundamental right for all”'''.
Based on the universal spirit of the original Charter (1978), and integrating the significant evolutions in the field of sport over the last 37 years, the revised Sport Charter highlights the health benefits of physical activity, the inclusion of persons with disabilities, the protection of children, the role of sport for development and peace, as well as the need to protect the integrity of sport from doping, violence, manipulation and corruption.

== Objectives ==

In twelve brief articles, the revised Charter serves as a universal reference on the ethical and quality standards of physical education, physical activity and sport. While preserving the initial intention of the 1978 Charter, this new document also represents a renewed commitment of the international sports community to actively promote sport as a catalyst for peace and development.

The revised version of the Sport Charter provides a framework that orients the protection of the integrity of sport and supports broader policies in favour of grassroots sport. It also recognizes physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.

UNESCO Director-General, [[Irina Bokova]] said: “The adoption of the revised Charter should mark a shift away from words towards action, from policy intent to implementation. It sets the tone for a new international sport policy debate, which should now focus on the exchange of good practice, education and training programmes, capacity development, and advocacy. This is also a strong recognition of physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/international_charter_of_physical_education_revised_to_ensure_more_inclusive_access_to_physical_activity/#.VlL51tHlvs0 |title= Press release issued by UNESCO to announce the adoption of the Sport Charter | date=18 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authors of the Revision ==
The revision of the Charter involved experts and practitioners from governments, sports organizations, academia and NGOs. This new version was carefully examined through sessions of the '''Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS)''' and its '''Permanent Consultative Council (PCC'''), as well as UNESCO’s '''Executive Board'''. It is a follow-up to the '''Declaration of Berlin'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/physical-education-and-sport/mineps-2013/declaration/|title= Declaration of Berlin| date=30 May 2013 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was adopted by 600 participants from 121 countries, as an outcome of the '''5th World Conference of Sport Ministers (MINEPS V)'''.

A '''jersey''' is an item of [[knit]]ted [[clothing]], traditionally in [[wool]] or [[cotton]], with [[sleeve]]s, worn as a [[Sweater|pullover]], as it does not open at the front, unlike a [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]. It is acommonly worn by sports teams as part of the team uniform, in team colors, often with a required number and optionally the player's name on the back. It is usually close-fitting and machine knitted in contrast to a [[guernsey (clothing)|guernsey]] that is more often hand knit with a thicker [[yarn]]. The word is usually used interchangeably with [[sweater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0040517507078023|title=Studies on the Influence of Knit Structure and Stitch Length on Ring and Compact Yarn Single Jersey Fabric Properties|first1=C.D.|last1=Kane|first2=U.J.|last2=Patil|first3=P.|last3=Sudhakar|date=1 August 2007|publisher=|journal=Textile Research Journal|volume=77|issue=8|pages=572–582|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0040517507078023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a jersey as used in [[sport]] is a [[shirt]] worn by a member of a team, typically depicting the [[sportsperson|athlete]]'s name and team number as well as the [[logotype]] of the team or corporate sponsor. [[Cycling jersey]]s of specific color or pattern represent certain statuses in [[cycling]], such as the yellow jersey of the leader of the [[general classification in the Tour de France]], or the [[rainbow jersey]] for the world champion.  Cycling jerseys are usually made of synthetic [[microfiber]] material to aid in wicking sweat away from the skin to allow it to [[evaporate]].  The main garment of an [[ice hockey]] uniform, which was traditionally called a sweater, is increasingly known as a [[hockey jersey]]. This garment, along with [[basketball]] jerseys which are usually [[sleeveless]] and [[baseball]] jerseys which are usually button up, have become fashion accessories. A related term is "[[Bib (garment)|bib]]", which may refer to a shirt (jersey, esp. in Britain{{citation needed|reason=Lived here all my life, never once heard anyone use bib to mean shirt/jersey|date=February 2018}}). In [[Australian rules football]], the player's shirt is known as a "[[guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/004051755502500314|title=An Engineering Approach to Jersey Fabric Construction|first=W.E.|last=Shinn|date=1 March 1955|publisher=|journal=Textile Research Journal|volume=25|issue=3|pages=270–277|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/004051755502500314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hemdvoorhem.nl/|title=Hemdvoorhem.nl - Gratis verzending en 100 dagen gratis retour|website=www.hemdvoorhem.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sports, such as [[ice hockey]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and various [[football]] codes, a player's jersey may be "[[retired number#See also|retired]]".  When a jersey is retired that player's jersey is placed usually where the team plays in honor of that player's accomplishment.  Generally, when a jersey is retired, the [[Number (sports)|number]] on the player's jersey is made unavailable for future players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jaCjAgAAQBAJ|title=Textiles in Sport|first=Roshan|last=Shishoo|date=29 August 2005|publisher=Elsevier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of major '''sports [[scandal]]s'''.

== American football scandals ==
* [[Minnesota Vikings boat party scandal]] (2005) – a pleasure cruise that reportedly featured sexual shenanigans by several members of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL)
* [[National Football League player conduct controversy]] (2007–present) – various off the field incidents involving [[American football]] athletes from the NFL, including [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam "Pacman" Jones]], [[Tank Johnson|Terry "Tank" Johnson]], [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]], [[Ray Rice]] and [[Adrian Peterson]], who earned suspensions as a result.
* [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]] (2007) – the [[New England Patriots]] were disciplined for videotaping the opposing team's coach's signals. Coach [[Bill Belichick]] was fined $500,000 and the New England Patriots were fined $250,000 and lost their [[2008 NFL Draft|2008 1st round draft pick]].
* [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal]] (2012) – the NFL discovered that the [[New Orleans Saints]] had operated a secret slush fund from [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009]] to [[2011 New Orleans Saints season|2011]] that paid "bounties" to defensive players for big plays during games, most controversially for injuring opponents. The scheme was allegedly organized by a number of players plus defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]], with the acquiescence of head coach [[Sean Payton]]. Shortly after the investigation came to light, Williams was accused of running similar schemes while he was defensive coordinator of the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans]] and [[Washington Redskins]], as well as the head coach of the [[Buffalo Bills]]. The league suspended Williams indefinitely and Payton for one year and suspended the Saints' general manager and another assistant for parts of the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]. [[Jonathan Vilma]], a Saints player who had a major role in the scheme and reportedly offered a $10,000 bounty on [[Brett Favre]], was suspended for the entire season and three other players were suspended for parts of the season. However, in September 2012, an arbitrator overturned the suspensions of the players involved in the affair. Williams' suspension ultimately lasted one year.
* [[Deflategate]] (2015) – during the [[2014–15 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship Game: New England Patriots 45.2C Indianapolis Colts 7|AFC Championship Game]], 11 of the 12 the footballs (this was later proved to be false) under the Patriots' control during the first half were found to be inflated below the level mandated by the rulebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 of the 12 footballs deflated|url=http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/12202450/nfl-says-new-england-patriots-had-inflated-footballs-afc-championship-game|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was then closed because of the referees' failure to check the balls prior to the game. [[Tom Brady]] was suspended by the NFL for the first 4 games of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12867594/punishments-handed-tom-brady-new-england-patriots-deflategate|title=NFL suspends Brady 4 games; Pats lose picks|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association football scandals ==
* [[Totonero 1980|1980 Italian football scandal]] – a [[match fixing]] scandal in [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] involving several major teams.
* [[1988 Mexico national football team scandal]]
* [[French football bribery scandal|1993 French football bribery scandal]] – a match fixing scandal involving a [[1992–93 French Division 1]] match between [[Olympique de Marseille]] and [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]], in which Valenciennes players were bribed by Olympique de Marseille president [[Bernard Tapie]], through Marseille [[midfielder]] [[Jean-Jacques Eydelie]]. It is believed that Eydelie offered three Valenciennes players ([[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Christophe Robert]] and [[Jacques Glassmann|Jacques Glassman]]) [[French franc|₣]]250,000 to "take the foot off of the gas" in a May 20 match between the sides, so that the team would be fresh to play in the [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]] soon after. Marseille were subsequently stripped off the 1992–93 French Division 1 title, relegated to [[Ligue 2|Division 2]] and handed bans from all 1993 [[UEFA competitions]]. The [[French Football Federation]] also suspended Eydelie, Robert and Burruchaga, whilst Tapie was replaced as club president by [[Bernard Moreau]]. Tapie received a prison sentence of over two years, of which he served six months and received a [[French franc|₣]]20,000 fine, whilst Eydelie, Robert, Burruchaga and Marseille general manager [[Jean-Pierre Bernes]] were all given prison sentences and fined. Eydelie's prison sentence was a suspended sentence.
* [[Bundesliga scandal (2005)]] – a match fixing scandal in [[Football in Germany|German football]] centering on disgraced referee [[Robert Hoyzer]].
* [[Brazilian football match-fixing scandal]] (2005) – a match fixing scandal involving referees in [[Football in Brazil|Brazil]].
* [[2006 Italian football scandal|2006 Calciopoli scandal]] – a match fixing scandal in Italian football involving several major teams, including three of the country's four qualifiers to the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League]].
* In the [[Commonwealth of Independent States Cup]] [[2006 Commonwealth of Independent States Cup|2006]], the [[Armenia]]n champion [[FC Pyunik|Pyunik]] refused to play with an [[Azerbaijan]]i team, [[PFC Neftchi]]. The team [[FC Pyunik|Pyunik]] defeated the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] team [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] 3–1 in the quarter-final, when it already knew that in case of victory they would have to play against [[Neftçi PFK|Neftchi]]. After the match, they told the referee they would not play against an Azerbaijani team and later that evening left Moscow on an airplane. The [[Russian Football Union]] gave Shakhtar Donetsk a technical victory 3–0 so they could play in the half-final instead of Pyunik, but Shakhtar Donetsk declined the offer stating that "[W]e would really want to play in the half-final, but we don't want to get there by any other way then sport". Eventually, because no one could play against Neftchi in the half-final, Neftchi were right away promoted to the final, where they defeated the [[Lithuania]]n club [[FBK Kaunas|Kaunas]] 4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/sport/19jan2006/scandal.html|title=Новости NEWSru.com :: Скандал на Кубке Содружества: чемпионы Армении отказались играть с азербайджанцами|work=newsru.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[2011 Turkish sports corruption scandal]] – in July 2011, as part of a major match-fixing investigation by authorities in Turkey, nearly 60 people suspected to be involved with fixing games were detained by Istanbul Police Department Organized Crime Control Bureau and then arrested by the court. On June 2014, retrial process has started for all the convicted people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/07/turkey-match-fixing|title=Turkish court charges 15 more in Fenerbahce match-fixing scandal|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Spor/Futbol/2014/06/23/mahkeme-sike-davasi-kararini-verdi|title=Şike Davası'nda yeniden yargılama kararı|date=23 June 2014|work=Sabah}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[2015 Greek football scandal]] – it emerged on 6 April 2015, when prosecutor Aristidis Korreas' 173-page work was revealed. [[Telephone tapping]] operated by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service of Greece]] has played a significant role in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/264541493/1-%CE%A0%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%9A%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%8C%CF%83%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%BF | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=12 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prosecutor's conclusion, [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiakos.]] owner [[Evangelos Marinakis]] along with [[Hellenic Football Federation|Greek Football Federation]] members Theodoros Kouridis, Aristidis Stathopoulos and Georgios Sarris were suspected of directing a criminal organization since 2011. The goal behind their scheme was to "absolutely control Greek football's fate by the methods of blackmailing and fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/264541497/3-%CE%A0%CF%8C%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%9A%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%8C%CF%83%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%BF | script-title=el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page=159 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referees, judges, football directors and chairmen were also involved in the scandal, but all defendants deny charges.

* Tampered handwraps controversy of 2009 resulting in the suspension of [[Antonio Margarito]]

== College sporting scandals ==
* [[CCNY point shaving scandal]] – in 1951, more than 30 players at seven schools were implicated in a [[point shaving]] scheme that also had connections to organized crime. The scandal was most strongly linked to the [[City College of New York]] because several central figures had played on the school's [[1949–50 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team|1949–50 team]] that won that season's [[1950 NCAA Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and [[1950 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]].
* [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College basketball]] point shaving scandal in [[1978–79 Boston College basketball point shaving scandal|1978–79]]
* [[Southern Methodist University football scandal]] – in 1986, it was revealed that [[Southern Methodist University]] boosters gave football players thousands of dollars from a "slush fund" with the knowledge of university administrators. Along with a string of prior NCAA violations, this led the NCAA to level the [[Death penalty (NCAA)|"death penalty"]] on the school's football team.
* [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]] – four players, most notably [[Chris Webber]], were paid by a booster to launder money from his gambling operations. In some cases, the payments extended to their high school days.
* [[University of Minnesota basketball scandal]] – the ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]'' reported the day before the [[1999 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] that an academic counseling staffer at the university publicly acknowledged doing coursework for many basketball players.
*[[Baylor University basketball scandal]] – player Patrick Dennehy [[Murder of Patrick Dennehy|was murdered]] by teammate Carlton Dotson. Later, coach [[Dave Bliss]] instructed his players to lie to NCAA investigators that Dennehy dealt drugs. In the wake of these events, numerous violations of NCAA rules were discovered.
* [[Duke lacrosse case]] – a stripper hired by members of the [[Duke Blue Devils men's lacrosse|Duke University men's lacrosse team]] for an informal team party in 2006 falsely accused three players of [[rape]].
* [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill football scandal]] – over ten football players received improper benefits and committed academic fraud by turning in coursework prepared by tutors.
* [[2011 University of Miami athletics scandal]] – [[Yahoo! Sports]] broke a story in which former Miami booster [[Nevin Shapiro]], currently imprisoned for running a [[Ponzi scheme]], indicated he had provided massive amounts of improper benefits to Miami players and coaches, mostly in [[Miami Hurricanes football|football]], but also in [[Miami Hurricanes men's basketball|men's basketball]].
* [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal]] – in November 2011, former Penn State defensive coordinator [[Jerry Sandusky]] was arrested on 40 counts of sexually abusing eight boys over a 15-year period including incidents in Penn State's football facilities. In June 2012, Sandusky was convicted on 45 charges related to the scandal.
* [[University of North Carolina academic-athletic scandal]] – in a follow-up to the UNC football scandal, new accusations of academic fraud arose in relation to the university's African and Afro-American Studies department and men's basketball program, men's football team, women's soccer and other sports as well. The Wainstein Report, an independent report commissioned by UNC, revealed academic fraud that occurred over at least 18 years involving thousands of students and student athletes. Allegedly, thousands of student athletes were directed by the UNC administration to take "sham" classes in order to maintain eligibility. UNC avoided major NCAA penalties, mainly because said sham classes had been offered to the entire student body.
* [[2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal]] – In 2015, Yahoo! Sports reported that a self-described former [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] alleged that she had been paid several thousand dollars from 2010 to 2014 by men's basketball staffer [[Andre McGee]] for strip shows and sex parties for players and prospective recruits. The NCAA announced the results of its investigation in June 2017, announcing major sanctions that included a 10-year [[show-cause penalty]] for McGee and the potential loss of the team's [[2012–13 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|2013 national title]]. An appeal by Louisville failed, and in February 2018 the Cardinals became the first Division I basketball program to be stripped of a national championship.
*[[Baylor University sexual assault scandal]] – in 2016, Baylor and its [[Baylor Bears football|football program]] were rocked by the revelation that university officials failed to act on numerous alleged sexual and non-sexual assaults by football team members between 2012 and 2016, with one player convicted of felony sexual assault. A later lawsuit filed by a group of victims alleged that 31 football players committed 52 rapes between 2011 and 2014. In the wake of the scandal, head football coach [[Art Briles]] was fired, athletic director [[Ian McCaw]] resigned, and university president [[Ken Starr]] was first demoted and then resigned.
* [[2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal]] – An ongoing [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation into corruption in NCAA men's basketball that has so far resulted in the arrest of 10 individuals, including college assistant coaches from Arizona, Auburn, Oklahoma State, and USC plus high-ranking executives of sports apparel giant [[Adidas]]. Other programs initially implicated in the scandal included Louisville, Miami (FL), and South Carolina. Louisville placed head coach [[Rick Pitino]] and athletic director [[Tom Jurich]] (the latter not directly involved in the scandal) on administrative leave, and soon fired both. Further revelations in February 2018 saw more than a dozen additional programs possibly implicated.

== Cricket scandals ==
{{further information|Betting controversies in cricket}}
* [[John the bookmaker controversy]] – a scandal in which [[Australia national cricket team|Australia's]] [[Mark Waugh]] and [[Shane Warne]] were paid in 1994–95 to provide information on [[cricket pitch|pitch]] and weather conditions to an Indian bookmaker. The scandal came to light in 1998.
* [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal]] – in 2010, three [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] players—team captain [[Salman Butt]], [[Mohammad Asif]] and [[Mohammad Amir]]—were accused of involvement in a [[spot-fixing]] scheme in which they allegedly accepted large sums of money to influence specific events within a match, as opposed to an actual match result. After an investigation, the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] banned all three from the sport for periods from 5 to 10 years. Later, Butt and Asif were tried in a London court and found guilty of charges related to the scheme, whilst Amir pleaded guilty to similar charges in the same court. All received prison sentences ranging from 6 to 30 months.
* [[South Africa cricket match fixing]] in 2000 which resulted in the banning from cricket of [[Hansie Cronje]]

* [[Doping at the 2007 Tour de France]] – the [[2007 Tour de France]] was rocked by a series of doping scandals. Two riders, including pre-race favorite [[Alexander Vinokourov]], were disqualified for doping offenses. Both teams involved pulled out of the Tour.

[[File:Nordic Walkers near Ilkley 020.JPG|thumb|300px|Nordic Walkers in [[Ilkley]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]
'''Nordic walking''' is a total body version of [[walking]] that can be enjoyed both by non-athletes as a health-promoting physical activity, and by athletes as a sport. The activity is performed with specially designed walking poles similar to [[ski poles]].

==History==
Nordic walking (originally Finnish sauvakävely) is fitness walking with specially designed poles. While trekkers, backpackers and skiers had been using the basic concept for decades, Nordic Walking was first formally defined with the publication of "''Hiihdon lajiosa''" (translation: "A part of cross-country skiing training methodic") by [[Mauri Repo]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tul.fi/Portals/0/DOKUMENTIT/Koulutus/Vanhat%20materiaalit/Hiihdon%20lajiosa%201979.pdf|format=PDF|title=KOULUTUSAINEISTOA MAURI REPO : SEURAVALMENTAJAN PERUSTIEDOT HIIHDON LAJIOSA|website=Tul.fi|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''({{wikisource-inline|Hiihdon lajiosa}}.)'' Nordic Walking's concept was developed on the basis of off-season ski-training activity while using one-piece ski poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inwa-nordicwalking.com/?p=202#more-202|title=The History of Nordic Walking|website=Inwa-nordic-walking.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Скандинавская ходьба (Украина).jpg|thumb|]]

For decades hikers and backpackers used their one-piece ski poles long before trekking and Nordic walking poles came onto the scene. Ski racers deprived of snow have always used and still do use their one-piece ski poles for ski walking and hill bounding. The first poles specially designed and marketed to fitness walkers were produced by Exerstrider of the USA in 1988. ''Nordic Walker'' poles were produced and marketed by [[Exel Composites|Exel]] in 1997. Exel coined and popularized the term 'Nordic Walking' in 1999.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Benefits==
Compared to regular walking, Nordic walking (also called pole walking) involves applying force to the poles with each stride. Nordic walkers use more of their entire body (with greater intensity) and receive fitness building stimulation not present in normal walking for the chest, [[latissimus dorsi muscle]], triceps, biceps, shoulder, abdominals, spinal and other core muscles that may result in significant increases in heart rate at a given pace.&lt;ref&gt;Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise VOL. 27, NO. 4 April1995:607-11&lt;/ref&gt; Nordic walking has been estimated as producing up to a 46% increase in energy consumption, compared to walking without poles.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper Institute, ''Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sports'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Field testing of physiological responses associated with Nordic Walking|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=12230336 | doi=10.1080/02701367.2002.10609023 |volume=73 |journal=Res Q Exerc Sport |pages=296–300 | last1 = Church | first1 = TS | last2 = Earnest | first2 = CP | last3 = Morss | first3 = GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of the research, conducted by the group scientists from various universities*, both Nordic walking and conventional walking are beneficial for older adults. However, Nordic walking provides additional benefits in muscular strength compared to conventional walking, making it suitable for improving aerobic capacity and muscular strength as well as other components of functional fitness in a short period of time. 
The key  points stated by the study authors are:
Nordic walking, conventional walking, and resistance training are beneficial for older adults.
*Nordic walking and conventional walking both improve cardio-respiratory fitness while resistance training does not.
*Nordic walking provides additional benefits in upper-body muscular strength compared to conventional walking.
*Nordic walking is an effective and efficient mode of exercise to improve overall fitness in older adults.

[[File:Рукоять и темляк палок для скандинавской ходьбы.jpg|thumb|The handle of a walking pole]]
[[File:Push and Pull.jpg|thumb|Spike for offroad and rubber for asphalt]]
Nordic walking poles are significantly shorter than those recommended for cross-country skiing. Nordic walking poles come in one-piece, non-adjustable shaft versions, available in varying lengths, and telescoping two or three piece twist-locking versions of adjustable length. One piece poles are generally stronger and lighter, but must be matched to the user.  Telescoping poles are 'one-size fits all', and are more transportable.

Nordic walking poles feature a range of grips and wrist-straps, or rarely, no wrist-strap at all. The straps eliminate the need to tightly grasp the grips.
As with many trekking poles, Nordic walking poles come with removable [[Natural rubber|rubber]] tips for use on hard surfaces and hardened metal tips for trails, the beach, snow and ice. Most poles are made from lightweight [[aluminium]], [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]], or [[composite material]]s. Special walking shoes are not required, although there are shoes being marketed as specifically designed for the sport.

==Technique==
The cadences of the arms, legs and body are, rhythmically speaking, similar to those used in normal, vigorous, walking. The range of arm movement regulates the length of the stride. Restricted arm movements will mean a natural restricted pelvic motion and stride length. The longer the pole thrust, the longer the stride and more powerful the swing of the pelvis and upper torso.

An '''omnium''' (from Latin: of all, belonging to all) is a multiple race event in [[track cycling]]. Historically the omnium has had a variety of formats.  In recent years, road racing has also adopted the term to describe multi-day races that feature the three primary road race events ([[time trial]], mass start and [[criterium]]).

==History==
The omnium was re-introduced into the World Championships as a five race track cycling format [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Men's omnium|for men]] in 2007 and [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships – Women's omnium|for women]] in 2009. The omnium was changed in 2010 by the UCI to include the elimination race and the distances of the events were lengthened to favour endurance cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Birnie|first=Lionel|title=Olympic omnium format unveiled|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/435675/olympic-omnium-format-unveiled.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=Cycling Weekly|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The omnium replaced the [[individual pursuit]], the [[points race]], and the [[Madison (cycling)|Madison]] at the [[Cycling at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] beginning in [[Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]. The change received some criticism from cyclist [[Rebecca Romero]], who was left unable to defend her Olympic title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romero and Wiggins lose out in Olympic cycling shake-up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/8403854.stm|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=BBC Sport: Cycling|date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current omnium==
[[File:Ciclismo de pista (28395640743).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Omnium scratch race at the [[Rio Olympics]]]]
From June 2014 until the end of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ Rule Changes Track June 2014|url=http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/52/70/RulechangestrackJune2014-ENG_English.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the omnium as defined by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) consisted of the following six events held over 2 days:

# [[Scratch race]]
# [[Individual pursuit]]
#: 4,000 metres for elite men, 3,000 metres for junior men and elite women, and 2,000 metres for junior women
# [[Elimination races#Miss and out|Elimination race]]
# [[Track time trial|Time trial]]
#: 1&amp;nbsp;km men, 500 metres women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 6 Kilometre and 500 metres Time Trial|url=http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTkzNg&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=NDk3OTg&amp;LangId=1|work=Part 3: Track Races|publisher=UCI Cycling Regulations|page=21|accessdate=6 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806032756/http://www.uci.ch/Modules/BUILTIN/getObject.asp?MenuId=MTkzNg&amp;ObjTypeCode=FILE&amp;type=FILE&amp;id=NDk3OTg&amp;LangId=1|archivedate=6 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Flying lap (against the clock)
# [[Points race]]
#: 40&amp;nbsp;km for elite men, 25&amp;nbsp;km for elite women, 25&amp;nbsp;km for junior men, 20&amp;nbsp;km for junior women

For the first five events, each winner was awarded 40 points, each second place 38 points, each third place 36, etc.  Riders ranked 21st and below will each be awarded 1 point.
In the Points Race, riders add to and lose points from their totals based on laps gained and lost, and points won in sprints.

After the 2016 season, the three timed events - the sprint time trial, flying lap and individual pursuit were all removed from the event, a [[Points race#Tempo|tempo race]] added, and the event shortened to a  single day. The points race as final race format remains with minor modifications.

# [[Scratch race]]
# [[Elimination races#Miss and out|Elimination race]]
# [[Points race#Tempo|Tempo race]]
# [[Points race]]
#: 25&amp;nbsp;km for elite men, 20&amp;nbsp;km for elite women, 20&amp;nbsp;km for junior men, 15&amp;nbsp;km for junior women

The winner of the Omnium is the rider who has obtained the highest total of points.

In the event of a tie in the final ranking, the places in the final sprint of the last event,
the Points Race, breaks the tie. 

A rider must have completed every event in the omnium.

==Road racing omnium==
A road race omnium consists of a [[time trial]], a [[criterium]], and a [[Bike race|mass-start road race]] - typically held across a weekend or other 2-3 day period.  Points are awarded to the top finishers at each event and totaled at the end of the event.  The overall winner for the event is chosen based on the number of accumulated points.  Often, organizers will stipulate that riders must complete each event in order to qualify for the overall prize.

'''Penalty cards''' are used in many sports as a means of warning, reprimanding or penalising a player, coach or team official. Penalty cards are most commonly used by [[referee]]s or umpires to indicate that a player has committed an offense. The official will hold the card above his or her head while looking or pointing towards the player that has committed the offence. This action makes the decision clear to all players, as well as spectators and other officials in a manner that is language-neutral. The colour or shape of the card used by the official indicates the type or seriousness of the offence and the level of punishment that is to be applied. Yellow and red cards are the most common, typically indicating, respectively, cautions and dismissals.

==History and origin==
The idea of using language-neutral coloured cards to communicate a referee's intentions originated in [[association football]], with English referee [[Ken Aston]].&lt;ref name="KenAston"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/news/newsid=80623/index.html | title = Ken Aston – the inventor of yellow and red cards | publisher = fifa.com | accessdate = February 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aston had been appointed to the [[FIFA]] Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]], [[England national football team|England]] met [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee [[Rudolf Kreitlein]] had cautioned Englishmen [[Bobby Charlton|Bobby]] and [[Jack Charlton]], as well as sending off Argentinian [[Antonio Rattín]]. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, and England manager [[Alf Ramsey]] approached FIFA representative for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on [[traffic light]]s (yellow – stop if safe to do so, red – stop) would transcend language barriers and make it clear that a player had been cautioned or expelled.&lt;ref name=KenAston/&gt; As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico. The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.

==Commonly used penalty cards==

===Yellow card===
[[Image:Yellow card.svg|thumb|A yellow card is used in several sports and most commonly indicates a warning or a temporary suspension]]

A '''yellow card''' is used in many different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports; however, it most commonly indicates a caution given to a player regarding his or her conduct, or indicates a temporary suspension. Examples include:
*[[Association football]]: A yellow card is shown by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.&lt;ref name="FIFAwebsite"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html/ | title = Laws of the Game | publisher = fifa.com | accessdate = June 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a "booking". A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the yellow card again, and then a [[Red card (association football)|red card]]), meaning that he must leave the field immediately and take no further part in the game. The player may not be replaced by a substitute. Law 12 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] (which are set by the [[International Football Association Board]] and used by [[FIFA]]) lists the [[Misconduct (association football)|types of offences and misconduct]] that may result in a caution or is cautionary. It also states that "only a player, substitute or substituted player" can be cautioned.&lt;ref name=FIFAwebsite/&gt;[[File:Ronaldo yellow card.jpg|thumb|[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] is shown the yellow card]]
:In most tournaments, the accumulation of a certain number of yellow cards over several matches results in disqualification of the offending player for a certain number of subsequent matches, the exact number of cards and matches varying by jurisdiction.
:For more details, see ''[[Yellow card (association football)]]''
*[[Sport of athletics|Athletics]]: In track events, a yellow card is as a personal warning in both track and field events used to indicate that a second yellow card would result in a disqualification.&lt;ref name="athgreencard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.european-athletics.org/files/12-starting_guidelines-april2009.pdf|title=IAAF Starting Guidelines}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IAAF]] rules have abolished false start warnings; false starts now result in immediate disqualification except in combined events where a diagonal yellow/black card indicates a warning for false start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/6018077/World-Athletics-IAAF-sanctions-immediate-disqualification-for-false-starts-come-January.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=IAAF sanctions immediate disqualification for false starts come January| date=August 12, 2009 | accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as of 2012, the false start rule is that an athlete's hands must leave the track or their feet must leave the starting blocks before the gunshot in order for a false start to be given. Therefore, if an athlete makes a twitch, while being in their final 'set' position, the maximum penalty is a yellow card.   
*[[Australian rules football]]: A yellow card is issued against a player for committing any reportable offence (such as striking an opponent, swearing at an official, amongst others), except those listed as 'serious' reportable offences. Any player issued a yellow card is unable to participate in the game for the length of a quarter of play, excluding breaks, although the player can be replaced. However, a yellow card may be issued against a player at the discretion of an umpire, despite the player not committing a reportable offence. Yellow cards and red cards are, however, not issued in the [[Australian Football League]], the highest level of play in Australian rules football.&lt;ref name="AFL Laws of the Game"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf | title = AFL Laws of the Game | publisher = AFL Commission | accessdate = October 20, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120522111034/http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf | archivedate = May 22, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Badminton]]: A yellow card is given to a singles player or doubles pair as a warning for breaching the Laws of Badminton. A yellow card can only be given once to a player or pair in a match, subsequent breaches are sanctioned with a red or black card.&lt;ref name="badmintonlaws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of badminton|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=608602&amp;dl=1|website=bwfbadminton.org|publisher=[[Badminton World Federation]]|accessdate=1 March 2015|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="badmintontechnical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations to technical officials|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=550377&amp;dl=1|website=bwfbadminton.org|publisher=[[Badminton World Federation]]|accessdate=1 March 2015|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bandy]]: A yellow card indicates a warning given to an entire team for technical fouls such as errors in the execution of goal-throws or free strokes, or the obstruction of a player without ball.&lt;ref name="Bandywebsite"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.internationalbandy.com/ | title = Bandy – Rules of Play | publisher = internationalbandy.com | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent technical fouls by the same team result in a five-minute penalty indicated by a [[Penalty card#White card|white card]].
*[[Canoe polo]]: A yellow card indicates a player has received a two-minute temporary suspension.&lt;ref name="CPrules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canoepolonz.org.nz/default.asp?Page=2996 |title=International Canoe Polo – Rules of Play |publisher=canoepolonz.org.nz |accessdate=June 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014053924/http://www.canoepolonz.org.nz/default.asp?Page=2996 |archivedate=October 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A yellow card can be awarded for a deliberate or dangerous foul that prevents the scoring of a near certain goal, dangerous illegal play that is deliberate or repeated, foul or abusive language, continuously disputing a referee's decisions or receiving a third green card for any reason.
*[[Equestrian sports]]: Yellow cards may be issued during [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] sanctioned events for abuse of a horse or incorrect behavior towards an official.&lt;ref name="Erules"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fei.org/Rules/Documents/GeneralRegulations_22ndedition_effective1June2007.pdf |title=FEI General Regulations |publisher=fei.org |accessdate=September 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704030028/http://www.fei.org/Rules/Documents/GeneralRegulations_22ndedition_effective1June2007.pdf |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse of the horse may include riding an obviously lame horse, riding an exhausted horse, excessive use of [[whip]] or [[spur]]s, and dangerous riding. Riders may choose not to accept issued cards, but doing so may lead to a disciplinary hearing. A rider receiving a yellow card can be disqualified from the event and subsequently fined or suspended.&lt;ref name="Erules"/&gt;
*[[Fencing (sport)|Fencing]]: A yellow card indicates a warning to a fencer and is valid for the remainder of the bout.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.britishfencing.com/governance/rules/fie-rules/ | title = FIE Competition Rules | publisher = britishfencing.com | accessdate = Sep 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, an annulment of any hit scored by the fencer at fault may also occur. Yellow cards are awarded for Group 1 offences such as making bodily contact with the opposing fencer (in [[Foil (fencing)|foil]] or [[Sabre (fencing)|sabre]]), leaving the piste without permission, or refusing to obey the referee. A yellow card can also be awarded when, at the first call by the referee, a fencer does not present himself on the piste ready to fence. Any person not on the piste who disturbs the good order of the competition may also receive a yellow card on the first infringement.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt;
*[[Field hockey]]: A yellow card indicates a temporary suspension of at least 5 minutes. The length of the suspension is determined by the umpire.&lt;ref name="Rules of Hockey"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fih.ch/media/807896/fih-rules-of-hockey-2015.pdf | title = Rules of Hockey | publisher = FIH | accessdate = November 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for a player to receive two yellow cards for different offences during the same match; however, the period of suspension must be significantly longer with each yellow card. When an offence for which a yellow card has been awarded is repeated, the yellow card must not be used again and a more severe penalty must be awarded. There must also be a clear difference between the duration of a yellow card suspension for a minor offence and the duration for a major offence. The yellow card can be shown to a specific player or to the captain for misconduct by the entire team.&lt;ref name="Rules of Hockey"/&gt; In this case, the captain is temporarily suspended.
*[[Gaelic games]]: In [[camogie]], [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]] a yellow card ({{Lang-ga|cárta buí}}) is given to players for moderate fouls. A player who receives two yellow cards in a single game is sent off and receives a red card.
*[[Handball]]: A yellow card indicates a warning and can be given to a player or team official for unsportsmanlike conduct, or to a player whose actions are mainly or exclusively directed at the opponent and not at the ball. [[International Handball Federation|IHF]] rules also allow referees to use discretion to award a yellow card outside of these situations.&lt;ref name="IHF rules"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ihf.info/ | title = International Handball Federation – Rules of the Game 2005 | publisher = ihf.info | accessdate = June 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mixed martial arts]] promotions [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] (defunct), [[Deep (mixed martial arts)|DEEP]], and [[ZST]]: A warning, the third leads to disqualification.
*[[Racewalking]]: A yellow card indicates a competitor's foot fails to be on the ground when the rear leg is being raised, or the front leg is not straightened when it makes contact with the ground.&lt;ref name="What is Olympic Race Walking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trackandfield.about.com/od/distanceevents/a/olymwalkbasic.htm|title=Olympic Race Walking Basics|author=Mike Rosenbaum|work=About.com Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rugby league]]: Yellow cards are not usually used in rugby league in the southern hemisphere with referees indicating a 10-minute suspension by raising both arms straight out with fingers spread (to indicate 10 minutes). This is otherwise known as a "[[sin bin]]". However, in the northern hemisphere it is common for a referee to use a yellow card in signaling a "[[sin bin]]" to indicate 10 minutes instead of using the arm and hand signal used in the southern hemisphere. It is possible for a player to receive seven yellow cards without receiving a red card (a player who receives eight yellow cards in a match will receive a red card, which results in ejection from the match). However, it is up to the referee's discretion at how bad the offences are, and in these cases, a red card may be commonly shown for a second major offence without the presence of a second yellow card.
*[[Rugby union]]: According to the laws of the game published by [[World Rugby]] (WR), during international matches, any player who commits an offence under Law 9 – Foul Play may be shown a yellow card and suspended from the game for 10 minutes (2 minutes in [[rugby sevens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/?law=9&amp;variation=2 |title=Law 9 – Foul Play (Sevens Variation) |work=Laws of the Game: Rugby Union |publisher=World Rugby |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the player cannot be replaced during that time.&lt;ref name="World Rugby laws"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/?law=9 |title=Law 9 – Foul Play |work=Laws of the Game: Rugby Union |publisher=World Rugby |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offences include obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the game. Receiving a yellow card is known colloquially as being sent to the "sin bin". A player receiving a second yellow card in a game will also be shown a red card (see below) meaning that he or she has been [[ejection (sports)|sent-off]] and will be unable to take part in the remainder of the match.
*[[Volleyball]]: Under FIVB rules a yellow card is the second stage of a formal warning for a player(s)/coach for minor misconduct, the first being a verbal one given through the team captain.  It is recorded on the scoresheet but has no immediate consequences - there is no loss of service (if applicable) and no point awarded to the opposition. It is shown together with a red card (in one hand) where a player(s)/coach is sanctioned with expulsion, and (with a card in each hand) separately with a red card where a player(s)/coach is sanctioned with disqualification, all such offences are recorded on the scoresheet.
*[[Water polo]]: Given as an official warning for disrespectful conduct from the coach, individual players, or the entire bench.

[[Image:Red card.svg|thumb|A red card is used in several sports and most commonly indicates a serious offense and can often mean that a player has been removed from the game and may be barred from the next game as well.]]

A '''red card''' is used in several different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports, but it most commonly indicates a serious offence and often results in a player being permanently suspended from the game (commonly known as an [[Ejection (sports)|ejection]], dismissal, expulsion, removal, or sending-off, often with [[Walk of shame|personal embarrassment]]). In many sports the ejected player's team cannot replace them and thus must continue the rest of the game with one fewer player, which may be a significant disadvantage. Examples include:
*[[Association football]]: A red card is shown by a [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to signify that a player has been sent off.&lt;ref name="FIFAwebsite"/&gt; A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately and must take no further part in the game.  The player who has been sent off cannot be replaced during the game; his team must continue the game with one player fewer. Only players, substitutes and substituted players may receive a red card.  If a goalkeeper receives a red card another player will be allowed to assume goalkeeping duties (teams will usually [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] an outfield player for another goalkeeper if this option is available). A red card will be shown to a player who has committed a serious offense such as violent conduct or an illegal and purposeful obstruction of a goal scoring opportunity for the opposing team. A red card will also be shown to a player who accumulates two yellow cards for more minor offenses. 
:For more details, see ''[[Red card (association football)]]''.
*[[Sport of athletics|Athletics]]: A red card indicates that the athlete is disqualified after receiving 2 yellow cards. A diagonal red/black card is issued if a false start has been made.&lt;ref name="athgreencard"/&gt;
*[[Australian rules football]]: A red card is issued against a player who has accumulated two yellow cards over the course of a match, or has committed a 'serious reportable offence' (such as striking an umpire or kicking an opponent). A player issued with a red card may not participate for the remainder of the match; however, unlike most sports, the player can be replaced, although not until a length of time equivalent to one-quarter (excluding breaks) has elapsed. Yellow cards and red cards are, however, not issued in the [[Australian Football League]], the highest level of play in Australian rules football.&lt;ref name="AFL Laws of the Game"/&gt;
*[[Badminton]]: A red card is given to a singles player or doubles pair to penalize subsequent infractions after receiving a yellow card. It counts as fault, meaning the opposing side is awarded a point. After a second red card, a player or pair may be disqualified with a black card at the tournament referee's discretion.&lt;ref name="badmintonlaws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="badmintontechnical"/&gt;
*[[Bandy]]: A red card indicates a [[match penalty]], i.e. a player has been excluded for the remainder of the match and cannot be substituted.&lt;ref name="Bandywebsite"/&gt; Red card offenses include directly attacking an opponent or using abusive language. A coach or substitute may also be penalized with a red card. In this situation, a player currently on the rink also serves a ten-minute penalty, resulting in the number of players being reduced by one.
*[[Canoe polo]]: A red card indicates a player has been sent off for the remainder of the match and cannot be substituted.&lt;ref name="CPrules"/&gt; A red card can be awarded if a personal attack on a player occurs, repeated foul or abusive language, or when the award of a yellow card is disputed or has not had the desired effect of causing the player to control his play or attitude. A red card is also awarded when a player has received a second yellow card for any reason.
*[[Cricket]]: In December 2016, it was announced that by October 2017 cricket umpires would be given the power to issue red cards to send off players who have committed the following: “threatening an umpire; physically assaulting another player, umpire, official or spectator; or any other act of violence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/07/mcc-recommend-red-cards-sending-off-laws-of-cricket|title=MCC recommends sendings off be introduced into laws of cricket|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 December 2016|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Fencing]]: A red card is used to indicate that a fencer has committed an offence that warrants a penalty hit to be awarded to the opponent.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt; Second and subsequent Group 1 offences, all Group 2 offences and first Group 3 offences are penalised with a red card.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt; A red card may also be awarded when, at the second call by the referee, a fencer does not present himself on the piste ready to fence.
*[[Field hockey]]: A red card results in a player being permanently suspended from the game. The player cannot take any further part in the game and cannot be substituted. Unlike other penalty cards in field hockey, the red card is never given to the captain for team misconduct. In addition to their colour, red cards in field hockey are often circular in shape.&lt;ref name="Rules of Hockey"/&gt;
*[[Floorball]]: A red card is results in the player being ejected from the game and his/her team being penalised with a 5 minute bench penalty. In floorball, the red card can be linked with 3 different types of Match Penalties (MP 1, 2 and 3). MP1 is linked with violent play during the game, such as heavy hits (pushing) against the goal-cage or boarding; this penalty does not cause additional suspension in the tournament. MP2 is linked with offences such as sabotage of the game, mild brawl (no punches), and is also given when a player receives his/her second 5 minute bench penalty; this match penalty causes an automatic 1 game suspension. MP3 is linked with vulgar conduct, such as insulting the referee, another player or spectators, violent conduct that is not directly linked with play (such as punching an opponent); this match penalty causes an automatic 1 game suspension, and is further reviewed by a disciplinary committee that can penalise the player with additional suspension.
[[Image:Cropped-red-card-handball.jpg|thumb|right|A red card shown in a handball match]]
*[[Gaelic games]]: In [[camogie]], [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]] a red card ({{Lang-ga|cárta dearg}}) is given to players for serious fouls and violent conduct. A player who receives two yellow cards in a single game is sent off and receives a red card.
*[[Handball]]: A red card indicates a disqualification of a player who has committed an offense such as unsportsmanlike conduct, serious foul play, or receiving a third two-minute suspension.&lt;ref name="IHF rules"/&gt; A red card prevents a player from playing for the remainder of the match and as a result reduces the number of players that are available to a team.  A red card also carries a two-minute suspension for the team, meaning that a team cannot replace the disqualified player until the two-minute team suspension has expired.&lt;ref name="IHF rules"/&gt;
*[[Racewalking]]: A red card indicates that a competitor's foot failed to be on the ground when the rear leg is being raised or that his front leg is not straightened when it makes contact with the ground.  A judge would issue a yellow card for the first infraction committed by a competitor. And if the same judge detects the second infraction from the same competitor, a red card is issued.  Three red cards, from three different judges, will result in a competitor's disqualification.&lt;ref name="What is Olympic Race Walking"/&gt;
*[[Rugby league]]: Red cards are not usually used in rugby league in the southern hemisphere with referees indicating a player has been sent from the field for the rest of the match with one extended arm above the head with the index finger pointed in the direction of a sideline. However, in the northern hemisphere, it is common for a referee to use a red card in signaling a player has been sent from the field for the rest of the match, with no replacement allowed. It is possible for a player to receive seven yellow cards without receiving a red card (a player who receives eight yellow cards in a match will receive a red card, which results in ejection from the match). However, it is up to the referee's discretion at how bad the offenses are, and in these cases, a red card may be commonly shown for a second major offense without the presence of a second yellow card.
*[[Rugby union]]: A red card is used to indicate that a player has been sent off and can take no further part in the game.&lt;ref name="World Rugby laws"/&gt; He cannot be replaced, leaving his team with one fewer player for the remainder of the game. During international matches, a player who commits an offense under Law 9 – Foul Play may be shown a red card. Red cards are normally issued for serious offenses. Any player receiving a second yellow card in a game will automatically be shown a red card.
*[[Volleyball]]: A red card can be issued by the referee for the first instance of Rude Conduct. It is recorded on the scoresheet and results in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point to the opposition. Rude Conduct is the only category of sanction punished by a Red card alone, and which results in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point. For the sanctions of Expulsion and Disqualification, a Red and Yellow card is shown simultaneously, held together in one hand, or separately in each hand, respectively.
:* [[beach volleyball|Two Man (beach)]]:  The rules vary in one aspect from the six-a-side competition. A red card is shown for the first and any second offense of Rude Conduct in the same set. It is recorded on the scoresheet, resulting in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point to the opposition. Otherwise the procedural use of cards is the same as for six-a-side.
*[[Water polo]]: A red card is issued to a coach or player on the bench for a second incident of misconduct after receiving a yellow card or severe unsporting conduct. A person receiving a red card must leave the competition area.

==Other types of penalty card==

===Green card===
[[Image:greencardhockey.svg|thumb|In [[field hockey]], a triangular-shaped green card indicates a 2 minute suspension for field players and a warning for a coach.]]

[[File:Indiana (80) (5028145116).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Penn State Nittany Lions field hockey|Penn State]] field hockey player receives a green card.]]
A '''green card''' is used in some sports to indicate an official warning to a player who has committed a minor offence that does not warrant a more serious sanction.
*[[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]]: A green card indicates that the recall did not warrant a warning, which most commonly happens when the machines used to catch false-starters make a mistake.&lt;ref name="athgreencard"/&gt;
*[[Canoe polo]]: A green card indicates an official warning that can be applied to an individual player or a whole team.&lt;ref name="CPrules"/&gt; A green card can be awarded for deliberate unsporting behavior or unnecessary verbal communication to the referee.
*[[Field hockey]]: A green card indicates an official warning when a minor offence has occurred. A second green card for the same player will result in a yellow card (5 minute suspension). In this case, the umpire will show a green card, followed by a yellow card. When an offence for which a green card has been awarded is repeated, a yellow card should be awarded. A green card can be given to a specific player or to the captain as a warning to the entire team. Cards shown to the captain as a warning to the team are treated separate from cards shown to the captain as a player. In addition to their colour, green cards in field hockey are triangular in shape.&lt;ref name="Rules of Hockey"/&gt; Under FIH Rules of Hockey, the green card carries a two-minute suspension during which time that player's team plays with one fewer player.
*[[Association football]]: A few minor leagues use a green card as an indication of ''commendable'' conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=¿Qué es la tarjeta verde? (What is the green card?) |url=http://www.rfef.es/noticias/que-es-tarjeta-verde |website=RFEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La Serie B e la novità del 'cartellino verde'(The Serie B and the novelty of the 'green card') |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/news/cataliotti-la-serie-b-e-la-novita-del-cartellino-verde-ecco-cos--202500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White card===
{{double image|right|white card.svg|60|blue card.svg|60|In bandy, a white card indicates a five-minute penalty while a blue card indicates a ten-minute penalty.}}
A '''white card''' is used in [[bandy]] to indicate a five-minute timed penalty given to a player.&lt;ref name="Bandywebsite"/&gt; The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 5 minute period the player may not be replaced, although he or she may be replaced with a different player when the penalty has expired. Offences that can warrant a white card include trying to hinder the opponents from executing a free-stroke, illegal substitution or repeated illegal but non-violent attacks on an opponent.

In the 2012 [[Super Rugby]] season in rugby union, a White Card was introduced for incidents of suspected foul play where the referee is unsure of the identity of the perpetrator, or where the referee is unsure if a red card is warranted. The incident is later referred to the citing commissioner, and may result in a suspension for the offending player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/super-rugby-2012/rugby/story/159785.html|title=Super Rugby: White card set for Super Rugby bow - Live Rugby News - ESPN Scrum|work=ESPN scrum}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to a citation sign (arms crossed above the head) in rugby league. However, in 2013 the International Rugby Board, now known as World Rugby, extended the powers of the [[Rugby union match officials#Television match official|TMO]] to include reviewing suspected incidents of foul play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby365.com/article/51557-new-tmo-protocol|title=Rugby365 - New TMO protocol|work=rugby365.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, no white cards were issued in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/8982249/Rennie-apologises-for-bizarre-semi-incident|title=Rennie apologises for bizarre semi incident|work=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue card===
A '''blue card''' or 'Blue Disk' as pioneered by The Elms, is used in [[bandy]] to indicate a ten-minute timed penalty given to a player.&lt;ref name="Bandywebsite"/&gt; The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 10 minute period the player may not be replaced, although he or she may be replaced with a different player when the penalty has expired. A blue card is typically shown for offences that are more serious than those warranting a white card including attacking an opponent in a violent or dangerous way, causing advantage by intentionally stopping the ball with a high stick or protesting a referee's decision.

A blue card is also frequently used in indoor soccer in the United States, signifying that the offender must leave the field and stay in a penalty box (usually 2–5 minutes), during which time their team plays down a man (identical to [[ice hockey]] and [[roller hockey]]). If a goal is scored by the team opposite of the offender, then the offender may return to the field immediately.  It is also used in the [[Clericus Cup]] association football league for a 5-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play. And it is also used in the [[beach soccer]] for a 2-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play.

A Blue Card is also used in [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]] to indicate a technical foul. The fouling player is sent to the penalty box for one minute or until a goal is scored against the fouling player's team. Unlike a yellow card, there is no additional penalty for multiple blue cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quidditch Rulebook|url=http://www.usquidditch.org/files/USQ_Rulebook_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In European indoor soccer or [[Futsal]], a Blue Card was used to send a player off the court; however the team was able to replace him with another player. The offending player could not return to play during the match. A blue card was shown directly for foul play or verbal abuse, if the same player had received two yellow cards, or if he had accumulated a total of 5 fouls during the game.

The Blue Card has been in use in Handball since the [[International Handball Federation]] announced a rule change that came into effect on July 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympichandball.org/2016/03/04/ihf-announces-rule-changes-effective-july-1st-2016/|title=IHF Announces Rule Changes Effective July 1st 2016 : Irish Olympic Handball Association|author=|date=|website=www.olympichandball.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; First the Red Card is shown, then the referee will after a short discussion show the blue card. Following that a written report will accompany the score sheet and the Disciplinary Commission will then decide on further actions against the player.&lt;ref&gt;http://cms.eurohandball.com/PortalData/1/Resources/1_ehf_main/3_download_pdf/Rule_changes_2016_03_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black card===
[[Image:Black card.svg|thumb|A black card in fencing indicates an offense serious enough to warrant a suspension]]

A '''black card''' is used in [[fencing]]. It is issued by the [[Tournament director|director]], or the referee for severe rule infractions.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt; A second instance of a Group 3 offence, and all Group 4 offences including deliberate brutality, refusal to fence, refusal to salute, and refusal to shake hands can be punished with a black card.&lt;ref name="Fencingrules"/&gt; When the black card is issued, the offending fencer is excluded from the remainder of the competition and may be suspended from further tournaments. In the official record of the tournament, his or her name is replaced with the words "FENCER EXCLUDED".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usfencing.org/usfa/content/view/1273/111/ |title=Fencing For Parents |accessdate=2008-08-14 |work=U.S. Fencing – The Official Website of the U.S. Fencing Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625054519/http://www.usfencing.org/usfa/content/view/1273/111/ |archivedate=2008-06-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A black card is also used in the sport of [[badminton]] to indicate disqualification.&lt;ref name=nyp&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/olympics/badminton_players_tossed_match_olympic_28mGWBb3T9toHrGlBOCMFI | title=8 badminton players tossed from Olympic doubles after being accused of throwing matches | work=New York Post | date=1 August 2012 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gaelic Games]] of [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]], a ''tick'' or ''black book'' – was formerly recorded against a player for a minor infringement not warranting a yellow card, though multiple bookings will result in the issuance of a yellow card. The act of the referee physically holding up his black notebook in the same manner as a card has been discontinued by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-throw-caution-to-wind-and-abandon-black-books-1732523.html|title=GAA throw caution to wind and abandon black books|newspaper=Irish Independent | first=Colm|last=Keys|date=May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning January 1, 2014 a player in [[Gaelic football]] can be ordered off the pitch for the remainder of the game with a substitution allowed by being physically shown a Black Card (the referee's black notebook) in the same manner as any other penalty card for "cynical behaviour," including blatant tripping, pulling down and bodychecking. This forced substitution is an intermediate punishment between the yellow and red cards. A player who receives a yellow card and a black card in the same game is sent off without any substitute being permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-pass-controversial-black-card-rule-29150028.html|date=23 March 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|title=GAA passcontroversial 'black card' rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72841">'''Politics and sports''' or '''sports diplomacy''' describes the use of sport as a means to influence diplomatic, social, and political relations. Sports diplomacy may transcend cultural differences and bring people together.

The use of sports and politics has had both positive and negative implications over history. Sports competitions or activities have had the intention to bring about change in certain cases. Nationalistic fervour is sometimes linked to victories or losses to some sport on sports fields.&lt;ref name="ipatrix"&gt;[http://www.ipatrix.com/873/separation-of-politics-and-sports/ Can sports and politics ever be separated?]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Poster-Joe-Louis.jpg|thumb|upright|right|United States [[World War II]] recruiting poster featuring boxer [[Joe Louis]].]] --&gt;

While the [[Olympics]] is often the biggest political example of using sports for diplomatic means, [[cricket]] and [[association football]], as well as other sports in the global arena, have also been used in this regard. In the case of [[Apartheid]], sport was used to isolate [[South Africa]] and bring about a major overhaul in the country's social structure. While ethnicity and race can cause division, sports can also help blend differences.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Stephen and Douglas Hartmann. "Ethnicity and Race: Making Identities in a Changing World." p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, numerous athletes have sought political office, some of them unsuccessfully, on either the national level or the sub-national level.

The most infamous declaration of politics and sport was the [[Football War]] between [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]]. Though the build-up to the war had to do with more socio-economic issues like immigration and land reform, the impetus for war was an inflammation of tensions set off by rioters during the second North American qualifying round for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. Disturbances broke out during the first game in [[Tegucigalpa]], but the second leg saw the situation get considerably worse in [[San Salvador]]. Honduran fans were roughed up, the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated. In retaliation, violence against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several [[Vice Consul]]s, increased. An unknown number of Salvadorans were killed or brutalized, and tens of thousands began fleeing the country. The press of both nations contributed to a growing climate of near-hysteria, and on June 27, 1969, twelve days after the second-leg game, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with El Salvador. On July 14, 1969, the Salvadoran army launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on July 20, with the Salvadoran troops withdrawn in early August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/sierra/soccer1969.htm|title=Armed Conflict Year Index|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel national football team|Israel]] was one of the founding members of the [[Asian Football Confederation]] following its own independence in 1948 (prior to that it played under the banner of "Palestine/[[Eretz Yisrael]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Site-Map-Israel-Football-Facts-and-Stats.html|title=Site-Map-Israel-Football-Facts---Stats|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1974 Asian Games]] in Iran (and a tense loss to Iran&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-afc.com/en/features-and-interviews/31318-bayati-recalls-irans-1968-afc-asian-cup-triumph Bayati recalls Iran's tense win over Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;), Kuwait and other Arab states refused to play them. Following this, they were expelled from the confederation and spent a few years trying to qualify from such continental bodies as the [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] before joining [[UEFA]].&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/worldcup2010 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=James | last=Montague | title=Time is right for Israel to return to its Asian roots | date=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 AFC Asian Cup]] held in China made headlines due to events that took place during the final between [[China national football team|China]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]], apparently due to [[China-Japan relations|historical relations]] dating back to World War II (see [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Nanjing Massacre]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3541380.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chinese riot after Japan victory | date=August 7, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese national anthem was being played, the home fans expressed their [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] by drowning out the national anthem with their chants. The Chinese home fans also continually booed the players, visiting fans and officials as they watched Japan defeat China 3–1. After the match, some Chinese fans rioted outside the [[Beijing Worker's Stadium]].

Once again, on September 6, 2008, [[Armenia]] and Turkey faced each other in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification match in [[Yerevan]]. In an unprecedented step, Turkish President [[Abdullah Gül]] was [[Armenia-Turkey relations|invited to watch]] the match, where he and his Armenia counterpart, [[Serzh Sargsyan]], sat together, albeit behind bullet-proof glass. However, the [[Turkish national anthem]] was almost drowned out by booing from 35,000 Armenian fans, showing there is still a lot of mistrust between the two countries. However, the gesture "between the presidents showed that they believed 'football diplomacy' had achieved the most important result." This was a first for the two countries divided by the legacy of the 20th century's first [[Armenian genocide|genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4698951.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Turkey and Armenia start to mend old emnities (''sic'') via World Cup football match | date=September 7, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Sadie | last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1839199,00.html | work=Time | title=Can Soccer Heal Turkey-Armenia Rift? | date=September 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Andrew | last=Purvis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/07/content_9819181.htm|title=Turkey-Armenia soccer diplomacy brings opportunity to help thaw frozen ties_English_Xinhua|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=152384 President Gül says Turkey-Armenia soccer match will generate important opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L4494093.htm|title=Humanitarian - Thomson Reuters Foundation News|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[France national football team|France]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] met in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification play-off, where the winner of the two-legged tie progressed through to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Africa]]. After a 1–1 aggregate draw, the match went into extra time at France's National Stadium. The winning goal came from France's [[William Gallas]], but in the build-up, [[Thierry Henry]] twice handled the ball, before passing to Gallas to score. It was seen as a "[[Hand of Frog]]" goal, in reference to the similar "[[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final)#.22Hand of God.22 goal|Hand of God]]" goal in the match between Argentina and England.

In 2010 [[Iran-Arab relations#United Arab Emirates|relations between Iran and the UAE]] took a turn for the worse when the [[Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran]] sent a letter to the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] complaining about the misuse of the ''[[Persian Gulf]]'' name. "The move was made after the UAE misrepresented the name ''[[Persian Gulf naming dispute|Persian Gulf]]'' during a match between Iran's Sepahan and the UAE's Al Ain. The Emirate television displayed various banners showing a fictitious name for the Persian Gulf during the match between Iran's Sepahan and the UAE's Al Ain. The AFC must take serious measures to deal with UAE actions of the sort", Taj added. "The UAE side must be fined for showing a fictitious name for the Persian Gulf during the live broadcast of the match."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=125379&amp;sectionid=351020101 No Operation]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to official comments from the UAE in regards to comparing the three disputed islands of [[Greater Tunb]], the [[Lesser Tunb]] and [[Abu Musa]], held by Iran, to the [[occupation of Palestine]], calls were made for a downgrade of ties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=135944&amp;language=en Al-ManarTV:: Iran Set to Limit Ties with UAE over “Occupation”‌ Claims 03/05/2010]&lt;/ref&gt; This also comes after the [[Islamic Solidarity Games]], to be held in Iran, were canceled over the dispute of the ''Persian Gulf'' label.

===Club football===
In Germany, the occasional matchup between [[FC St. Pauli]] and [[F.C. Hansa Rostock]] is known as the "Political Derby" (German: ''Politisches Derby''). Though not a local derby, these teams' supporters represent opposite sides of Germany's political spectrum.{{which|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesligatalk.com/the-political-derby-radical-left-3-2-hard-right/323 |title=The Political Derby: Radical Left 3-2 Hard Right &amp;#124; World Soccer Talk &amp;#124; Page 323 |publisher=Bundesligatalk.com |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbysieg.com/hansa-rostock-und-sankt-pauli-ein-politisches-derby/ |title=Hansa Rostock und Sankt Pauli ein politisches Derby |publisher=Derbysieg |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]] is well known as a leader of a political movement called [[Corinthians Democracy]] (Portuguese: Democracia Corinthiana) and became a symbol against the military dictatorship happening at the time in the country in the 1980s. Claiming for an electoral democracy, every decision made by the club was done by voting by the squad players with the consent of the board of directors. Footballer [[Sócrates]] is considered one of the leaders of the movement,this movement is reemerging as the political party, the [[CORINTHIAN NATIONAL PARTY]] (Portuguese: Partido Nacional Corinthiano - PNC), in which its leader and President is Juan Antonio Moreno Grangeiro.

In Israel, [[Beitar Jerusalem]] are infamously known for their [[Jewish nationalism]], particularly against the first [[Arab-Israeli]] team to win the national cup, [[Bnei Sakhnin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/ar/originals/2013/12/israel-sports-racism-soccer-beitar-jerusalem-bnei-sakhnin.html#|title=Knesset member tries to shut out Arab-Israeli soccer club - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; conversely [[Maccabi Haifa]] is known for its cross-community support, particularly in its support by Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/26/israelandthepalestinians.sport|title=How racism is holding back Arab footballers|author=James Montague|work=the Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the women's game, [[Hapoel Petah Tikva]] have recruited Arab players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/sports/1.587049|title=Israeli Soccer Team Breaks New Ground: Recruits Arab Women|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the [[Old Firm]] rivalry between Glasgow-based clubs [[Celtic F.C.]] and [[Rangers F.C.]] is politically tinged along sectarian lines with [[Roman Catholic]]s in Scotland and Ireland supporting the former and [[Protestant]], mainly [[Presbyterian]]s, supporting the latter. It is arguably elevated by the [[Northern Ireland conflict]].

[[Athletic Bilbao]] are famous for the ''[[cantera]]'' policy of signing only [[Basque people|Basque]] players. Along with fellow Basque side [[Real Sociedad]], Bilbao raised the still banned [[Ikurriña|Basque flag]] in a game shortly after the death of General [[Francisco Franco]].

In France, [[SC Bastia]] fans display various symbols of [[Corsican nationalism]] at [[Stade Armand Cesari]], like [[Dio vi Salvi Regina]] and the "Testa di Moro" on the club crest; during [[2015 Coupe de la Ligue Final]] held in the [[Stade de France]] 30.000 Corsicans sang chants in their own dialect, similar to Sardinian dialect. 
[[Stade Rennais]] fans of Roazhon Celtic Kop display and are inspired by [[Breton Nationalism]] : [[Bro Gozh ma Zadoù]] is played before every match.

==Bandy==
Norway declined to take part in the [[1957 Bandy World Championship]] because the Soviet Union was invited, due to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] the year before. The country made a similar protest for the [[1969 Bandy World Championship]] because of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] that year, handing over the hosting of the 1969 event to Sweden.

Ukraine declined to take part in the [[2015 Bandy World Championship]] hosted by Russia because of the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation of Crimea]] the year before, since Ukraine still considers Crimea as part of its territory.

==Boxing==
[[List of heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight champion]] [[Max Schmeling]] had been lauded by the [[Nazi Party]] as a heroic symbol of German destiny and [[Aryan]] supremacy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A politically charged [[boxing]] match with [[Joe Louis]] was preceded nationalistic symbolism and imagery.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Schmeling defeated Louis, for the latter's first professional defeat in 1936. [[Langston Hughes]] recalled the national reaction to Louis' defeat.
{{Centered pull quote|I walked down Seventh Avenue and saw grown men weeping like children, and women sitting in the curbs with their head in their hands. All across the country that night when the news came out that Joe was knocked out, people cried. – Langston Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Langston (2002). Joseph McLaren. ed. ''Autobiography: The Collected Works of Langston Hughes'', Vol. 14. University of Missouri Press. p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schmeling was, however, welcomed home with a jubilant reaction. Hitler sent his wife flowers with the message: "For the wonderful victory of your husband, our greatest German boxer, I must congratulate you with all my heart." Schmeling responded to the accolades saying: "At this moment I have to tell Germany, I have to report to the Führer in particular, that the thoughts of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Führer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colours."&lt;ref name="bookreview"&gt;David Margolick, "Beyond Glory."&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling|rematch]] was scheduled later in New York City. In the build-up to the event U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] offered his support: "Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany." Schmeling's hotel was picketed by American protestors after an accompanying Nazi Party publicist declared that a black man could not defeat Schmeling and that when he won, his prize money would be used to build German tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Dettloff, William. "The Louis-Schmeling Fights: Prelude to War."&lt;/ref&gt; Louis won the rematch in a first round knock out and he became the focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to World War II. Louis later recalled the pressure on him before the fight: "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending me."&lt;ref name="bookreview"/&gt;

Decades later, [[Muhammad Ali]] took up political causes in his refusal to be [[conscription|drafted]] for the [[Vietnam War]] amid the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the presidency of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

After earning the championship, Clay converted his religion to Islam, which instigated conflict with his boxing career. He also abandoned his name that was given to his slave ancestors and adopted Muhammad Ali. On April 28, 1967, he refused to serve in the Army during the Vietnam War, stating religious reasons that it goes against the Qur'an's teaching.
{{Centered pull quote|I ain't got no quarrel with those Vietcong...no Vietcong ever called me nigger. - Muhammad Ali}}
He then became an icon of not only the civil rights struggle, but also the anti-Vietnam War movement.
However he was convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to five years in prison, fined $10,000 and stripped of his championship. It was not until a lawsuit in 1970 that Ali redeemed his title.
He would continue in historical boxing matches now known as [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in 1974 and [[Thrilla in Manila]] in 1975, defeating George Foreman and Joe Frazier, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/sport/muhammad_ali.html|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|work=Biography Online|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chess==

[[Chess]], which is a recognized sport of the [[International Olympic Committee]], has a history of being linked to political issues.  This was particularly true of the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 World Championship match]] between the American [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]] of the Soviet Union. The match took place during the [[Cold War]] and the pressure was mounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3669446/How-Bobby-Fischer-and-Boris-Spassky-became-pawns.html|title=How Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky became pawns|date=22 November 2007|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
{{further|Cricket Diplomacy}}

In 1969, the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] refused to allow [[Basil D'Oliveira]] to play for [[England cricket team|England]] against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] for fear of upseting the [[apartheid]] regime. D'Oliveira was a [[coloured]] born in South Africa and refused permission to play for the South African team by the government, instead he played for England. D'Oliveria was one of the more likely players to be selected following his performance against Australia in the previous year's [[The Ashes|Ashes]]. However, he was not selected; it was suspected at the time{{by whom|date=June 2012}} that this was capitulation towards the [[apartheid]] regime.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Cricket has also had a hand to play in sporting diplomacy. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General [[Zia ul-Haq]], attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, following a fifteen-year lull in test matches, cricket tours between India and Pakistan were revived in 2004 in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110004862|title=Life|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/03/10/business/singh.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General [[Pervez Musharraf]] came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged "to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/17/content_434859.htm Musharraf visits India amid cricket diplomacy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-04/19/content_435617.htm|title=India, Pakistan cricket diplomacy no game it's real|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. A Pakistani fan in [[Karachi]] ran onto the pitch to attack the Indian [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], and fans threw stones at the Indian players during the match in Karachi. In 2000 right-wing Hindus dug up the cricket pitch in New Delhi to protest against the Pakistani team's visit.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"&gt;[http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm UNU Update: Cricket Diplomacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821122824/http://update.unu.edu/archive/issue31_2.htm |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Kargil conflict]], and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.&lt;ref name="ipatrix"/&gt;

In reference to immigrants from the Caribbean and South Asia, British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] member [[Norman Tebbit]] once a "[[cricket test]]" could adjudge a persons loyalty to England by determining whether or not they supported the England and Wales cricket team ahead of those from their own countries of origin.

In 2008, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] cancelled [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]]'s 2009 tour of England and suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|2008 Zimbabwean presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=England cut Zimbabwe cricket ties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7471238.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MPs [[Jack Straw]] and [[Tessa Jowell]] wrote to the [[International Cricket Council]] asking then to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/4170262.stm | work=BBC News | title=Zimbabwe is facing new ban threat | date=August 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China have also gotten in on the cricket diplomacy act. [[Cross-Strait relations]] have once again been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]], [[Antigua]] received a $55 million grant to build the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], while Jamaica received $30 million for a new [[Greenfield Stadium (Trelawny)|Trelawny]] stadium. [[St. Lucia]] have also got both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, a massive amount compared to the [[International Cricket Council]]'s paltry 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket ''globally''. It is said that the motive for China's generosity is because "Most of the remaining countries that recognize Taiwan are located in the Caribbean and Latin America." The diplomacy paid off in the end as [[Grenada]] and [[Dominica]] derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. Further, "Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket." Grenada previously had a stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan.

Put on the back foot, a beleaguered Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and $12 million to the even smaller [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the [[Caribbean Islands]] as "Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door." And that "Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=2980988&amp;page=1|title=China Outplays Taiwan in Cricket Diplomacy|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of [[Saeed Anwar]]'s daughter he took to a more [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamental Islam]] and started growing a beard. He was then said to have been the turning point in the [[Islamisation]] of the Pakistani cricket team,&lt;ref name="cricinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/219991.html|title=Finding Faith|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also a reason for [[Yousuf Youhana]]'s conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/sep/17youhana.htm|title=Youhana embraces Islam|date=17 September 2005|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]] a more visible trend of religion was seen in the Pakistan team with many players having become more devout to the point of either leading prayers or growing beards as a symbol of being a "good Muslim" (with the notable exception of [[Shoaib Akhtar]] and [[Danish Kaneria]] (the latter being the only [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindu]] on the team)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?t=77299|title=PakPassion.net - Pakistan Cricket Forum|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even post-match interviews were preceded by Islamic salutations such as ''Bismillah ur Rehman rahim''.&lt;ref name="cricinfo"/&gt; Most famously, after the loss to [[India versus Pakistan cricket rivalry|arch-rival India]] at the 2007 [[ICC World Twenty20]] [[Shoaib Malik]] came under fire for apologising "I want to thank everyone back home in Pakistan and Muslims all over the world. Thank you very much and I’m sorry that we didn’t win, but we did give our 100 per cent" for the defeat, which was particularly ironic considering [[Irfan Pathan]], a [[Islam in India|Muslim]] was named [[Man of the Match]] for his performance in India's win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?235722|title='Indian Media Exploited Shoaib Remark'|work=outlookindia.com/|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shah Rukh Khan]] was in the stands cheering on India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pratyush.instablogs.com/entry/shoaibs-remark-shows-pakistani-cricket-team-a-victim-of-pan-islamic-influenza/ Instablogs - Mobile - Shoaib's remark shows Pakistani team a victim of pan-Islamic influenza]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2007 World Cup and the loss to Ireland (an unranked cricket team), the religious influence was criticised for taking a toll on the team. The Islamisation of such a Western sport in Pakistan was seen as symbolic of the growing influence of religion in every field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statestimes.com/2010/2010/03/16/islamisation-of-pakistan-cricket%E2%80%8F/ Islamisation of Pakistan cricket]&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, this trend was attributed to dating back to the tenure of the military government of General Zia-ul Haq where the focus of the youth was shifted from Pakistan as a nation-state and cultural-religious pluralism to Islam as a transnational [[Politics of identity|identity]], greater attention to conservative Islamic ritualism, and a perception of a global conspiracy against Muslims and admiration for militancy. A need was also seen to reorient sportsmen towards professionalism, discipline and rules and regulations. It was said that the focus of education and socialisation needed to return to a Pakistan that could not afford to be at war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C02%5C07%5Cstory_7-2-2010_pg3_2|title=DailyTimes - Your Right To Know|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics in the Olympics}}

Going as far back as the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], [[Adolf Hitler]] used this as a stage to promote [[Nazism and race|Aryan nationalism]] for Germany with his ideological belief of racial supremacy.&lt;ref name="Bachrach"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachrach|first=Susan D.|title=The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936|isbn=978-0-316-07087-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympics were used as a method of hardening the German spirit and instilling unity among German youth. It was also believed that sport was a "way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/olympics/zcb013.htm Nazification of Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many Jews and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] were banned from participating in sporting events. While Germany did top the medal table, the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] depiction of [[List of African ethnic groups|ethnic Africans]] as inferior was dispelled by [[Jesse Owens]]' [[gold medal]]s in the [[100 metres|100m]], [[200 metres|200m]], 4 × 100 m [[Relay race|relay]] and [[long jump]] events.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson, Judith Pinkerton.

Once again, in 1968, the global stage of the Olympics was used to show the world the plight of the [[African-American]] struggle during the [[civil rights movement]] in their home country. The famous [[Black Power]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|salute]] was performed by [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during the medal ceremony in [[Mexico City]].

In the [[1984 Los Angeles Olympics]] the [[Soviet Bloc]] led a [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|retaliatory boycott]] of the games in response to the American-led Moscow games boycott.

Following the [[Wrestling at the Olympics|cancellation of wrestling]] at the Olympics in the 2010s, traditional political rivals Iran, Russia and the United States joined forces to annul the measure. The U.S. hosted a publicity event in New York City with athletes from all three countries to campaign for its reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/americas/2013/05/201351643459549559.html|title=Global rivals unite to save Olympic wrestling|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main| Ping Pong Diplomacy}}
In the 1970s an exchange of table tennis players from the United States and the People's Republic of China led to a thaw in [[Sino-American relations]] that eventually led to U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[rapprochement]] with China.
It all began when the Chinese table tennis team invited their U.S. counterparts to their country on an all-expense paid trip during the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships]] in Japan. ''[[Time magazine]]'' termed it: "The ping heard ‘round the world.'" On April 10, 1971, the team, and accompanying journalists, became the first U.S. sports delegation to enter and break the information blockade since 1949. Although the U.S. team was defeated by their hosts, in return to Premier [[Chou En-lai]]'s invitation to more U.S. journalists, the United States government announced that it would lift its 20-year embargo on trade with China.
A reporter for ''Time'' noted that table tennis was "an apt metaphor for the relations between Washington and Peking" and that both state motioned a willingness to adapt to the new initiative. However, it was not until July 15, that Nixon would finally be the first U.S. president to pay a visit to China. Thirty-six years later, a three-day "Ping-Ping Diplomacy" event was held at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] during the week of June 9, 2008. The original members of the U.S. and Chinese teams from 1971 were present to participate at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/china/peopleevents/pande07.html|title=American Experience|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==
In 2008, Israeil tennists [[Shahar Pe'er]], [[Tzipi Obziler]], [[Andy Ram]] and [[Yoni Erlich]] were supposed to feature in [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournaments in Doha and Dubai, respectively, despite bans on Israeli passport holders from entering both countries.&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt; Peer was refused a visa to Dubai the following year following the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] with the organisers saying "We do not wish to politicise sport but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the whole region and not alienate or put at risk the players or the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have in the United Arab Emirates." The WTA chief executive [[Larry Scott (sports administrator)|Larry Scott]] later reacted saying some "sanctions" would be issued on Dubai. She also faced protests following the war during a tournament in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7891164.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dubai faces censure over Peer ban | date=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|2010 US Open]] tennis tournament India's [[Rohan Bopanna]] and Pakistan's [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]] reached the men's doubles finals, eliciting responses from political leaders in both countries. Supporters from both countries, including the respective United Nations ambassadors, sat in the stands together. Rashid Malik, Pakistan's [[Davis Cup]] coach, said "The success of their team so far has been a big encouragement for both countries, it will only have a peaceful and positive impact on their people." [[Manohar Singh Gill]], India's sports minister, asked "I have one question for everyone. If Bopanna and Qureshi can play together, why cannot India and Pakistan?"

The two were also involved in another campaign promoted by the Monaco-based ''Peace and Sport'' when they wore sweat shirts with slogans reading "Stop War, Start Tennis." They refer to themselves as the "Indo-Pak Express." Such a high-profile collaboration meant this was read as a "unique" partnership. Qureshi said "It just feels like us doing well on the bigger level is getting the message across throughout the world – if me and Rohan can get along so well there's no reason the Indians and Pakistanis can't get along with each other. If even two or three per cent of people say, 'If they can get along why can't we?' that's what we're trying to do. "They're all mixed together sitting in the crowd. You can't tell who is Pakistani and who is Indian. That's the beauty about sports. Before our pairing you would never see that in any sports, fighting for one cause. It's really good to be part of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/09/20109920244518342.html|title=Indo-Pak pair in tennis diplomacy|author=|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their finals defeat, Qureshi spoke to the crowd to "say something on behalf of all Pakistanis, [that] every time I come here, there's a wrong perception about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people. We want peace in this world as much as you guys." He then made a political appeal to the controversial "[[Ground Zero mosque]]" saying "For me, as a Muslim, that's what makes America the greatest country in the world - freedom of religion, freedom of speech. If the mosque is built, I think it's a huge gesture to all the Muslim community out there in the world. I would really appreciate it." Indian and Pakistani fans filled the stadium for the final as the two U.N. ambassadors again sat together in the President's Box. Pakistan's ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said "They've proven that when Indians and Pakistanis get together we can raise fire. I think on a people-to-people basis, they're setting an example that the politicians should follow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/09/11/2010-09-11_aisamulhaq_qureshi_delivers_message_of_peace_at_us_open_after_indopak_express_su.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi delivers message of peace at U.S. Open after Indo-Pak Express suffers defeat | first=Stefan | last=Bondy | date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{Main|Sporting boycott of South Africa}}
Most famously, the sporting boycott of [[apartheid South Africa|South Africa during Apartheid]] was said to have played a crucial role in forcing South Africa to open up their society and to end a global isolation.  South Africa was excluded from the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], and many sports' governing bodies expelled or suspended membership of South African affiliates.  It was said that the "international boycott of apartheid sport has been a powerful means for sensitising world opinion against apartheid and in mobilising millions of people for action against that despicable system." This boycott "in some cases helped change official policies."

The South African [[Table Tennis]] Board (SATTB), a body founded in contravention to the white South African table tennis board, was replaced for the latter by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]]. While the SATTB team was able to participate in the world championships held in [[Stockholm]] in 1957, team members were immediately refused passports by the government. It ruled that no black could compete internationally except through the white sports body.

Started in 1980, the United Nations "Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa" – a record of sports exchanges with South Africa and a list of sportsmen who have participated in sports events in South Africa – prove to be an effective instrument to discourage collaboration with apartheid sport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802160811/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html |date=August 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706195754/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s South Africa was also expelled from most international sports bodies. The [[International Olympic Committee]] even adopted a declaration against "apartheid in sport" on June 21, 1988, for the total isolation of apartheid sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/SPORT/SPORTRAM.htm|title=SPORTS AND THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/3/477|title=Hitting Apartheid for Six?

The country's hosting and winning of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] was a powerful boost to post-apartheid South Africa's return to the international sporting scene.&lt;ref name="update.unu.edu"/&gt; The [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa also drew similar parallels and questions as to whether race could be overcome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa/2010/06/07/freshly-ground-south-africa-0 Freshly ground South Africa | Al Jazeera Blogs]&lt;/ref&gt; this was especially true following the death of [[Eugene Terreblanche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8602347.stm | work=BBC News | title=South African Terreblanche killed | date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans of [[NASCAR]] are generally considered by the [[media of the United States]] to fall within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] base as an "almost exclusively white, conservative racing crowd", the "white, middle-aged, working-class Southern men" who were coveted in the first decades of 21st century during electoral campaigns. [[Joe Gibbs]], a NASCAR [[Joe Gibbs Racing|team owner]], spoke at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/opinion/09/26/s.e.cupp.book/index.html NASCAR.COM - Politics once again puts NASCAR fans center stage] Sept 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 90 percent of political contributions from those affiliated with NASCAR go to Republican candidates.

A study of elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the overall results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent, while a loss had the opposite effect. The study looked at [[NCAA]] football games from 1946 to 2008. In addition, the study found that colleges with higher attendance rates had a larger effect on the results, up to 3%. The effects are increased even further if the game is an [[upset (sports)|upset]], that is, if the team expected to win does not. Other studies have confirmed these results for other sports, such as [[baseball]] and [[basketball]]. The study authors concluded that the win made voters feel better about society, boosting votes for the incumbent, while losses made voters feel worse, sending votes to the challenger. There was some speculation that the result of certain games could even decide the [[2012 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate.com]] |date=October 24, 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States elections, 2010]], at least five former athletes ran on Republican tickets for political office. [[Chris Dudley]] took part in his first political race for [[Governor of Oregon]] after playing for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. He also helped persuade former [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' [[Jon Runyan]] to run for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district against a first-term Democrat [[John Adler]]. [[Shawn Bradley]] of the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] ran for a seat in Utah's legislature; [[Keith Fimian]], who played for the [[Cleveland Browns]], sought a House seat from Virginia; and former [[Washington Redskins]]' [[Clint Didier]] sought a Republican nomination for Senate in Washington state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-17/professional-athletes-become-republican-hopefuls-in-strategy-for-november.html | work=Bloomberg | title=NFL, NBA Provide Recruiting Ground for Republicans in November | date=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Runyan won his election.

&lt;!--The President also throws the ceremonial first pitch every year in baseball--&gt;Baseball players union boss [[Don Fehr]] contributed to the presidential primaries for [[George W.

Former Buffalo Bills quarterback [[Jack Kemp]] was a nine term congressman who chaired the House Republican Leadership Conference and served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George H. W. Bush. Kemp was the 1996 Republican candidate for Vice President. 
[[Bill Bradley]], who played basketball for the New York Knicks, served three terms in the U.S. Senate representing New Jersey.

Olympic gold medalist [[Carl Lewis]] planned to run for office from [[New Jersey]], though his attempt was blocked and he awaited an appeal hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/carl-lewis-files-federal-lawsuit-after-official-halts-bid-for-n-j-senate.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=David | last1=Voreacos | first2=Esme E. | last2=Deprez | title=Olympian Carl Lewis Sues After New Jersey Official Halts State Senate Bid | date=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[US State Department]] initiated a sports exchange programme entitled ''[[SportsUnited]]'' to encourage dialogue between children from the ages of 7–17. The programme seeks to bring together international students with their counterparts in the U.S. to establish links with American professional athletes and to expose them to American culture. Another programme encourages U.S. athletes to travel to and learn about foreign cultures and the challenges young people face in other countries.

===North Korea===

====World Cup====

North Korea's relationships with the international community, especially [[South Korea]], have sometimes been shaped by sports diplomacy. In the [[1966 World Cup]], North Korea defeated the heavily favored Italian team.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Jon. "Chollima Upset Italy." ESPNFC.com. ESPN, 19 July 2012. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Jong-il]] believed that successful athletics increases the strength of a country, promoted its ideology, brought a country great honor and increased its international reputation.&lt;ref name="Kim 1986"&gt;Kim, Jung Il. On Popularizing Physical Training and Sport and Developing Sporting Skills Rapidly: Talk to the Officials in the Field of Physical Training and Sport, May 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, this victory has become propaganda used by the North Korean regime to present a reputable country to not only their citizens, but also to the international community as a whole. Although North Korea has not had much success since this victory, North Korea participated in the [[2010 World Cup]]. In addition, North Korea was surrounded by controversy during [[2006 World Cup]] qualifying. Fan violence in Pyongyang after a match with Iran led to North Korea playing a home game in [[Thailand]] without any fans.&lt;ref&gt;"North Korea Football Violence Erupts." BBC News. BBC, 30 Mar. 2005. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;

====1988 Seoul Olympics====

The years leading up to, during, and after the [[1988 Seoul Olympics]] played a major role in the development of North Korea. In 1981, [[Seoul]] was selected as the host of the 1988 Olympics. Although at first, North Korea did not consider that Seoul being selected as Olympic host was a major issue, it quickly realized that South Korea hosting the Olympics would highlight the growing economic imbalances between North and South Korea.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"&gt;Armstrong, Charles K. ''Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950–1992''. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization led to a large devotion of time and effort in an attempt to convince the [[International Olympic Committee]] to split the Olympic Games between Seoul and [[Pyongyang]]. During these discussions, the IOC considered some concessions, only to be rejected by the North Korean regime. This can be seen as a great missed opportunity for North Korea to gain from the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="Radchenko, Sergey 2012"&gt;Radchenko, Sergey. "It's Not Enough to Win: The Seoul Olympics and the Roots of North Korea's Isolation." The International Journal of the History of Sport 29.9 (2012): 1243-262. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, North Korea's major allies were China, the [[USSR]], and [[Cuba]]. While [[Fidel Castro]] and Cuba staunchly defended North Korea, both the USSR and China agreed to participate in the games. This major decision strained relationships that were vital to the North Korean economic system.&lt;ref name="Radchenko, Sergey 2012"/&gt; Throughout the history of North Korea, North Korea relied heavily on the [[foreign aid]]. The countries that gave the most aid were the USSR and China. For that reason, the strained relationships had a major effect on North Korea. This played a major role in the North Korean isolationist policies of the 1990s. In addition, as a result of the undeniable success of the Seoul Games, the growing gap between these two nations was further put on display.

As a result of the failed negotiations North Korea engaged in several acts of [[terrorism]]. In 1987, in an attempt to destabilize the Olympic Games and instill fear in the international community, a South Korean commercial flight, [[Korean Air Flight 858]] was bombed killing 115 passengers on board.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"/&gt; This event did not fulfill its intended purpose and instead further weakened North Korea's international reputation.

====World Festival of Youth and Students====

North Korea, following its unsuccessful effort to sabotage the Seoul Olympics decided to hold the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in 1989. Coming one year after the most successful Olympics in years, there was large pressure on the North Korean regime to hold a similarly successful event. Although this event brought in 177 countries, the greatest number in its history, it was never seen as a true alternative to the Olympics and did not gain the international visibility that the North Korean government had hoped for.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, Charles K 1992"/&gt; In addition, the cost of the event was a staggering 4 billion dollars and helped further push North Korea into the financial distress that was so prevalent during the 1990s.

====Arirang Festival====

The [[Arirang Festival]], starting in the early 2000s takes place in the [[Rungrado 1st of May Stadium]], the largest stadium in the world holding approximately 150,000 people. Participation in this event is mandatory and the performances are extravagant and impressively choreographed.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"&gt;Merkel, Udo. "The Politics of Sport and Identity in North Korea." The International Journal of the History of Sport 31.3 (2014): 376-90. Taylor &amp; Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arirang Festival can be broken up into three different parts. The first is a floor show, where thousands of athletes, gymnasts and dancers demonstrate their athletic abilities. The second section uses thousands of North Koreans to create a human mosaic depicting vibrant images of North Korea and North Korean achievements. Finally, the third section is the music that links the performance.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt; Together, these elements present to the international community North Korea's best athletes through a mix of athletics and art. The Arirang Festival draws international tourists and journalists and intends to present a thriving economic nation to the world. Many of the acts in the festival focus on the theme of reunification. Children chant "how much longer do we have to be divided due to foreign forces". The 2014 and 2015 Arirang Festivals were canceled and it is unknown if it will return.

====Recent relations with South Korea====

North Korea and South Korea marched together for the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]], [[2004 Athens Olympics]] and [[2006 Turin Olympics]]. Plans to walk together for the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] fell through when principles regarding selection of athletes could not be agreed upon. After the 2008 Beijing Olympics tensions have increased between these two nations.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt;

Many inter-Korean sporting events were held in the 2000s. These events were referred to as unification matches.&lt;ref name="Merkel, Udo 2014"/&gt;

====Internal use of sports politics====

The North Korean leaders understood the importance of sports not only in the international community, but also internally. The major ideology in North Korea, [[Juche]], has been solidified through the Communist Party's use of sports.&lt;ref name="Kim 1986"/&gt; The North Korea regime believed that by supporting the increases in sport, the North Korean people would overall be more fit. This would allow the people to be more useful in the revolutionary struggle. For this reason, it was important to start athletics young. In fact, training in physical sport was mandatory during schooling. In the 2000s, major sporting events were being broadcast throughout North Korea, and these events are still being used as propaganda tools. Sports have played a vital role in maintaining the power of the ruling class, while at the same time offering opportunities to interact with the international community.

===Brazil===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

====Corinthian Democracy====

The most famous incident in Brazilian soccer and politics is [[Corinthians Democracy]]. In 1982, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], a club in [[São Paulo]], held election of the club. Unlike other club elections, the presidency of the club was considered as the “third most important position in the country, after the governorship of Sao Paulo and the presidency of the Republic.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertisements through televisions, radio, music etc., that added up to around 500,000 U.S. dollars were used. There were two opposing sides, “Corinthian Democracy” and “Order and Truth”, that contested for the place. “Corinthian Democracy” aimed for political liberation within the club and “Order and Truth” remained in the old system, the oligarchy. [[Sócrates]], the former soccer player, made a statement that he would stay in Corinthians if free election amendment passes. Corinthian Democracy was defeated after the free-elections campaign’s defeat and Socrates went to Florence as a result. 

====World Cup in 1970====

After Brazil won the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1970, General [[Emílio Garrastazu Médici|Emílio Médici]]’s government declared a national holiday, rewarding each player with the equivalent amount of 18,500 U.S. dollars, tax-free. Medici declared “I identify this victory, achieved in the fraternity of sport, with the ascension of faith in our struggle for national development.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt;. Opinion Poll in 1970 stated that “90 percent of Brazil’s lower classes identified soccer with the nation.”&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, Matthew. "Playing Soccer in Brazil: Socrates, Corinthians, and Democracy." The Wilson Quarterly (1976-) 13, no. 2 (1989): 119-23. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40257497.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the victory in 1970, [[Cláudio Coutinho]] who was the manager of the national team was given a mission to modernize the Brazilian playing style. Instead of individual skills, teamwork and discipline were emphasized as Medici’s government made efforts to modernize the Brazilian economy.

====Protests over 2014 World Cup Spending====

In the summer of 2013 as Brazil prepared to host the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], protests about an increase in the cost of public transportation broke out.&lt;ref&gt;Young, James. "How Soccer Culture Made Its Way Into Brazils Political Crisis." Remezcla. 2016, Retrieved March 7 2018, http://remezcla.com/features/sports/soccer-brazil-political-crisis/.&lt;/ref&gt; Although started with a small cause, the protests soon expanded to discontents over government’s spending on social welfare. Protestors requested, “hospitals and schools abiding by FIFA standards.”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; This request was a “reference to FIFA’s high standards of stadium quality” when the country only spends 5 percent of GDP on education in comparison. However, [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima]], former soccer player for Brazil, stated that “World Cups aren’t made with hospitals”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;, referring to a disconnect between soccer stadium and spending on social welfare. This tension led up to a spending of US$850 million on security for the World Cup, which was five times higher than the amount spent by South Africa. 

After the official matches began, political activities, such as protests, reduced until the semi-finals. Brazil, considered as a strong candidate to win the World Cup, lost to Germany [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7-1]].  As Sarah Fellay referred, huge defeat against Germany sparked “a flood of protests across the country.”&lt;ref&gt;Fellay, Sarah. “Saved by the Goalkeeper: Soccer and Elections.” Harvard International Review, vol. 36, no. 1, 2014, pp. 32–35., www.jstor.org/stable/43649245, Retrieved 6 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; Through social media and other online formats, Brazilians started to denounce the government publicly, referring to past protests. Não vai ter Copa (there will be no cup), which was a slogan to denounce government’s spending on the World Cup, started to recur on social media. As a result, President [[Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff]]’s approval ratings fell.
 
====Corruption====

[[Brazilian Football Confederation]], the CBF, has been accused of being under the influence of corruption. U.S. Justice Department investigated CBF former presidents for their corruption. In December 2017, [[José Maria Marin]], former CBF president, was found guilty of taking US$6.5 million in bribes.&lt;ref&gt;Laughland, Oliver. “Fifa Trial: Two Ex-Soccer Officials Found Guilty on Multiple Charges of Corruption.” The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 22 Dec. 2017, Retrieved April 4 2018. www.theguardian.com/football/2017/dec/22/fifa-trial-two-ex-officials-found-guilty-on-multiple-charges-of-corruption.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo Del Nero|Marco Polo del Nero]], also a former president of CBF, is currently under provisional suspension since December 2017 by FIFA due to investigations on his bribery.&lt;ref&gt;“Provisional Suspension of Football Official Marco Polo Del Nero Extended for 45 Days by Independent Ethics Committee .” FIFA.com, 14 Mar. 2018, Retrieved 3 April 8 2018, www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2018/m=3/news=provisional-suspension-of-football-official-marco-polo-del-nero-extended-for-45-.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arena Corinthians]], where the opening match of 2014 World Cup was held, was referred in an investigation of [[Petrobras]] corruption of “money-laundering operation.” Also, in the construction of [[Arena das Dunas]] stadium in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], Brazilian investigators found “a total of US$23.4 million was used as a source of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;Paraguassu, Lisandra. “Brazil Police Arrest Former Minister in World Cup Stadium Probe.” Reuters, Thomson Reuters, 6 June 2017, Retrieved April 3 2018, www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption/brazil-police-arrest-former-minister-in-world-cup-stadium-probe-idUSKBN18X129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sports, a '''revival''' is a new club or franchise is using a name or colours of a previously active team. The previously active team may be defunct, temporarily suspended or may have transferred its operations to another city. The new team may be a new team or franchise, or it may be a transferred team taking over a previous team's colours and/or name. Sports teams names or [[nicknames]] are copyrighted in North America and elsewhere. Therefore, permission often must be granted from the owner or family of the defunct team.

==Description==
Sports teams are organized in various ways and the term is used differently in different situations. A team can be simply not fielded for a season, but the parent organization still exists. A team and franchise can relocate to another city, and adopt a new nickname. At some point, sometimes decades later, a new team, with a new organization, then revives the team, name or colours in the original city. It may or may not be granted possession of the original team's history (team records, championships and the like)

===Simple suspension===
A team can be members of a sports association that fields several teams. A team at one level may be discontinued, then 'revived' in another year, such as the Central Plains Junior hockey team in 2012, after the team did not field a team in the AAA midget bracket the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Portage Daily Graphic |title=Jr. Caps revived  |last=Falloon |first=Dan |date=September 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival in name only===
In professional sports in North America, there are several examples whereby a team relocated, taking its franchise and franchise history with it to the new city. The teams were renamed and used a new nickname. The ''revived'' teams were not granted possession of the old team's history.

;Major League Baseball
The [[Milwaukee Brewers]] are named after an earlier club, which relocated to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and eventually became the [[Baltimore Orioles]], and a minor-league club named the Brewers. The [[Baltimore Orioles]] are named after an earlier club, which relocated to [[New York, New York]] and became the [[New York Yankees]]. The [[Washington Nationals]] are named after an earlier club, which relocated to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and became the [[Minnesota Twins]].

;National Hockey League (NHL)
The [[Ottawa Senators]] [[ice hockey]] team is named after an earlier [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Senators]] ice hockey team. Founded in 1883, the team was a member of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) from 1917 to 1934. After the 1933–34 season, the NHL franchise relocated to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The Ottawa Senators continued as a senior amateur, and later a professional, team until 1954. The founders of the current franchise received permission from the descendents of [[Tommy Gorman]], who owned the Senators in 1954, to use the name. The new Senators also adopted the colours of the original franchise.

In 2011, the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] were sold and relocated to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], where the team was renamed the [[Winnipeg Jets]]. The 'original' [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]] team existed from 1972 to 1996 until it moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in 1996 to become the [[Phoenix Coyotes]]. The Jets' team name and trademarks had reverted to the possession of the NHL after the move, although the franchise history (retired jerseys, team statistics) is continued by the Coyotes. While the new team revived the Jets name, new jerseys and team colours were developed.

===Franchise history reversions===
In two cases, a newly granted franchise has revived a team that was inactive, and has been granted the rights to the previous team's history:

The [[Cleveland Browns]] were a professional football team from 1946 until owner [[Art Modell]] moved the club to Baltimore in 1995. However, in a deal with the [[NFL]] and the City of Cleveland, the team was declared inactive for three years until a new expansion club, under the old name and colors, was established in 1999. The new Browns are considered a continuation of the old franchise.&lt;ref name="BAL-CLE_Deal"&gt;Morgan, Jon. [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-modell020996,1,1050941.story Deal clears NFL path to Baltimore], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', February 9, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Montreal Alouettes]] are named after an earlier franchise which became defunct in 1981. The [[Baltimore Stallions]], which were formed through expansion, relocated to Montreal after playing in Baltimore from 1994 until 1996. The CFL considers all clubs that have played in Montreal since [[1946 Montreal Alouettes season|1946]] as one franchise in their league records, including those of the original Alouettes (1946–1981), Montreal Concordes (1982–1985) and Montreal Alouettes (1986). The Alouettes and the CFL, however, do not recognize the Baltimore franchise, or its records, as part of the official team history.&lt;ref name="Grey Cup stats"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/by-the-numbers-grey-cup-glory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419014653/http://www.cfl.ca/article/by-the-numbers-grey-cup-glory |archivedate=2015-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1093">A '''riseball''' or '''dimple''' is a pitch thrown by a pitcher in [[fastpitch softball]].  Upon release by the pitcher, the ball has [[backspin]].  The backspin and velocity are two of the factors that cause the ball to rise.  

Baseball does not have a rise ball as as a ball thrown overhand can not defy gravity and rise.   

[[Jennie Finch]] is famous for striking out [[Major League Baseball]] players with this pitch. The riseball is in effect upside down to a curve ball thrown overhand. 

The movement of the ball is caused by the [[Magnus effect]].

[[Image:2007 Indianapolis 500 - Starting field formation before start.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cars in formation for a rolling start at the [[Indianapolis 500]].]]
A '''rolling start''' is one of two modes of initiating or restarting an [[motorsport|auto]] race; the other mode is the [[standing start]]. In a rolling start, the cars are ordered on the track and are led on a certain number of laps (parade or caution laps) at a pre-determined safe speed by the [[safety car]]. 

==Procedure==
When race conditions are ready, the safety car will leave the track, and the race marshal will show the green flag, indicating that the field is allowed to accelerate. The safety car typically leaves the track some distance before the finish line, and a few seconds may elapse between the safety car's departure and the showing of the green flag. Cars must wait for the green flag to accelerate to race speeds. In the past, drivers would need to look for the flag, but in modern times this information is typically communicated to drivers via [[two-way radio]], or at the proper acceleration zone, marked by a line or cone, determined at the pre-race drivers and mechanics briefing.

In international-level motorsport, races with rolling starts are typically started by the starter changing the starting lights from red to green after a specified number of green flag pace laps behind either a lead car or [[safety car]]. In this case the red lights are pre-illuminated part of the way around the final pace lap and are changed to green once the starter is happy with the composition of the field. International rolling starts may be aborted by leaving the red lights illuminated and the displaying of an "Extra Formation Lap" board and/or flashing yellow lights. 

Rolling starts are often accompanied by several rules to prevent drivers from getting an unfair advantage during the start of the race. For example, drivers on the inside line cannot overtake cars on the outside until they have passed the start line. Drivers must stay behind the pace car and maintain their position within the field, unless entering the pits or given leave to go around. Furthermore, as the green flag nears and the pace car exits the track, drivers must maintain speed and position heading to the proper line. The lead driver cannot slow excessively to force trailing cars to bunch up, which would give the leader a jump on the restart.

Motorsports utilising a rolling start include [[stock car racing]], [[sports car racing]], and several worldwide [[Touring car racing|touring car]] championships. Formula sports tend to avoid the rolling start for the initial start of the race, mostly because of the physics and technology behind the sport (for example, being too close to the car in front for too long can cause overheating and [[engine]] problems), but also because of the quicker acceleration times, and bigger dangers behind accidents within the sport.

The initial start of the race may organize the cars in specific lines. For instance, NASCAR races start double file, and the [[Indy 500]] starts triple file. Restarts, however, are often only single file, but lapped cars may form a second line on the inside.  Some short track ovals have a rule, adopted by NASCAR in June 2009, and INDYCAR in 2011, where the restarts are all double file, with the leader's choice of inside or outside on the ensuing restart.

Virtually all restarts in motorsports are held as rolling starts for time constraints; it is much quicker to get the cars to go on a rolling restart than a standing start (under the FIA Code, once a red flag is displayed, it takes ten minutes to restart a race via standing start). Formula One has a rule stating that in case of an excessively wet track, a rolling start may be used to start the race with the cars behind the safety car.  In such cases, laps start counting immediately.

Some [[Formula One]] races — 1997 and 2000 at Spa, Belgium, 2003 at Interlagos, Brazil, 2007 at Fuji, Japan, 2008 at Monza, Italy, 2009 at Shanghai, China, 2010 at Yeongam, South Korea, 2011 at Montreal, Canada, 2014 at Suzuka, Japan, and 2016 at Monaco and then Silverstone, Great Britain - started with a rolling start because of weather concerns. They were not proper rolling starts because they started the race behind the safety car and so when racing properly started, they took the line in single file.

Also, every time after the Safety Car is on the track, when it goes off, there is a rolling start.

The '''serpentine system''' is a method employed in the organization of a [[competition]] to define the [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeded]] teams and arrange them in pools. The ''n'' ranked teams that will be involved in the [[tournament]] are distributed in ''m'' pools according to the following [[algorithm]]:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="{ font-size:smaller; }"
|- bgcolor="#efefef" 
!Pool 1!!Pool 2!! . . . !!Pool ''m'' − 1!!Pool ''m''
|- align="center"
|1||2|| . . . ||''m'' − 1||''m''
|- align="center"
|2''m''||2''m'' − 1|| . . . ||''m'' + 2||''m'' + 1
|- align="center"
|2''m'' + 1||2''m'' + 2|| . . . ||3''m'' − 1||3''m''
|- align="center"
|...||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;
|}

For instance, 12 teams would be organized in four-team pools, according to the serpentine   system, as follows:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="font-size:smaller"
|- bgcolor="#efefef"
!Pool 1!!Pool 2!!Pool 3
|- align="center"
|1||2||3
|- align="center"
|6||5||4
|- align="center"
|7||8||9
|- align="center"
|12||11||10
|}

To improve competitivity, this method is sometimes used in conjunction with the [[Drawing straws|drawing of lots]] method: the serpentine system is used only for some of the teams involved in a competition ("seeds"); the rest is distributed in pools following a drawing of lots.

'''Slim Jeans''' was the name of a weight-reducing product heavily marketed in the [[Television in the United States|United States]] through [[television advertising|television commercials]] in the 1980s.  Slim Jeans were a pair of pants, very unlike [[jeans]] and more like [[sweatpants]], made of a silver reflective material.  They  were supposed to help the wearer lose weight by trapping [[body heat]] and promoting the loss of "water weight" through sweating.  Slim Jeans also came with a hooded sweatshirt made of the same material. The product and commercial, which became the subject of discussion on [[X-Entertainment]], are considered by some to be unintentionally comic.
[[Monty Python]] even parodied the product in their skit "Trim Jeans Theater".

The '''Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961''' affects [[Title 15 of the United States Code]], Chapter 32 "Telecasting of Professional Sports Contest" (§§ 1291-1295) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_32.html |title=15 U.S. Code Chapter 32 - TELECASTING OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CONTESTS &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=.law.cornell.edu |date=2012-01-03 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Sports Broadcasting Act was passed in response to a court decision which ruled that the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated [[competition law|antitrust laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shea|first=Stuart|date= |title=Calling the Game: Baseball Broadcasting from 1920 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5QcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=Calling+the+Game:+Baseball+Broadcasting+from+1920+to+the+Present&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij-OW6x4PWAhXIrlQKHU6TCQgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Gillette%20&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=SABR, Inc.|page=357|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court ruled that the "pooling" of rights by all the teams to conclude an exclusive contract between the league and [[CBS]] was illegal.

The Act overrules that decision, and permits certain joint broadcasting agreements among the major professional sports. It recognizes the fact that the various franchises in a sports league, while competitors in the sporting sense, are not as much business competitors as they are interdependent partners, whose success as enterprises is intertwined, as a certain level of competitive balance between them must exist for any of them to remain viable enterprises.  Therefore, it permits the sale of a television "package" to a network or networks in which the league members share equally, a procedure which is common today. Of the five major North American professional team sports, the Act is most pertinent to the NFL, as all of its regular-season and playoff games are covered by the rights assigned by its various packages with the networks, including its own.  

The law has been interpreted to include the so-called "blackout rules" which protect a home team from competing games broadcast into its home territory on a day when it is playing a game at home, and from having to broadcast games within its home market area that have not sold out.  It also, in effect, protects high school football and college football game attendance by blacking out pro football games locally on Friday evenings and Saturdays during those sports' regular seasons; these measures effectively outlawed the broadcasting (and, in practice, the playing) of NFL games on those days, since virtually all of the country is within 75 miles (120 km) of at least one high school game on every Friday night in September and October. 

===Exceptions===
This portion of the act has since been partially circumvented; the NFL extended its season in 1978 to allow a few weeks of Friday night or Saturday games if the league so wished. Late-season Saturday games have been common since then, but Friday night games are still extremely rare; the league has played only eight Friday games since 1978, mostly because of the NFL's restrictions during Christmas. (In 2005, a [[Miami Dolphins]]-[[Kansas City Chiefs]] matchup, scheduled for Sunday, October 23 in Miami, was moved up to 7pm Friday night due to [[Hurricane Wilma]]. The game was televised only in the South Florida and Kansas City TV markets, and was not seen nationally.)&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-10-20-chiefs-dolphins-moved_x.htm?csp=36&lt;/ref&gt;

===College football===
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA)'s broadcast packages are not subject to the antitrust exemption and it suffered for it, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the NCAA's restrictive television policies were a violation of antitrust law in the 1980s when the [[University of Georgia]] and the [[University of Oklahoma]] sued the NCAA over television restrictions (limit of six television appearances over two years) established in 1952. However, after their court victory, neither Georgia nor Oklahoma made serious efforts to market their own television packages, but instead followed the lead of their conferences, the [[Southeastern Conference]] and the [[Big 12 Conference|Big 8 Conference]] respectively.

The [[College Football Association]], an alliance of 64 schools from some of the major conferences and selected independents, sold their own television package in 1984, first to ABC, and later to CBS. The [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]] conferences, not CFA affiliates, sold their own separate package, to ABC.

By 1990, the landscape changed. ABC had both the CFA, Big Ten, and Pac-10 packages, and NBC the Notre Dame home package. It was once again relegated to limited appearances.

The CFA collapsed, and in 1995, the Southeastern Conference signed a national deal with CBS.  They are the only major conference guaranteed a national "game of the week" because ESPN's games may come from any of the conferences they offer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/jargon/ljsportsbroadcasingact.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102084416/http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/jargon/ljsportsbroadcasingact.htm |date=January 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current views on the Sports Broadcasting Act==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
In November 2006, former Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman [[Arlen Specter]], (&lt;!-- In 2006, Specter was a Republican--&gt;[[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Pennsylvania|PA]]) proposed legislation to repeal the NFL's antitrust exemption under the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961.

Specter's concern was based on the [[National Football League]]'s [[NFL Network]], which is available in a limited number of homes, as compared to the other broadcasters of the NFL.  For the 2006-07 NFL season, each NFL team annually earned more than $120 million in shared TV money. The league's officials negotiated various deals with CBS, [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[Disney]], and ended up with a six-year (later extended to eight), $24 billion broadcast and cable rights contract. The television deals ended in 2013. Additionally, [[DirecTV]] paid $700 million every year through 2010 for its Sunday Ticket package.  The NFL also decided to keep an eight-game Thursday-to-Saturday night package in-house, placing it on its [[NFL Network]].

Both the Sunday Ticket and NFL Network became issues of concern to Specter, possibly because [[DirecTV]] rival [[Comcast]] is headquartered in his home state of [[Pennsylvania]].  Comcast's [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] network attempted to bid for the eight-game package the NFL gave to their own network, but lost.

The NFL Network's high per-subscriber fees charged to the cable companies force cable firms to offer the channel as a premium-tier network.  This, according to the NFL, is unacceptable, and they demanded their channel be placed on a basic tier, as compared to the higher-priced sports tiers.  By doing so, cable companies would have to reduce the number of basic channels or increase the basic cable package rate to comply with the NFL's request. NFL rules however, require that NFL games shown on cable channels (including the NFL Network), be shown on a broadcast television station in the markets of the participating teams (subject to blackouts for the home team when necessary).

The other major concern is the lack of availability of NFL Sunday Ticket, restricting it severely through its exclusivity with DirecTV.  A similar situation happens with NASCAR HotPass, which moved from the cable companies to DirecTV in 2007, and thwarted by Major League Baseball's MLB Extra Innings, which MLB attempted to push to DirecTV exclusively starting in 2009, but was stopped by threats from legislators.

In what may have been a goodwill gesture to Senator Lautenberg of [[New Jersey]] and, in an effort to sway Specter, the NFL gave Time Warner and Cablevision subscribers a free week of programming between December 24 and December 30, 2006.  The timing allowed subscribers to tune into the Rutgers–Kansas State Texas Bowl matchup and another college bowl game featuring Minnesota and Texas Tech.  Lautenberg had complained that many Rutgers fans in New Jersey were being unfairly denied the opportunity to watch Rutgers in the Texas Bowl because the NFL Network, which has rights to the game, had not yet reached deals with Cablevision and Time Warner Cable.

A '''sports agent''' is a legal representative (hence [[agent (law)|agent]]) for professional sports figures such as athletes and coaches. They procure and negotiate employment and [[Testimonial|endorsement]] contracts for the [[principal (commercial law)|athlete or coach]] whom they represent.
Because of the unique characteristics of the [[sports industry]], sports agents are responsible for communications with team owners, managers, and other individuals.  Also, they are responsible for making recommendations in regard . In addition to finding income sources, agents often handle [[public relations]] matters for their clients. In some large sports agencies, such as [[International Management Group|IMG]], [[Creative Artists Agency]], Roc Nation Sports and [[Octagon (Sports Agency)|Octagon]], agents deal with all aspects of a client's finances, from investment to filing taxes.

Sports agents may be relied upon by their clients for guidance in all business aspects, and sometimes even more broadly.  For example, hockey agents start recruiting clients as young as 15, allowing the agent to guide the athlete's career before the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL Entry Draft|draft]], which happens usually at 18 years of age.

Due to the length and complexity of contracts, many sports agents are lawyers or have a background in contract law. Agents are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, business management, and financial and risk analysis, as well as sports. It is important for a sports agent to follow trends in sports. Other skills an agent must possess are excellent communication and negotiation skills. Agents must be highly motivated, willing to work long hours, and capable of multitasking. It is very common for agents to be in negotiations on behalf of several clients at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm Job Profiles.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109035912/http://www.jobprofiles.org/artsportsagent.htm |date=2010-01-09 }} – description of roles of sports agent and some educational programs to prepare for the field&lt;/ref&gt;

Some agents are part of large companies, and some are on their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2007/07/16/an-industry-of-conglomerates/ An Industry Of Conglomerates] Sports Agent Blog, July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The number of clients an individual agent can handle and how many clients his or her employing agency can handle in total are interdependent variables.

Before the 1990s, most [[association football|football]] players did not use agents. In some cases, they used their fathers as agents. Because of most parents' naivete about the football business, these young footballers were often given less-than-stellar contracts by football clubs, which yielded lower salaries than they thought they deserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article396507.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 "The Big Interview: Neil Webb"] ''Sunday Times'', Nov. 28, 2004, interview with soccer/football player&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, there were only three licensed agents in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html "Market Saturation of Agents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810181903/http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/article18746/Marknaden-mattad-pa-agenter.html |date=2011-08-10 }}, May 23, 2002, note: source can be translated into English on the website&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2002, there were 33.  According to [[FIFA]], there were 5,187 licensed association football agents worldwide, with 600 agents in Italy alone.&lt;ref&gt;[ FIFA – Players' agents list – by country]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, agents have not been licensed by FIFA. Instead, agents are now licensed directly by each association.

Sports agents generally receive between 4 and 10% of the athlete's playing contract, and 10 to 20% of the athlete's endorsement contract, although these figures vary. [[NFL]] agents are not permitted to receive more than 3%, and [[NBA]] agents not more than 4%, of their client's playing contracts.

==Media depictions==
The popularity of television shows such as ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', which stars a [[talent agent]] named [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]], and ''[[Arliss]]'', have helped glamorize the profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsagentblog.com/2008/12/04/so-you-want-to-be-an-agent-the-entourage-effect/ "So, You Want To Be An Agent? The Entourage Effect"] Sports Agent Blog, Dec. 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to that, movies such as ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', ''[[Two for the Money (2005 film)|Two for the Money]]'', and ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' depicted sports agents. In England, ITV's ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'' put a new spin on sports agents by casting a no-holds-barred female agent [[Hazel Bailey]]. The television show ''[[Ballers]]'', which started in 2015, also shows a strong depiction of sports agents.

Due to the popularity of these works, there has been increase of attention in the profession. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son decided to become a football agent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/blairs-son-to-become-a-football-agent-1829864.html "Blair's son to become a football agent"] Nov. 28, 2009, ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formerly active agencies===
Some sports agency firms were once prominent, but are now gone or reorganized:

* '''SFX Entertainment''' (now [[Live Nation]], a publicly traded company) –  in 1998 SFX agreed to pay up to $150 million in cash, stock, and bonuses for F.A.M.E., the sports agency run by [[David Falk]], the agent for basketball players [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Patrick Ewing]]. SFX also acquired two other major sports agencies, [[Arn Tellem]]'s agency (Tellem &amp; Associates) and the baseball-oriented firm run by [[Randy Hendricks]] and Allan Hendricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/28/sports/steinberg-sells-sports-firm.html |title="Steinberg Sells Sports Firm" New York Times October 28, 1999 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=October 28, 1999 |author= |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SFX would later reverse course, and sell off the pieces of its large sports agency business.
* '''Steinberg, Moorad &amp; Dunn''' ("SMD") – a multi-sport agency sold in October 1999 for reported $120 million to Canadian financial firm.  Defections of principals, and litigation, followed.

'''Strength training''' is a type of [[physical exercise]] specializing in the use of resistance to induce [[muscular contraction]] which builds the [[physical strength|strength]], [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic endurance]], and [[Muscle hypertrophy|size]] of [[skeletal muscle]]s.

When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased [[bone]], muscle, [[tendon]], and [[ligament]] strength and toughness, improved [[joint]] function, reduced potential for injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shaw| first = I. |author2=Shaw, B.S. | year = 2014| title = Resistance Training and the Prevention of Sports Injuries.

Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of [[:Category:Weight training equipment|equipment]] to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity, although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of [[aerobic exercise]] through [[circuit training]].

Strength training is typically associated with the production of lactate, which is a limiting factor of exercise performance. Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training. This is mediated via activation of PGC-1alpha which alter the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) isoenzyme complex composition and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA, while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Summermatter|first=Serge|last2=Santos|first2=Gesa|last3=Pérez-Schindler|first3=Joaquín|last4=Handschin|first4=Christoph|date=2013-05-21|title=Skeletal muscle PGC-1α controls whole-body lactate homeostasis through estrogen-related receptor α-dependent activation of LDH B and repression of LDH A|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8738–43|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212976110|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3666691|pmid=23650363|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.8738S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports where strength training is central are [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], [[Highland games]], [[shot put]], [[discus throw]], and [[javelin throw]]. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably [[tennis]], [[American football]], [[wrestling]], [[track and field]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[basketball]], [[pole dancing]], [[hockey]], [[professional wrestling]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], and [[soccer]]. Strength training for other sports and physical activities is becoming increasingly popular.

== Uses ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
The benefits of weight training include greater muscular strength, improved muscle tone and appearance, increased endurance and enhanced bone density.

=== Increased physical attractiveness ===
Many people take up weight training to improve their [[physical attractiveness]]. There is evidence that a body type consisting of broad shoulders and a narrow waist, attainable through strength training, is the most physically attractive male attribute according to women participating in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mautz|first=Brian S.|last2=Wong|first2=Bob B. M.|last3=Peters|first3=Richard A.|last4=Jennions|first4=Michael D.|date=2013-04-23|title=Penis size interacts with body shape and height to influence male attractiveness|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6925|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=110|issue=17|pages=6925–30|doi=10.1073/pnas.1219361110|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3637716|pmid=23569234|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6925M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most men can develop substantial muscles; most women lack the [[testosterone]] to do it, but they can develop a firm, "toned" (see below) physique, and they can increase their strength by the same proportion as that achieved by men (but usually from a significantly lower starting point). An individual's [[Genetics|genetic]] make-up dictates the response to weight training stimuli to a significant extent.  Training can not exceed a muscle's intrinsic genetically determined qualities though polymorphic expression does occur e.g., Myosin heavy chains&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Applications|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Metabolic Monitoring for Military Field|date=2004-01-01|title=Physiological Biomarkers for Predicting Performance|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215705/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies also show that people are able to tell the strength of men based on photos of their bodies and faces, and that physical appearance indicates cues of strengths that are often linked to a man's physical formidability and, therefore, his attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sell|first=Aaron|last2=Cosmides|first2=Leda|last3=Tooby|first3=John|last4=Sznycer|first4=Daniel|last5=Rueden|first5=Christopher von|last6=Gurven|first6=Michael|date=2009-02-07|title=Human adaptations for the visual assessment of strength and fighting ability from the body and face|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1656/575|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=276|issue=1656|pages=575–584|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.1177|issn=0962-8452|pmid=18945661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is aligned with studies that reveal those who undergo strength training attain more [[self-esteem]] and [[body cathexis]] when compared to individuals who do not undergo training or exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Resistance Training|last=Stone|first=Michael|last2=Stone|first2=Meg|last3=Sands|first3=William|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2007|isbn=9780880117067|location=Champaign, Illinois|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people who undergo strength training tend to have a more favorable [[body image]] even than those who also engage in regular [[Exercise|physical activities]] such as [[walking]] and [[running]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Body Image Workbook: An Eight-Step Program for Learning to Like Your Looks|last=Cash|first=Thomas|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781608826179|location=Oakland, CA|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; More women are also increasingly revealed to be dissatisfied with their body today than those surveyed in 1984 and they often turn to exercise such as strength training to improve their [[body shape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tighten Your Tummy in 2 Weeks: Lose up to 14 Inches &amp; 14 Pounds of Fat in 14 Days!|last=Darden|first=Ellington|publisher=Rodale|year=2015|isbn=9781623365714|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workouts elevate [[metabolism]] for up to 14 hours following 45-minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Shanely|first2=R.

=== Increased general physical health ===
Strength training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for [[joint]]s, and reduce the risk of [[injury]] from everyday activities. [[Old age|Older]] people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of muscle tissue that normally accompanies [[aging]]—and even regain some functional strength—and by doing so become less frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Gordon|first2=P. M.|year=2011|title=Resistance Exercise for the Aging Adult: Clinical Implications and Prescription Guidelines|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|volume=124|issue=3|pages=194–98|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.08.020|pmid=21396499|last1=Peterson|first1=M. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be able to avoid some types of [[physical disability]]. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to prevent [[osteoporosis]] and to improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="pmid21360219"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bergmann|last3=Boonen|last4=Boutsen|last5=Bruyere|last6=Devogelaer|last7=Goemaere|last8=Hollevoet|last9=Kaufman|year=2011|title=Non-pharmacological management of osteoporosis: a consensus of the Belgian Bone Club|journal=Osteoporos Int|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2769–88|doi=10.1007/s00198-011-1545-x|pmc=3186889|pmid=21360219|author=Body JJ, Bergmann P, Boonen S, Boutsen Y, Bruyere O, Devogelaer JP, Goemaere S, Hollevoet N, Kaufman JM, Milisen K, Rozenberg S, Reginster JY|last10=Milisen|last11=Rozenberg|last12=Reginster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of weight training for older people have been confirmed by studies of people who began engaging in it even in their 80s and 90s.

Though strength training can stimulate the [[cardiovascular system]], many exercise [[physiologist]]s, based on their observation of maximal [[oxygen]] uptake, argue that [[aerobics]] training is a better cardiovascular stimulus. Central [[catheter]] monitoring during resistance training reveals increased [[cardiac output]], suggesting that strength training shows potential for [[cardiovascular exercise]]. However, a 2007 meta-analysis found that, though aerobic training is an effective therapy for heart failure patients, combined aerobic and strength training is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Liang|last3=Pechter|last4=Jones|last5=McAlister|last6=Clark|date=2007-06-19|title=A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on left ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients: the benefit depends on the type of training performed|journal=J Am Coll Cardiol|volume=49|issue=24|pages=2329–36|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.055|pmid=17572248|author=Haykowsky MJ, Liang Y, Pechter D, Jones LW, McAlister FA, Clark AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training may be important to metabolic and cardiovascular health. Recent evidence suggests that resistance training may reduce metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. Overweight individuals with high strength fitness exhibit metabolic/cardiovascular risk profiles similar to normal-weight, fit individuals rather than overweight unfit individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lee|first2=M. M.|last3=Katiraie|first3=M|last4=Krell|first4=S. L.|last5=Angadi|first5=S. S.|last6=Chronley|first6=M. K.|last7=Oh|first7=C. S.|last8=Ribas|first8=V|last9=Harris|first9=R.

K.|last10=Hevener|first10=A. L.|last11=Croymans|first11=D. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For rehabilitation or to address an impairment ===
For many people in [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] or with an acquired [[disability]], such as following stroke or orthopaedic surgery, strength training for weak muscles is a key factor to optimise recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Dorsch|first2=S.|last3=Canning|first3=C. G.|year=2006|title=Strengthening interventions increase strength and improve activity after stroke: A systematic review|journal=Australian Journal of Physiotherapy|volume=52|issue=4|pages=241–48|doi=10.1016/S0004-9514(06)70003-4|pmid=17132118|last1=Ada|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people with such a health condition, their strength training is likely to need to be designed by an appropriate health professional, such as a [[physiotherapist]] or an [[occupational therapist]].

=== Increased sports performance ===
Stronger muscles improve performance in a variety of sports. Sport-specific training routines are used by many competitors. These often specify that the speed of [[muscle contraction]] during weight training should be the same as that of the particular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Phillips N | year = 1997 | title = Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning | url = | journal = Physiotherapy | volume = 83 | issue = 1| page = 47 | doi = 10.1016/s0031-9406(05)66120-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For the pleasure of the activity ===
One side effect of intense exercise is increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]], which can help to improve mood and counter feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (It should be noted that dopamine and serotonin were not found to be increased by resistance training).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 2001|title=Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=21|issue=1|pages=33–61|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(99)00032-X|pmid=11148895|last1=Salmon|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exercise and Depression|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comprehensive Physiology|year=2013|isbn=9780470650714|volume=3|pages=1337–62|chapter=Muscle as a Secretory Organ|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|pmid=23897689|issue=3|author1=Pedersen|first1=B. K.|journal=Comprehensive Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
The basic principles of strength training involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercises and force to cause desired changes in strength, endurance or size  by overloading of a group of muscles. The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the exercise: to gain size and strength multiple (4+) sets with fewer reps must be performed using more force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kargarfard|first2=M.|last3=Danaee|first3=M.|last4=Bahri Mohd Tamrin|first4=S.|year=2015|title=Intensive Resistance Exercise and Circadian Salivary Testosterone Concentrations Among Young Male Recreational Lifters|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=29|issue=1|pages=151–58|doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000000632|pmid=25051005|last1=Shariat|first1=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A wide spectrum of regimens can be adopted to achieve different results, but the classic formula recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine reads as follows:
* 8 to 12 repetitions of a resistance training exercise for each major muscle group at an intensity of 40% to 80% of a one-repetition max (RM) depending on the training level of the participant.
* Two to three minutes of rest is recommended between exercise sets to allow for proper recovery.
* Two to four sets are recommended for each muscle group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2013|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|journal=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|volume=17|issue=3|pages=8–13|doi=10.1249/fit.0b013e31828cb1e8|author=Klika, Brett|author2=Jordan, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically failure to use good form during a training set can result in injury or an inability to meet training goals – since the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of [[#Progressive overload|overload]] is never reached and the muscle does not gain in strength. There are cases when cheating is beneficial, as is the case where weaker groups become the weak link in the chain and the target muscles are never fully exercised as a result.

=== Terminology ===
Strength training has a variety of specialized terms used to describe parameters of strength training:
* [[Physical exercise|Exercise]] – different movements which involve rotating joints in specific patterns to challenge muscles in different ways.
* [[Form (exercise)|Form]] – each exercise has a specific form, a topography of movement designed to maximize safety and muscle strength gains.
* Rep – short for repetition, a rep is a single cycle of lifting and lowering a weight in a controlled manner, moving through the form of the exercise.
* [[Weight training|Set]] – a set consists of several repetitions performed one after another with no break between them with the number of reps per set and sets per exercise depending on the goal of the individual. The number of repetitions one can perform at a certain weight is called the Rep Maximum (RM). For example, if one could perform ten reps at 75&amp;nbsp;lbs, then their RM for that weight would be 10RM. [[1RM]] is therefore the maximum weight that someone can lift in a given exercise – i.e. a weight that they can only lift once without a break.
* [[Tempo]] – the speed with which an exercise is performed; the tempo of a movement has implications for the weight that can be moved and the effects on the muscle.

=== Realization of training goals ===
For developing endurance, gradual increases in volume and gradual decreases in intensity is the most effective program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1519/1533-4287(2003)017&lt;0082:ACOLAD&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = A Comparison of Linear and Daily Undulating Periodized Programs with Equated Volume and Intensity for Local Muscular Endurance| journal = The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research| volume = 17| pages = 82| year = 2003| last1 = Rhea | first1 = M.

Beginning weight-trainers are in the process of training the neurological aspects of strength, the ability of the brain to generate a rate of [[neuron]]al [[action potential]]s that will produce a muscular contraction that is close to the maximum of the muscle's potential.

Weights for each exercise should be chosen so that the desired number of repetitions can just be achieved.

=== Progressive overload ===
In one common method, weight training uses the principle of progressive overload, in which the [[muscle]]s are overloaded by attempting to lift at least as much weight as they are capable. They respond by growing larger and stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brooks | first = G.A. | author2 = Fahey, T.D. &amp; White, T.P. | year =1996 | title = Exercise Physiology:  Human Bioenergetics and Its Applications | publisher = Mayfield Publishing Co | isbn = 0-07-255642-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure is repeated with progressively heavier weights as the practitioner gains strength and endurance.

However, performing exercises at the absolute limit of one's strength (known as [[One rep maximum|one rep max]] lifts) is considered too risky for all but the most experienced practitioners. Moreover, most individuals wish to develop a combination of strength, endurance and muscle size. One repetition sets are not well suited to these aims. Practitioners therefore lift lighter (sub-maximal) weights, with more repetitions, to fatigue the muscle and all fibres within that muscle as required by the progressive overload principle.

Commonly, each exercise is continued to the point of momentary muscular failure. Contrary to widespread belief, this is not the point at which the individual thinks they cannot complete any more repetitions, but rather the first repetition that fails due to inadequate muscular strength. [[Training to failure]] is a controversial topic with some advocating training to failure on all sets while others believe that this will lead to [[overtraining]], and suggest training to failure only on the last set of an exercise.&lt;ref name="Stoppani"&gt;Stoppani, Jim (October 2004). [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-980825861.html Fail – to be strong.] ''Joe Weider's Muscle &amp; Fitness''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners recommend finishing a set of repetitions just before reaching a personal maximum at a given time. Adrenaline and other hormones may promote additional intensity by stimulating the body to lift additional weight (as well as the neuro-muscular stimulations that happen when in "fight-or-flight" mode, as the body activates more muscle fibres), so getting "psyched up" before a workout can increase the maximum weight lifted.

Weight training can be a very effective form of strength training because exercises can be chosen, and weights precisely adjusted, to safely exhaust each individual muscle group after the specific numbers of sets and repetitions that have been found to be the most effective for the individual. Other strength training exercises lack the flexibility and precision that weights offer.

=== Split training ===
Split training involves working no more than three muscle groups or body parts per day, instead spreading the training of specific body parts throughout a training cycle of several days. It is commonly used by more advanced practitioners due to the logistics involved in training all muscle groups maximally. Training all the muscles in the body individually through their full range of motion in a single day is generally not considered possible due to caloric and time constraints. Split training involves fully exhausting individual muscle groups during a workout, then allowing several days for the muscle to fully recover. Muscles are worked roughly twice per week and allowed roughly 72 hours to recover. Recovery of certain muscle groups is usually achieved on days while training other groups, i.e. a 7-day week can consist of a practitioner training trapezius, side shoulders and upper shoulders to exhaustion on one day, the following day the arms to exhaustion, the day after that the rear, front shoulders and back, the day after that the chest. In this way all mentioned muscle groups are allowed the necessary recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kraemer, William J. |author2=Zatsiorsky, Vladimir M. |title=Science and Practice of Strength Training, Second Edition |publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers |location=Champaign, Ill |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWSn4iKgNo8C&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=strength+training+weekly |isbn=0-7360-5628-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page= 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intensity, volume, and frequency ===
Three important variables of strength training are intensity, volume, and frequency. Intensity refers to the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] required to achieve the activity and is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[mass]] of the weights being lifted. Volume refers to the number of muscles worked, exercises, sets, and reps during a single session.  Frequency refers to how many training sessions are performed per week.

These variables are important because they are all mutually conflicting, as the muscle only has so much strength and endurance, and takes time to recover due to [[microtrauma]]. Increasing one by any significant amount necessitates the decrease of the other two, e.g. increasing weight means a reduction of reps, and will require more recovery time and therefore fewer workouts per week. Trying to push too much intensity, volume and frequency will result in [[overtraining]], and eventually lead to injury and other health issues such as chronic soreness and general [[lethargy]], illness or even acute trauma such as [[avulsion fracture]]s. A high-medium-low formula can be used to avoid overtraining, with either intensity, volume, or frequency being high, one of the others being medium, and the other being low. One example of this training strategy can be found in the following chart:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type!!High!!Med!!Low
|-
| Intensity (% of [[One rep maximum|1RM]])||80–100%||40–70%||0–40%
|-
| Volume (per muscle)||1 exercise||2 exercises||3+ exercises
|-
| Sets||1 set||2–3 sets||4+ sets
|-
| Reps||1–6 reps||8–15 reps||20+ reps
|-
| Session frequency||1 p/w||2–3 p/w||4+ p/w
|}

A common training strategy is to set the volume and frequency the same each week (e.g. training 3 times per week, with 2 sets of 12 reps each workout), and steadily increase the intensity (weight) on a weekly basis. However, to maximize progress to specific goals, individual programs may require different manipulations, such as decreasing the weight, and increase volume or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Luecke|first2=T.|last3=Wendeln|first3=H.|last4=Toma|first4=K.|last5=Hagerman|first5=F.|last6=Murray|first6=T.|last7=Ragg|first7=K.|last8=Ratamess|first8=N.|last9=Kraemer|first9=W.|year=2002|title=Muscular adaptations in response to three different resistance-training regimens: Specificity of repetition maximum training zones|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=88|issue=1–2|pages=50–60|doi=10.1007/s00421-002-0681-6|pmid=12436270|last1=Campos|first1=G.|last10=Staron|first10=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making program alterations on a daily basis (daily undulating periodization) seems to be more efficient in eliciting strength gains than doing so every 4 weeks (linear periodization),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|title=A comparison of linear and daily undulating periodized programs with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=16|issue=2|pages=250–55|doi=10.1519/1533-4287(2002)016&lt;0250:ACOLAD&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=11991778|author=Rhea MR|author2=Ball SD|author3=Phillips WT|author4=Burkett LN}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for beginners there are no differences between different periodization models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=A comparison of periodization models during nine weeks with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1245–50|doi=10.1519/R-20446.1|pmid=18076234|author=Buford TW|author2=Rossi SJ|author3=Smith DB|author4=Warren AJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periodization ===
There are many complicated definitions for periodization, but the term simply means the division of the overall training program into periods which accomplish different goals.

Periodization is the modulating of volume, intensity, and frequency over time, to both stimulate gains and allow recovery.

In some programs for example; volume is decreased during a training cycle while intensity is increased. In this template, a lifter would begin a training cycle with a higher rep range than he will finish with.

For this example, the lifter has a 1 rep max of 225&amp;nbsp;lb:

{| class="wikitable"

|}

This is an example of periodization where the number of repetitions decreases while the weight increases.

== Practice of weight training ==

=== Methods and equipment ===
{{See also|Weight training#Types of exercises|l1=Weight training: Types of exercises}}
There are many methods of strength training. Examples include [[weight training]], [[circuit training]], [[isometric exercise]], [[gymnastics]], [[plyometrics]], [[Parkour]], [[yoga]], [[Pilates]], [[Super Slow]].

Strength training may be done with minimal or no equipment, for instance [[bodyweight exercise]]s. [[Exercise equipment|Equipment]] used for strength training includes [[barbells]] and [[dumbbells]], [[weight machine]]s and other [[exercise machine]]s, [[weighted clothing]], [[resistance band]]s, [[:Category:gymnastics apparatus|gymnastics apparatus]], [[Swiss ball]]s, [[wobble board (exercise)|wobble boards]], [[indian club]]s, [[pneumatic exercise equipment]], [[hydraulic exercise equipment]].

=== Aerobic exercise versus anaerobic exercise ===
Strength training exercise is primarily [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]].&lt;ref name="kraemer"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=Strength training basics: Designing workouts to meet patients' goals|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=8|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.08.457|pmid=20086485|author1=Kraemer|first1=W. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even while training at a lower intensity (training loads of ~20-RM), anaerobic glycolysis is still the major source of power, although [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] metabolism makes a small contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=What is exercise? A primer for practitioners|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=3|pages=31–49|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.03.247|doi-broken-date=2018-05-05|pmid=20086460|author1=Knuttgen|first1=H. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weight training is commonly perceived as anaerobic exercise, because one of the more common goals is to increase strength by lifting heavy weights. Other goals such as rehabilitation, weight loss, body shaping, and bodybuilding often use lower weights, adding aerobic character to the exercise.

Except in the extremes, a muscle will fire fibres of both the aerobic or anaerobic types on any given exercise, in varying ratio depending on the load on the intensity of the contraction.&lt;ref name=Kraemer /&gt; This is known as the energy system continuum. At higher loads, the muscle will recruit all muscle fibres possible, both anaerobic ("fast-twitch") and aerobic ("slow-twitch"), in order to generate the most force. However, at maximum load, the anaerobic processes contract so forcefully that the aerobic fibers are completely shut out, and all work is done by the anaerobic processes. Because the anaerobic muscle fibre uses its fuel faster than the blood and intracellular restorative cycles can resupply it, the maximum number of repetitions is limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/18/07/06.html "Muscle Metabolism: Aerobic vs. Anaerobic"]. chiroweb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aerobic regime, the blood and intracellular processes can maintain a supply of fuel and oxygen, and continual repetition of the motion will not cause the muscle to fail.

[[Circuit weight training]] is a form of exercise that uses a number of weight training exercise sets separated by short intervals. The cardiovascular effort to recover from each set serves a function similar to an aerobic exercise, but this is not the same as saying that a weight training set is itself an aerobic process.

=== Exercises for specific muscle groups ===
{{Main|Weight training exercises}}
[[File:RomanChairBackExtension.JPG|thumb|right|400px|A ''back extension''.]]
Weight trainers commonly divide the body's [[List of muscles in the human body|individual muscles]] into ten major muscle groups. These do not include the [[hip]], [[neck]] and [[forearm]] muscles, which are rarely trained in isolation. The most common exercises for these muscle groups are listed below.

The sequence shown below is one possible way to order the exercises. The large muscles of the lower body are normally trained before the smaller muscles of the [[Upper body strength|upper body]], because these first exercises require more mental and physical energy. The core muscles of the [[torso]] are trained before the [[shoulder]] and [[arm]] muscles that assist them. Exercises often alternate between "pushing" and "pulling" movements to allow their specific supporting muscles time to recover. The stabilizing muscles in the [[waist]] should be trained last.

=== Advanced techniques ===
A number of techniques have been developed to make weight training exercises more intense, and thereby potentially increase the rate of progress. Many weight lifters use these techniques to bring themselves past a plateau, a duration where a weightlifter may be unable to do more lifting repetitions, sets, or use higher weight resistance.

==== Set structure ====

===== Drop sets =====
A drop set is an easy method of strength training where you perform a set of any exercise to failure or right before failure, and then reduce the weight and continue to lift for more repetitions with the decreased weight.

===== Pyramid sets =====
Pyramid sets are weight training sets in which the progression is from lighter weights with a greater number of repetitions in the first set, to heavier weights with fewer repetitions in subsequent sets.

A reverse pyramid is the opposite in which the heavier weights are used at the beginning and progressively lightened.

===== Burnouts =====
Burnouts combine pyramids and drop sets, working up to higher weights with low reps and then back down to lower weights and high reps.There are a few different ways one could perform burnout sets but the main idea is to perform an exercise until failure. You should start with a weight that is 75% of the amount of the maximum amount of weight you can lift for 1 rep. Once you’ve performed the exercise to exhaustion, reduce the weight and perform another set until failure, which will usually consist of much fewer repetitions. Burnout sets sound very similar to supersets but there are differences in the results they produce. Supersets help increase muscle mass, but are more efficient for producing muscle definition and shape. Burnout sets help increase muscle growth because of the buildup of lactic acid in the muscle when it’s forced to the point of failure.

===== Diminishing set =====
The diminishing set method is where a weight is chosen that can be lifted for 20 reps in one set, and then 70 repetitions are performed in as few sets as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Ross, Don (1988). ''Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-8069-6758-7}}. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rest-pause =====
The rest-pause training method takes one whole set and breaks it down into a few mini sets. There are two different goals that are associated with rest-pause training, you could use it to increase hypertrophy or increase strength. To increase hypertrophy you would perform a set with weight you are comfortable lifting for 6-10 reps and then set the weight down. Next, take 15 seconds worth of deep breaths and pick the weight back up and lift to failure. Lastly, repeat step two as many times as you want but it is commonly done twice. In order to increase strength using rest-pause method first you would choose a weight that is 85-95% of your one rep max. Then you would perform 1 rep with this weight and follow that up with a 30-45 second break. Then you could repeat this process as many times as you’d like.

===== Giant set =====
The Giant set, is a form of training that targets one muscle group (e.g. the triceps) with four separate exercises performed in quick succession, often to failure and sometimes with the reduction of weight halfway through a set once muscle fatigue sets in. This form of intense training 'shocks' the muscles and as such, is usually performed by experienced trainers and should be used infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2000|title=Heat Shock Protein Expression is Increased in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscles of Fischer 344 Rats After Endurance Training|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x/full|journal=Experimental Physiology|volume=85|issue=1|pages=97–102|doi=10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x|last1=Samelman|first1=T. R.|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Superset}}Combined sets ====
;Supersets: Supersets combine two or more exercises with similar motions to maximize the amount of work of an individual muscle or group of muscles.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The exercises are performed with no rest period between the exercises. An example would be doing bench press, which predominantly works the pectoralis and triceps muscles, and then moving to an exercise that works just the triceps such as the triceps extension or the pushdown.

;Push-pull supersets: Push-pull supersets are similar to regular supersets, but exercises are chosen which work opposing muscle groups. This is especially popular when applied to arm exercises, for example by combining biceps curls with the triceps pushdown. Other examples include the shoulder press and lat pulldown combination, and the bench press and wide grip row combination.

;Pre-exhaustion: Pre-exhaustion combines an isolation exercise with a compound exercise for the same muscle group. The isolation exercise first exhausts the muscle group, and then the compound exercise uses the muscle group's supporting muscles to push it further than would otherwise be possible. For example, the triceps muscles normally help the pectorals perform their function. But in the "bench press" the weaker triceps often fails first, which limits the impact on the pectorals. By preceding the bench press with the pec fly, the pectorals can be pre-exhausted so that both muscles fail at the same time, and both benefit equally from the exercise.

;Breakdowns: Breakdowns were developed by [[Frederick Hatfield]] and [[Mike Quinn (bodybuilder)|Mike Quinn]] to work the different types of [[muscle fiber]]s for maximum stimulation. Three different exercises that work the same muscle group are selected, and used for a superset. The first exercise uses a heavy weight (~85% of [[1 rep max]]) for around five reps, the second a medium weight (~70% of 1 rep max) for around twelve reps, and finally the third exercise is performed with a light weight (~50% of 1 rep max) for twenty to thirty reps, or even lighter (~40% of 1 rep max) for forty or more reps. ([[Training to failure|Going to failure]] is discouraged.) The entire superset is performed three times.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Ross, Don (1988). ''Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-8069-6758-7}}. pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Beyond failure ====
;Forced reps: Forced reps occur after momentary muscular failure. An assistant provides just enough help to get the weight trainer past the [[sticking point]] of the exercise, and allow further repetitions to be completed. Weight trainers often do this when they are [[spotting (weight training)|spotting]] their exercise partner. With some exercises forced reps can be done without a training partner. For example, with one-arm ''biceps curls'' the other arm can be used to assist the arm that is being trained.

;Cheat reps: [[Cheating#Strength training|Cheating]] is a deliberate compromise of [[Form (exercise)|form]] to maximize reps. Cheating has the advantage that it can be done without a training partner, but compromises [[Strength training#Safety|safety]]. A typical example of cheat reps occurs during biceps curls when, beginning with the load at the waist, the exerciser swings the barbell or dumbbell forward and up during the concentric phase utilizing momentum to assist their bicep muscles in moving the load to a shortened muscle position. Momentum assistance during the concentric phase allows them to move greater loads during the more difficult concentric phase. The objective can be to position greater loads of resistance to the biceps in preparation of performing the eccentric phase than the more difficult concentric phase would otherwise allow. Replacing a typical function of a training partner with a solo exerciser performing cheat reps facilitates forced reps or [[negative repetition|negative reps]] when training alone.

;Weight stripping a.k.a. Number Setting: Weight stripping is a technique used after failure with a normal resistance in certain exercises, particularly with easily adjustable machines, whereby the weight trainer or a partner gradually reduces the resistance after a full set is taken to failure. With each reduction in resistance, as many possible reps are completed and the resistance is then reduced again. This is continued until the resistance is approximately half the original resistance.

;Negative reps: [[Negative repetition|Negative reps]] are performed with much heavier weights. Assistants lift the weight, and then the weight trainer attempts to resist its downward progress through an eccentric contraction. Alternatively, an individual can use an exercise machine for negatives by lifting the weight with both arms or legs, and then lowering it with only one. Or they can simply lower weights more slowly than they lift them: for example, by taking two seconds to lift each weight and four seconds to lower it.

;Partial reps: Partial reps, as the name implies, involves movement through only part of the normal path of an exercise. Partial reps can be performed with heavier weights. Usually, only the easiest part of the repetition is attempted.

;Burns: Burns involve mixing partial reps into a set of full range reps in order to increase intensity. The partials can be performed at any part of the exercise movement, depending on what works best for the particular exercise. Also, the partials can either be added after the end of a set or in some alternating fashion with the full range reps.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Weis, Dennis (1986) ''Mass!, New Scientific Bodybuilding Secrets''. Contemporary Books. {{ISBN|0-8092-4940-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, after performing a set of ''biceps curls'' to failure, an individual would cheat the bar back to the most contracted position, and then perform several partial reps.

==== Other techniques ====
;Progressive movement training: Progressive movement training attempts to gradually increase the [[range of motion]] throughout a training cycle. The lifter will start with a much heavier weight than they could handle in the full range of motion, only moving through the last 3–5" of the movement.  Throughout the training cycle, the lifter will gradually increase the range of motion until the joint moves through the full range of the exercise.  This is a style that was made popular by Paul Anderson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

;Time under tension: Time under tension or TUT repetitions are performed with lighter weights. Time under tension refers to the amount of time your muscle under stress during a set. This consists of the time spent in the concentric or the shortening phase, peak contraction phase, as well as the eccentric or the lengthening phase. For example, if you go perform a set of 10 reps and each rep takes 3 seconds to complete, your muscle is under tension for a total of 30 seconds. If you were to perform the same exercise but if you spent 2 seconds in the concentric phase, 1 second to stop during peak contraction, and 3 seconds to lower the weight during the eccentric phase of the rep, the same 10 reps would end up putting your muscles under tension for about 60 seconds.

[[File:WristStrap.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Using a wrist strap.]]

;Wrist straps: Wrist straps (lifting straps) are sometimes used to assist in gripping very heavy weights. Wrist straps can be used to isolate muscle groups like in "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the ''deadlift''. Some lifters avoid using wrist straps to develop their [[grip strength]], just as some go further by using thick bars. Wrist straps can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than they might be able to handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.

== Combined techniques ==
Strength training may involve the combining of different training methods such as weight training, plyometrics, bodyweight exercises, and ballistic exercises. This is often done in order to improve a person's ability to apply their strength quickly. Or in other words, to improve their ability to apply explosive power.

=== Loaded plyometrics ===
Loaded plyometrics involve the addition of weights to jumping exercises. The weights may be held or worn. For instance, vertical jumps whilst holding a trap bar or jumping split squats whilst holding dumbbells. This helps to enhance the explosive power of the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek, Kennelly, Steve, 'Equipment' in ''Plyometric Anatomy'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex training ===
Complex training, also known as contrast training, involves the alternation of weight training and plyometric exercises. Ideally, both sets of exercises should move through similar ranges of movement; such a pairing is called a complex, or contrast, pair. For instance, a set of heavy back squats at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a set of jumping exercises. The intention is to utilise the intense nervous system activation and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift in the plyometric exercise; thereby increasing the power with which it can be performed. Over a period of training, this may result in the athlete being able to perform the plyometric exercise more powerfully, without the requirement of the preceding heavy lift.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., ‘Complex Training, or Contrast Loading’ in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics: Leeds, 2013, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the same principles, a sports specific action may be incorporated instead of the plyometric exercise; the intention, in this case, being to increase the athlete's ability to perform the sports specific action more powerfully.

=== Ballistic training ===
Ballistic training, sometimes referred to as power training, is based upon the principle of maximising the acceleration phase of the exercise and minimising the deceleration phase; this helps to improve the athlete's explosive power. On this basis, ballistic training may include exercises which involve the throwing of a weight, such as a medicine ball, or jumping whilst holding or wearing a weight.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., 'Ballistic Training' in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics:Leeds, 2013, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contrast loading ===
Contrast loading is the alternation of heavy and light loads i.e. a heavy bench press set at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a light bench press set at about 30-60% 1RM. The heavy set should be performed fast with the light set being performed as fast as possible. The joints should not be locked as this inhibits muscle fibre recruitment and reduces the speed at which the exercise can be performed. A loaded plyometric exercise, or ballistic exercise, may take the place of the light lift.

Similarly to complex training, contrast loading relies on the intense nervous system activation and enhanced muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift to help improve the power with which the subsequent exercise can be performed.&lt;ref&gt;McGuigan, Mike, ‘Contrast Training’ in ''Developing Power'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; This physiological effect is commonly referred to as post-activation potentiation, or the PAP effect. By way of explanation, if a light weight is lifted, and then a heavy weight is lifted, and then the same light weight is lifted again, then the light weight will feel lighter the second time it is lifted. This is due to the increased PAP effect from the heavy lift allowing for greater power to be applied and thus making the subsequent lighter lift feel even lighter than before. Explosive power training programmes are frequently designed to specifically utilise the PAP effect.

== Risks and concerns ==
{{Howto|section|date=July 2009}}
Strength training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are controlled, and carefully defined. Or some safety measures can also be taken before the training. However, as with any form of exercise, improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury. A helmet, boots, gloves, and back belt can aide in injury prevention. Principles of [[Weight training#Safety|weight training safety]] apply to strength training.

=== Bodybuilding ===
{{Main|Bodybuilding}}
[[Bodybuilding]] is a sport in which the goal is to increase muscle size and definition. Bodybuilding increases the endurance of muscles, as well as strength, though not as much as if it were the primary goal. Bodybuilders compete in bodybuilding competitions, and use specific principles and methods of strength training to maximize muscular size and develop extremely low levels of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. In contrast, most strength trainers train to improve their strength and endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat below normal. Strength trainers tend to focus on compound exercises to build basic strength, whereas bodybuilders often use isolation exercises to visually separate their muscles, and to improve muscular [[symmetry]]. Pre-contest training for bodybuilders is different again, in that they attempt to retain as much muscular tissue as possible while undergoing severe [[dieting]]. However, the bodybuilding community has been the source of many strength training principles, techniques, vocabulary, and customs.

=== Nutrition ===
It is widely accepted that strength training must be matched by changes in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] in order to be effective. Although aerobic exercise has been proven to have an effect on the dietary intake of macronutrients, strength training has not &lt;ref name="IS2008"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Self-reported dietary intake following endurance, resistance and concurrent endurance and resistance training|journal=Journal of Sports Science &amp; Medicine|volume=7|issue=2|pages=255–59|pmc=3761454|pmid=24149458|author=Shaw, B.S.|author2=Shaw, I.|author3=Brown, G.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an increase in dietary [[protein]] is generally believed to be required for building skeletal muscle.

A review of 49 research studies found that supplementation of protein in the diet of healthy adults increased the size and strength of muscles during prolonged resistance exercise training; protein intakes of greater than 1.6 g/kg/day did not additionally increase fat-free mass or muscle size or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton RW, Murphy KT, McKellar SR, Schoenfeld BJ, Henselmans M, Helms E, Aragon AA, Devries MC, Banfield L, Krieger JW, Phillips SM |title=A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=376–384 |date=March 2018 |pmid=28698222 |pmc=5867436 |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2017-097608 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein that is neither needed for cell growth and repair nor consumed for energy is converted into urea mainly through the deamination process and is excreted by the kidneys. It was once thought that a high-protein diet entails risk of [[kidney]] damage, but studies have shown that kidney problems only occur in people with previous [[kidney disease]]. However failure to properly hydrate can put an increased strain on the kidney's ability to function.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Lisa. [http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art14944.asp "Low Carb, Atkins and Kidneys"]. bellaonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=High-protein diets are not hazardous for the healthy kidneys|journal=Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation|volume=20|issue=3|pages=657–58; author reply 658|doi=10.1093/ndt/gfh645|pmid=15735253|author=Manninen AH.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adequate supply of [[Carbohydrate#Nutrition|carbohydrates]] (5–7&amp;nbsp;g per kg) is also needed as a source of energy and for the body to restore [[glycogen]] levels in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2004|title=Regulation of muscle glycogen repletion, muscle protein synthesis and repair following exercise|journal=Journal of sports science &amp; medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=131–38|pmc=3905295|pmid=24482590|author1=Ivy|first1=J. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A light, balanced meal prior to the workout (usually one to two hours beforehand) ensures that adequate energy and amino acids are available for the intense bout of exercise. The type of nutrients consumed affects the response of the body, and [[nutrient timing]] whereby protein and carbohydrates are consumed prior to and after workout has a beneficial impact on muscle growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2004|title=Influence of nutrition on responses to resistance training|url=http://www.purdue.edu/swo/nutrition/KnowItAll/HealthyWeightGain/InfluenceOfNutritionOnWtGain.pdf|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=36|issue=4|pages=689–96|doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000121944.19275.c4|pmid=15064597|author1=Volek|first1=J. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is consumed throughout the course of the workout to prevent poor performance due to [[dehydration]]. A protein shake is often consumed immediately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hayes|year=2006|title=Effects of supplement timing and resistance exercise on skeletal muscle hypertrophy|url=http://eprints.vu.edu.au/1436/1/MSSE2006_(3).pdf|journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1918–25|doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000233790.08788.3e|pmid=17095924|author=Cribb PJ, Hayes A}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the workout, because both protein uptake and protein usage are increased at this time.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Glucose (or another simple sugar) is often consumed as well since this quickly replenishes any [[glycogen]] lost during the exercise period.
To maximise muscle protein anabolism, recovery drink should contain glucose (dextrose), protein (usually [[whey]]) hydrolysate containing mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, and [[leucine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Hyperinsulinaemia, hyperaminoacidaemia and post-exercise muscle anabolism: the search for the optimal recovery drink|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=40|issue=11|pages=900–05|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.030031|pmc=2465040|pmid=16950882|author=Manninen AH.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some weight trainers also take [[ergogenic aid]]s such as [[creatine]] or [[steroid]]s to aid muscle growth. However, the effectiveness of some products is disputed and others are potentially harmful.

=== Sex differences in mass gains ===

Due to the androgenic hormonal differences between males and females, the latter are generally unable to develop large muscles regardless of the training program used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1 |title=Strength Training for Women |publisher=IDEA Personal Trainer |last=Freedson |first=PS |accessdate=2008-02-06 |date=2000-07-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716223517/http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1 |archivedate=July 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the most that can be achieved is a look similar to that of a [[fitness and figure competition|fitness model]]. Muscle is [[density|denser]] than fat, so someone who builds muscle while keeping the same body weight will occupy less volume; if two people weigh the same (and are the same height) but have different lean body mass percentages, the one with more muscle will appear thinner.&lt;ref name="Ebben"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1998|title=Strength training for women: Debunking myths that block opportunity|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=26|issue=5|pages=86–97|doi=10.3810/psm.1998.05.1020|pmid=20086816|author=Ebben, W.P.|author2=Jensen, R.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, though bodybuilding uses the same principles as strength training, it is with a goal of gaining muscle bulk.  Strength trainers with different goals and programs will not gain the same mass as a professional bodybuilder.

=== Muscle toning ===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}
Some weight trainers perform light, high-repetition exercises in an attempt to "tone" their muscles without increasing their size.

The word tone derives from the Latin "tonus" (meaning "tension"). In anatomy and physiology, as well as medicine, the term "muscle tone" refers to the continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles, or the muscles' resistance to passive stretching during resting state as determined by a deep tendon reflex. [[Muscle tone|Muscle tonus]] is dependent on neurological input into the muscle. In medicine, observations of changes in muscle tonus can be used to determine normal or abnormal states which can be indicative of pathology. The common strength training term "tone" is derived from this use.

What muscle builders refer to as a ''toned physique'' or "muscle firmness" is one that combines reasonable muscular size with moderate levels of body fat, qualities that may result from a combination of diet and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lies, Damned Lies, and Muscle Tone | publisher = CrossFit Impulse|url=http://crossfitimpulse.com/lies-damned-lies-and-muscle-tone/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle tone or firmness is derived from the increase in [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments in the [[sarcomere]]. When this occurs the same amount of neurological input creates a greater firmness or tone in the resting continuous and passive partial contraction in the muscle.

Exercises of 6–12 reps cause hypertrophy of the [[sarcoplasm]] in [[Skeletal muscle#Skeletal muscle fiber types|slow-twitch and high-twitch muscle fibers]], contributing to overall increased muscle bulk. This is not to be confused with [[myofibril]] hypertrophy which leads to strength gains. Both however can occur to an extent during this rep range. ''Even though most are of the opinion that higher repetitions are best for producing the desired effect of muscle firmness or tone, it is not.'' Low volume strength training of 5 repetitions or fewer will increase strength by increasing [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments thereby increasing muscle firmness or tone. The low volume of this training will inhibit the hypertrophy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1995|title=Capillary growth in chick skeletal muscle with normal maturation and hypertrophy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034568795000607|journal=Respiration Physiology|volume=102|issue=2–3|pages=293–301|doi=10.1016/0034-5687(95)00060-7|pmid=8904020|last1=Snyder|first1=Gregory K.|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowered-calorie diets have no positive effect on [[muscle hypertrophy]] for muscle of any  fiber type. They may, however, decrease the thickness of [[subcutaneous fat]] (fat between muscle and skin), through an overall reduction in body fat, thus making muscle striations more visible.

=== Weight loss ===
Exercises like sit-ups, or abdominal crunches, performs less work than whole-body aerobic exercises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/1997/06jun/sit_up.htm | last = Stamford | first = B | year = 1997 | title = The right way to do sit-ups | journal = The Physician and Sportsmedicine | volume = 25 | issue = 6|doi=10.3810/psm.1997.06.1433| doi-broken-date = 2018-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby expending fewer calories during exercise than jogging, for example.

Hypertrophy serves to maintain muscle mass, for an elevated [[basal metabolic rate]], which has the potential to burn more calories in a given period compared to aerobics. This helps to maintain a higher metabolic rate which would otherwise diminish after metabolic adaption to dieting, or upon completion of an aerobic routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R.E.|year=2003|title=Physical activity and weight management: Building the case for exercise|journal=The Physical and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=9|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.11.557|pmid=20086447|author2=Jakicic, J.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight loss also depends on the type of strength training used. Weight training is generally used for bulking, but the bulking method will more than likely not increase weight because of the diet involved. However, when resistance or circuit training is used, because they are not geared towards bulking, women tend to lose weight more quickly. Lean muscles require calories to maintain themselves at rest, which will help reduce fat through an increase in the [[basal metabolic rate]].

== History ==
[[File:EarlyBarbell.png|right|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Saxon]] performing a [[Two Hands Anyhow]] with an early [[kettlebell]] and plate-loaded [[barbell]].]]
Until the 20th century, the history of strength training was very similar to the history of weight training. With the advent of modern technology, materials and knowledge, the methods that can be used for strength training have multiplied significantly.

[[Hippocrates]] explained the principle behind strength training when he wrote "that which is used develops, and that which is not used wastes away", referring to muscular [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and [[Atrophy#Muscle atrophies|atrophy]]. Progressive resistance training dates back at least to [[Ancient Greece]], when legend has it that wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] trained by carrying a newborn [[calf]] on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician [[Galen]], described strength training exercises using the [[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (an early form of [[dumbbell]]) in the 2nd century.  Ancient [[Persia]]ns used the [[Indian club|''meels'']], which became popular during the 19th century as the Indian club, and has recently made a comeback in the form of the clubbell.

The dumbbell was joined by the [[barbell]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Early barbells had hollow globes that could be filled with [[sand]] or [[lead shot]], but by the end of the century these were replaced by the plate-loading barbell commonly used today.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal |last=Todd |first=Jan |year=1995 |format=PDF |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/IGH/IGH0306/IGH0306c.pdf |title=From Milo to Milo: A History of Barbells, Dumbells&lt;!--sic--&gt;, and Indian Clubs |journal=Iron Game History |volume=3 |issue=6 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training with [[isometric exercise]] was popularised by [[Charles Atlas]] from the 1930s onwards. The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of [[exercise machine]]s into the still-rare strength training gyms of the time. Strength training became increasingly popular in the 1980s following the release of the bodybuilding movie ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' and the subsequent popularity of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name=U.S.C.D.P.&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13956966/ "Sculpted trend spurs women to pump iron"].

=== Safety concerns related to children ===
[[File:Kids power training.jpeg|thumb|Properly supervised strength training for children.]]
[[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopaedic]] specialists used to recommend that children avoid weight training because the [[growth plate]]s on their [[bone]]s might be at risk. The very rare reports of growth plate fractures in children who trained with weights occurred as a result of inadequate supervision, improper form or excess weight, and there have been no reports of injuries to growth plates in youth training programs that followed established guidelines.&lt;ref name = KH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/nutrition_fit/fitness/strength_training.html | title = Strength Training and Your Child | publisher = kidshealth.org | last = Dowshen | first = S |author2=Homeier B  | accessdate = 2008-01-18 | date = 2005-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NSCA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association |last=Faigenbaum |first=AD |title=Youth Resistance Training |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045321/http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the National Strength and Conditioning Association is that strength training is safe for children if properly designed and supervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf |format=pdf |title=Position statement:  Youth Resistance Training |publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045336/http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger children are at greater risk of injury than adults if they drop a weight on themselves or perform an exercise incorrectly; further, they may lack understanding of, or ignore the safety precautions around weight training equipment.  As a result, supervision of minors is considered vital to ensuring the safety of any youth engaging in strength training.&lt;ref name = KH /&gt;&lt;ref name = NSCA /&gt;

==== Australia's stance on pre-adolescence strength training  ====
Strength training is the fourth most popular form of fitness in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, S. (2015). [http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/top-fitness-trends-for-2015-20150106-12j220.html Top fitness trends for 2015]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its popularity amongst all ages, there is great scepticism on what the appropriate age to commence strength training in young athletes is. Some points of the opposing view of strength training in young adolescence are stunted growth, health and bone problems in later stages of life and unhealthy eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Stenson, J. (2003). [http://www.nbcnews.com/Default.aspx?id=3076614&amp;p1=0#.VzrQuJF97ic Should kids pump iron?]. msnbc.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Australian experts that have been recognised by the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) have debunked these myths. There is no link between any prolonged health risks and strength training in pre-adolescence if the procedures of strength training are followed correctly and under suitable supervision. Strength training for pre-adolescents should focus on skills and techniques. Children should only work on strengthening all the big muscle groups, using free weight and body weight movements with relatively light loads. The benefits of these practices include increased strength performance, injury prevention and learning good training principles.&lt;ref&gt;Sibte, N.

=== For older adults ===
Older adults are prone to loss of muscle strength.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Progressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults|journal=International Journal of Older People Nursing|volume=6|issue=3|pages=244–46|doi=10.1111/j.1748-3743.2011.00291.x|pmid=21884490|author=Christie, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Chiung-Ju|last2=Latham|first2=Nancy K.|date=2009-07-08|title=Progressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD002759|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002759.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4324332|pmid=19588334}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more strength older adults have  better health, better [[quality of life]], better physical function&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and fewer [[Falling (accident)|falls]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In cases in which an older person begins strength training, their doctor or health care provider may neglect to emphasize a strength training program which results in muscle gains.

In setting up an exercise program for an older adult, they should go through a [[Baseline (medicine)|baseline]] fitness assessment to determine their current limits. Any exercise program for older adults should match the intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that the person can perform. The program should have a goal of increased strength as compared to the baseline measurement.&lt;ref name="APTAfive" /&gt;

Recommended training for older adults is three times a week of light strength training exercises. Exercise machines are a commonly used equipment in a gym setting, including treadmills with exercises such as walking or light jogging. Home-based exercises should usually consist of body weight or elastic band exercises that maintain a low level of impact on the muscles. Weights can also be used by older adults if they maintain a lighter weight load with an average amount of repetitions (10–12 reps) with suitable supervision. It is important for older adults to maintain a light level of strength training with low levels of impact to avoid injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Progressive resistance strength training can reduce physical disability in older adults|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=46|issue=5|pages=323–24|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2012-091018|pmid=22442190|author1=Keuerleber, J.|author2=Henschke, N.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older people who exercise against a resistance or force become stronger .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Progressive resistance training (PRT)  also improves physical functioning in older people, including the performance of  simple (e.g.: walking, climbing stairs, rising from a chair more quickly) and complex daily activities (e.g.: bathing, cooking).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Caution is recommended when transferring PRT exercises for clinical populations, as adverse effects are unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''The President's Challenge''' (also called '''Presidential Champions''') was an [[United States|American]] program promulgated by the  [[President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition]] that aimed to encourage all Americans to "make being active part of their everyday lives" and to be [[Physical fitness|physically fit]]. The President's Challenge was designed to help motivate participants (international participants also eligible) to improve regardless of activity and fitness level.  The Presidential Champions program was discontinued on June 30, 2018.&lt;ref name="CMP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.choosemyplate.gov/tools-supertracker  |title=SuperTracker Discontinuation |accessdate =June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==The program==
The President's Challenge program included Awards for actively performing members in their preferred games, sports, or athletics. There were various levels of Awards available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://presidentschallenge.org/celebrate/index.shtml |title=Celebrate your achievements |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128070329/http://presidentschallenge.org/celebrate/index.shtml |archive-date=2010-11-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

* Presidential Active Lifestyle Award (PALA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://presidentschallenge.org/celebrate/active-lifestyle.shtml |title=Presidential Active Lifestyle Award |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128070740/http://presidentschallenge.org/celebrate/active-lifestyle.shtml |archive-date=2010-11-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Health Fitness Award
* Presidential Champions Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://presidentschallenge.org/celebrate/presidential-champions/index.shtml |title=Presidential Champions Awards |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128070135/http://presidentschallenge.org/celebrate/presidential-champions/index.shtml |archive-date=2010-11-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Presidential Champions Bronze Award
** Presidential Champions Silver Award
** Presidential Champions Gold Award
** Presidential Champions Platinum Award

To obtain credit participants must log in their daily efforts, which as noted above can include both sports and physical fitness activities.  Each daily activity gives a certain number of points, the number computed by both its intensity and duration.  Reporting is entirely on the [[honor system]].  Each higher level award requires accumulating more points.  There is not a time limit.  Qualifiers are eligible for certificates, medals and patches, with the platinum award being a large medallion.  The lower levels are comparatively easy, while the platinum award requires a sustained effort, typically over several years.  Annually the number of people who reached this point has increased.  Over 100 a year now earn it.  Several have been awarded it multiple times.

Participants who achieve the Platinum Award are also offered participation in the Presidential Champions Platinum Award program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://presidentschallenge.org/celebrate/presidential-champions/platinum/index.shtml |title=Platinum Award Winners |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026092817/http://www.presidentschallenge.org/celebrate/presidential-champions/platinum/index.shtml |archive-date=2010-10-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Platinum Awards page was taken down in 2016 following the transition of the program from being under the administration of [[FDA]] to the Department on Agriculture on August 31, 2016. SuperTracker and the new management did not track Platinum earners or post any information about them, and the program was suspended in 2018.&lt;ref name="CMP"/&gt;

==Website hacked==
On January 11, 2012, the operators of the website for participants of the Challenge and Active Lifestyle programs learned that the website had been [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]] resulting in the release of personal information of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tau|first=Bryon|title=Let's Move-affiliated website hacked|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/01/lets-moveaffiliated-website-hacked-111532.html|work=Politico|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=January 19, 2012|date=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President's Challenge website said it was down for "Site Maintenance – We're taking a little breather."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Maintenance|url=https://www.presidentschallenge.org/maintenance/index.shtml|publisher=The President's Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition|accessdate=January 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113022659/http://www.presidentschallenge.org/maintenance/index.shtml|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2012, the website was modified to explain the hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We apologize for the site maintenance.

On January 27, 2012, The President's Challenge sent out emails to its participants saying that the website was functional as of January 24, 2012, and asked participants to reset their user passwords.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.presidentschallenge.org/account/security.php Important Security Information]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/preschal The President's Challenge Facebook page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Awards==
The awards program was terminated on June 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.choosemyplate.gov/tools-supertracker SuperTracker will be discontinued on June 30, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Superman (181095786).jpg|150px|thumb|BMX vert jump]]

'''Vert''' is a term used in [[extreme sports]] especially [[vert skating]], [[vert skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]] and [[BMX]] to denote a competition held on a [[vert ramp]] which allows the competitors to fly into the air and land back on the ramp. This time in the air allows the competitor to perform moves which would otherwise be extremely difficult. An example of this would be a flip, or a spin.

The term itself comes from the word "[[vertical direction|vertical]]," the direction in which the competitor is moving after leaving the ramp.

Ramps used in these events are usually [[vert ramp]]s.

Outside of competitions, the term ''vert'' is not normally used. Instead, the specific type of ramp is denoted. So instead of saying "I am going to go ride vert," one might say "I am going to go ride a [[half-pipe]]." However, it would be correct to say "in competitions, I usually ride vert," in order to differentiate from other forms of competition (such as freestyle, park or street).

ESPN's X Games initially eliminated vert from its 2008 competition, due to declining ratings over the last few years, but because of a proposed boycott of the "Big Air" event, mainly by the professional skateboarders, it was reinstated.

'''Violence in sports''' usually refers to violent and often unnecessarily harmful intentional physical acts committed during, or motivated by, a [[sports|sports game]], often in relation to contact sports such as [[American football]], [[ice hockey]], [[rugby football]], [[lacrosse]], [[association football]], [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], and [[water polo]] and, when referring to the players themselves, often involving excessively violent or potentially illegal physical contact beyond the normal levels of contact expected while playing the sport. These acts of violence can include intentional attempts to injure a player or coach by another player or coach, but can also include threats of physical harm or actual physical harm sustained by players or coaches by fans or those engaging in the spectating of sports, or threats and acts of violence performed by fans or spectators upon opposing fans or other spectators.

==Causes==
There are two major theories on the cause of violence in sports. One theory holds that humans have an instinct for violence, developed during a time when early human ancestors had to resort to violence and aggressiveness to survive and reproduce. Another theory deals with the sociological aspects of violence in sports, stating that sports are "mock battles" which can become actual battles due to their competitive nature.&lt;ref name="Salamone2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salamone |first1=Frank A. |title=Society, Culture, Leisure and Play |year=2000 |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=9780761816256 |pages=273–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence by athletes==
Through a "civilizing process", many modern sports have become less tolerant of bloodshed than past versions, although many violent aspects of these sports still remain.&lt;ref name="Salamone2000"/&gt;
 
Athletes sometimes resort to violence, in hopes of injuring and intimidating opponents. Such incidents may be part of a strategy developed by coaches or players.

In boxing, unruly or extremely violent behavior by one of the contestants often results in the fighter breaking the rules being penalized with a points reduction, or, in extreme cases, disqualification. Outlawed tactics in boxing include hitting the opponent on the back of the head, under the belly during clinching, and to the back. Other tactics that are outlawed, but less seen, are pushing an opponent extremely hard to the floor, kicking, or hitting repeatedly after the round has ended. Similar actions have also happened in [[ice hockey]] and [[Australian Football League]] matches.

===Ritual violence===
High school, college, and even professional sports teams often include [[initiation]] ceremonies (known as [[hazing]] in the USA) as a [[rite of passage]]. A 1999 study by [[Alfred University]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] found that approximately four out of five college US athletes (250,000 per year) experienced hazing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfred.edu/sports_hazing/.|title=Alfred University : News : NCAA Sports Survey|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half were required to take part in alcohol-related initiations, while two-thirds were subjected to humiliation rituals.

==Fan violence==

Violence may also be related to nationalism or as an outlet for underlying social tensions. It is often [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]-related.

Violence by supporters of sports teams dates back to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when supporters of chariot racing teams were frequently involved in major riots. Usually, underlying political and/or theological issues helped fuel riots related to sporting events in the Roman era. The [[Nika riots]] of 532 were especially deadly, with tens of thousands reportedly killed.

In periods when theatre was considered a form of mass entertainment, there were phenomena of rival fans supporting rival actors or theatrical teams, occasionally leading to violent outbursts having many similarities to present-day violence of sports fans – the [[Astor Place Riot]] in 1849 New York City being a conspicuous example.

The actions of English [[association football|football]] [[football hooliganism|hooligans]] and [[football firm|firms]] in the 1980s caused English teams to be banned from European competition for six years after the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985. Although the level of football-related violence was significantly reduced in England after this event, in the recent [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] tournament, [[England national football team|England]] were publicly warned that any violence by supporters at matches could result in their ejection from the tournament. Many known hooligans were prevented from traveling to the tournament in Portugal. There was a collective sigh of relief from security experts in the USA when England failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Alan Rothenberg]] (chairman of the World Cup organizing committee in the United States in 1994) said:

{{cquote|There were three countries in the world whose presence would have created logistical and security problems, so we're very pleased they won't be coming: Iraq, Iran and England.}}

===Notable examples of fan violence===

* In 532, the rivalry between supporters of the ''Blue'' and ''Green'' [[chariot racing#Byzantine chariot racing|chariot-racing]] teams in [[Constantinople]] led to 30,000 deaths in the [[Nika riots]].
* The first meeting in the [[Holy War (Utah vs. BYU)|American football rivalry]] between [[BYU Cougars football|Brigham Young University]] and the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] took place in April 1896, when BYU was known as Brigham Young Academy. The two schools disagree to this day as to whether this game was official, but it mattered greatly to the spectators—at the end of the game, the two sets of fans fought one another.
* In the second edition of the [[Tour de France]] in [[1904 Tour de France|1904]], as the riders climbed the [[Col de la République]] in the [[Loire (department)|Loire]] [[Departments of France|department]], supporters of regional favorite [[Antoine Faure]] physically attacked several of his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Woodland, Les (2007), ''The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', Yellow Jersey Press, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velo101.com/actualite/default.asp?Id=2981&amp;Section=Route |title=Tour 1904 : mort de son succès| work=Vélo 101, le site officiel du vélo |publisher=Velo101.com |date=October 30, 2001 |accessdate=July 20, 2012|language= French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repercussions of this incident continue to this day—the Tour did not return to Loire until [[1950 Tour de France|1950]], and although the Tour has returned to the République (the first pass of 1,000 metres ever climbed in the Tour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Yellow Jersey Companion to the Tour de France|last= Woodland|first= Les| publisher=Yellow Jersey Press| year=2003 | isbn=0-224-063189|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 11 times since then, its appearances in the [[1903 Tour de France|1903]] and 1904 Tours are no longer officially recognized as Tour climbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/11/10/col-de-la-republique-was-eerste-berg-in-tour-de-france.aspx|title=Col de la République was eerste berg in Tour de France|author=Van den Bogaart, Ronnie|language=Dutch|date=November 10, 2007|accessdate=July 23, 2012|publisher=Sportgeschiedenis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226001610/http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/11/10/col-de-la-republique-was-eerste-berg-in-tour-de-france.aspx|archive-date=February 26, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1972, [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]] pummeled [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]] 30–3 in their annual [[Civil War (college football game)|"Civil War"]] football rivalry game, held this season at Oregon State's [[Parker Stadium]]. After the game, jubilant Oregon fans rushed the field and tore down the south goal post. They then turned to do the same to the north goal post, but were met by Oregon State fans who had come on the field, resulting in a major brawl.&lt;ref name=TO112208&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/behindbeaversbeat/2008/11/civil_war_5_moments_that_fanne.html |title=Civil War: 5 moments that fanned the flames of the rivalry |first=Seth |last=Prince |work=The Oregonian |date=November 22, 2008 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[1975 Tour de France|1975]], cyclist [[Eddy Merckx]] was viciously punched by a spectator as he climbed the [[Puy-de-Dôme]] in the Tour de France. Merckx, who had won the Tour de France five times previously and at the time was in the leader's yellow jersey, finished the stage barely able to breathe, and went on to finish the tour in second place overall.
* The [[Scottish Cup 1979–80|1980 Scottish Cup Final]] between bitter [[Old Firm]] rivals [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] was marred by an on-pitch riot between rival fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daEMvQsWys8|title=Celtic 1 Rangers 0 1980 Scottish 'riot' Cup Final|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the banning of alcohol from Scottish football and rugby matches.
* After [[Marvin Hagler]] knocked out [[Alan Minter]] in three rounds to win boxing's world middleweight title at [[Wembley Arena]] in 1980, many of Minter's supporters began to throw beer cans, bottles and other objects into the ring. Both Hagler and Minter, along with their respective handlers, had to be escorted out by [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]].
* On August 12, 1984, during a game between the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[San Diego Padres]] that degenerated into a [[beanball]] war:&lt;ref name="Beanball war"&gt;{{cite book |title=Baseball Hall of Shame |last=Nash |first=Bruce |author2=Zullo, Allan  |year=1989 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-671-68766-3 |pages=63–64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtX4CreRGNEC&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43&amp;dq=braves+padres+beanball+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nrJVzVYn9V&amp;sig=aYSg6y7nXtxQmR6Ip82h12bv0GI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CDq2TKy4GsSBlAfMrpnvBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** At least five fans were dragged from the field at [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]] in handcuffs after participating in a bench-clearing brawl.
** One of the fans was charged with assault for throwing a full beer mug at the Padres' [[Kurt Bevacqua]], hitting him in the head, as he was returning to the dugout.
** The game ended with police riot squads on top of both dugouts in an obvious attempt to keep fans away from the players.
* At the end of [[1984 Major League Baseball season|the same season]], violence erupted outside of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in Detroit after the [[Detroit Tigers]] defeated the Padres in the [[World Series]]. A well known photo from the riot shows a Tigers fan holding a World Series pennant in front of an overturned burning Detroit Police car.
* [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] – 39 people died when a wall collapsed under pressure of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] supporters fleeing from 'football [[football hooliganism|hooligans]]' supporting [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] during the [[1985 European Cup Final]].
* [[Dinamo–Red Star riot]] – a 1990 football match between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] was abandoned after ten minutes with thousands of fans fighting each other and the police. One of the Zagreb players, [[Zvonimir Boban]], was seen to kick a policeman, and after an hour long riot, the stadium was set on fire. Dinamo fans saw the riot as the beginning of the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montague|first=James|title=Five games that changed the world|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/01/05/iraq.asia.six.games/index.html|work=CNN|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1993, a mentally ill tennis fan stabbed [[Monica Seles]] during a changeover at a tennis match in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1175121/I-ballooned-size-8-18-I-stabbed-fan-says-tennis-ace-Monica-Seles.html|title='I ballooned from size 8 to 18 after I was stabbed by a fan,' says tennis ace Monica Seles|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1994, [[Vancouver Canucks]] fans [[1994 Stanley Cup riot|rioted]] in the streets of [[Vancouver]] after their team lost in the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup finals]].
* During the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombian]] football (soccer) player [[Andrés Escobar]] accidentally scored an [[own goal]] in a match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], a match which Colombia lost 2–1.  On his return to [[Colombia]], Escobar was confronted outside a bar in [[Medellín]] by a gunman who shot the player six times, killing him.  The gunman reportedly shouted "''¡Gol!''" ("Goal!") for each bullet fired.
* Rioting Indian fans at the Eden Gardens stadium in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] forced the end of the semi-final match between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]]. Fans started rioting when the home team, seemingly on the way to victory, underwent a dramatic batting collapse. [[Match referee]] [[Clive Lloyd]] brought the teams off the ground for their safety, then attempted to restart the match. When the fans remained throwing projectiles and damaging stadium facilities, the match was called off and awarded to Sri Lanka (who went on to win the World Cup).
* In 1996 during a night [[Australian Football League]] match at [[Waverley Park]] in [[Melbourne]] between [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], a [[pitch invasion]] occurred when the lights went out during the third quarter. Initially, a serious car crash into power lines in the nearby area was reported to have caused the [[Power outage|blackout]], although it was later confirmed to be a major electrical fault. In the midst of the chaos, fans rioted and stormed the ground, some lighting bonfires in the centre square, and removing two of the behind posts. The incidents were filmed on [[Network Seven]], and the remaining quarter and a half was played three nights later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~brad/96/round10.htm Round 10 1996, Essendon vs. St Kilda], Bomber Internet&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1998, [[Denver Broncos]] fans rioted in the streets of [[Denver]] after their team won [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. Near-riots happened when the team won the Super Bowl again the following year and after the [[Colorado Avalanche]]'s [[Stanley Cup]] wins in 1996 and 2001.

* In May 2001 during an Australian Football League match between [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] at [[Visy Park|Optus Oval]], Geelong's Darren Milburn executed a very late and illegal [[Bump (football)|bump]] on Carlton's [[Steven Silvagni]], collecting Silvagni's head with his hip, knocking Silvagni unconscious and leaving him having to be carried from the field by trainers. Milburn then proceeded to clap towards the crowd after being substituted, further igniting the situation; Carlton fans threatened Milburn, attempted to enter the interchange box to assault him, and attempted to attack Milburn's police escort in the car park after the match.&lt;ref&gt;Atwell, Glen.

* In September 2004 in the [[AFL Cairns|Cairns Australian Football League]] Grand Final between the North Cairns Tigers and the Port Douglas Crocs at [[Cazaly's Stadium]], a wild and violent 15&amp;nbsp;minute bench-clearing brawl erupted after Tigers players charged at the Crocs pre-match huddle at the end of the national anthem, and escalated when fans and team officials became involved. One fan was arrested and another five were ejected, while three Crocs players and a Crocs runner were left unconscious and having to be carried from the arena on stretchers. After a lengthy AFL investigation, the instigator, North Cairns Tigers coach and former VFL/AFL player Jason Love, was suspended for eight years, and the 22 North Cairns players were suspended for a total of 400 matches (suspensions ranging from 10 matches to five years) on a string of charges in relation to starting the brawl; the Tigers were forced to forfeit their first match of 2005 as a result of these suspensions.

* In May 2006 during an [[Australian Football League]] match between [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], a North Melbourne fan had a provocative confrontation with coach [[Dean Laidley]], to which Laidley responded with a verbal barrage, inviting the fan to the club rooms to see how badly the players were feeling due to their consistently poor on-field performance. The incident was captured on Australian national television. The fan committed suicide by throwing himself in the path of an oncoming train the next morning.
* On June 6, 2010, the final game of the [[Greek Basket League]] finals between ancient rivals [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] (PAO), also respectively known as the "Reds" and "Greens" from their club colors, degenerated into what one commentator called a "night of shame" for [[Basketball in Greece|Greek basketball]].&lt;ref name="Night of shame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/panathinaikos-olympiacos-greece-basketball-championship-riot-7669/ |title=On "Night of Shame", Panathinaikos Takes 8th Consecutive Greek Title in Riot Conditions |work=BallinEurope.com |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629090042/http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/panathinaikos-olympiacos-greece-basketball-championship-riot-7669/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Panathinaikos entered the game, held at Olympiacos' home of [[Peace and Friendship Stadium]], with a 2–1 lead in the best-of-5 series. The homestanding Reds fans were reportedly incensed at what they considered to be biased officiating in the Greens' favor in Game 3. The violence began even before tipoff, with police forced to use tear gas on rioting Reds fans; the game started 40 minutes late.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=4290 |title=Olympiakos fans force Game 4 to be suspended |work=SportinGreece.com |date=June 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003054552/http://www.sportingreece.com/kb/article.asp?fIndex=4290 |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third quarter, with PAO leading 50–42, the game was halted for about an hour after Olympiacos fans threw various incendiaries at the PAO bench, with one smoke bomb exploding next to the bench.&lt;ref name="Night of shame"/&gt; By the time the teams resumed play, all but about 2,000 fans had left.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"/&gt; Then, with little over a minute left in the game and PAO ahead 76–69, many of the remaining Reds fans began throwing objects on the court, leading the officials to suspend play and forfeit the game to PAO, giving the Greens the title.&lt;ref name="Olympiacos Game 4"/&gt; The new champions had to be escorted off the floor by riot police.&lt;ref name="Night of shame"/&gt; The league organizer, [[Hellenic Basketball Clubs Association|HEBA]], fined Olympiacos €111,000 and required them to play their first nine home games of the [[2010–11 Greek Basket League|2010–11 season]] behind closed doors and without live TV coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/fiba-world-championship-greece-spain-olympiacos-panathinaikos-riot-3116/ |title=Brutal Week for Greek Basketball Capped With 80–72 Loss to Spain |work=BallinEurope.com |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629072426/http://www.ballineurope.com/countries/greece/fiba-world-championship-greece-spain-olympiacos-panathinaikos-riot-3116/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot]] immediately followed the loss of the Vancouver Canucks hockey team to the Boston Bruins in the deciding Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals in June of that year.
* Later in the same month, major violence broke out involving supporters of historic Argentine football club [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] during and after their promotion/relegation playoff with [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]]. The first leg on June 22 [[Estadio Gigante de Alberdi|in Córdoba]] was delayed for 20 minutes after River Plate hooligans tore through a fence and stormed the field to verbally and physically attack River players. The second leg, on June 26 at [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|El Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, had what was reported to be the largest security presence for any match in the country's history, with over 2,200 police called in. However, it was not enough to keep River hooligans, angered at what became the club's first relegation from the top flight in their history, from rushing the field. Violence quickly spread, with fires set in the stadium, pitched battles between hooligans and police, and looting in nearby areas. At least 35 police and 55 civilians were reported to have been injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6706438/river-plate-relegated-argentine-2nd-division-first-time-club-history |title=Chaos erupts after River Plate relegated |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=June 27, 2011 |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 21, 2011, a [[2011–12 KNVB Cup#Fourth round|fourth round]] match in the [[2011–12 KNVB Cup]] between [[Eredivisie]] clubs [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] at Ajax's home of [[Amsterdam Arena]] was marred by a violent fan incident. In the 36th minute, Ajax held a 1–0 lead when a fan ran on the pitch and launched a karate kick from behind at AZ goalkeeper [[Esteban Alvarado]]. The player responded by kicking the fan several times before security arrived. When Alvarado was [[Misconduct (association football)#Sending-off offences (red card)|sent off]] for retaliating against his attacker, AZ left the pitch, and the match was abandoned. The [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] rescinded the red card and ordered the match replayed in its entirety [[Behind closed doors (football)|behind closed doors]] on January 19, 2012. Ajax was also fined €10,000 for failing to prevent the fan—who was supposed to be serving a 3-year stadium ban—from entering the pitch, and given a suspended one-match spectator ban (not including the replay). Ajax accepted the penalties, and announced that it had given the fan a 30-year stadium ban and a lifetime ban from the club and its season ticket list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7395584/ajax-az-alkmaar-cup-match-replayed-full |title=Ajax vs. Alkmaar to start from scratch |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=December 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American football===
* In a [[National Football League]] game on November 1, 1970, the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] led the [[Oakland Raiders]] 17–14, and a long run for a first-down run by quarterback [[Len Dawson]] apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]], who dove into Dawson with his helmet as he lay on the ground, provoking Chiefs’ receiver [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, Taylor and Davidson were ejected, and the penalties that were called nullified the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play. Taylor's unwise retaliation against Davidson's foul play not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the AFC West with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619085937/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Chiefs–Raiders rivalry]].

Several Newcastle players and a Villa player separated the two before either was seriously hurt, but Bowyer's shirt was ripped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/4404473.stm |title=Dyer &amp; Bowyer in amazing punch-up |work=BBC Sport |date=April 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian rules football===
* In 1994 Swans recruit [[Dermott Brereton]] was suspended for 7 weeks for standing on [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] player [[Rayden Tallis]]' head during a practice match; he was suspended for another 7 matches later in the season for elbowing [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] captain Tony Free and breaking his jaw. When Brereton transferred to Collingwood at the end of 1994 the AFL decided that his 7-week suspension was no longer applicable as it was applied to the club (Sydney) and not to the player (Brereton). [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] forward [[Tony Lockett]] was suspended for 8 matches during the season for elbowing Sydney's Peter Caven and breaking his nose.&lt;ref name="Footy's Hall of Shame, 1996"&gt;Footy's Hall of Shame, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Perhaps the most violent match in AFL history took place on June 5, 2004 Round 11, at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] between Hawthorn and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]. The final score was Hawthorn 12.8 (80) to Essendon 24.10 (154). During halftime, Brereton, by now Hawthorn club director, allegedly told Hawks players to draw a "line in the sand" and take a physical stand against the Bombers.&lt;ref name="dermie-ref"&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Hinds|title=Heavier blows to come for Hawks, Bombers|date=June 7, 2004|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/06/1086460175315.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third quarter, a number of on-field incidents led to several fights around the ground, culminating in a five-minute bench-clearing brawl.

* The first contest in what would become [[Utah–BYU rivalry|one of the most intense rivalries]] in U.S. college sports, an 1895 baseball game between Brigham Young Academy, now [[BYU Cougars|Brigham Young University]], and the [[Utah Utes|University of Utah]], ended in a scoreless tie, immediately followed by a bench-clearing brawl.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595065841/Heated-Utah-and-BYU-rivalry-started-with-a-brawl-in-1895.html |title=Heated Utah and BYU rivalry started with a brawl in 1895 |first=Brad |last=Rock |publisher=[[Deseret News]] |page=1 |date=May 28, 2004 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* This was far from the last violent incident in the baseball version of the Utah–BYU rivalry:
** In one 1966 game, a Utah batter intentionally hit BYU's catcher with his bat.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595065841/Heated-Utah-and-BYU-rivalry-started-with-a-brawl-in-1895.html?pg=2 |title=Heated Utah and BYU rivalry started with a brawl in 1895 |first=Brad |last=Rock |publisher=[[Deseret News]] |page=2 |date=May 28, 2004 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In another game in the mid-1980s, a number of BYU players were heckling Utah's pitcher. The pitcher went into his stretch, and then turned and fired a fastball into the BYU dugout, leading to a bench-clearing brawl.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"/&gt;
** Yet another game in the same era saw a Utah player get a base hit with two outs and two on in the bottom of the ninth inning in a tied game. The lead runner could have scored the winning run uncontested—but he instead went out of his way to run over BYU's catcher, who was standing on the first-base side of home plate (the opposite side from a runner heading for home). The runner was called out and ejected, and BYU went on to win in extra innings.&lt;ref name="Utah-BYU baseball 2"/&gt;
* On August 12, 1984, a game between the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[San Diego Padres]] turned into what writers Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo later called "one of the worst [[beanball]] wars of modern times", starting with Braves pitcher [[Pascual Pérez (baseball)|Pascual Pérez]] [[hit by pitch|hitting]] [[Alan Wiggins]] with the game's first pitch, followed by four attempts by Padres pitchers to hit Pérez in retaliation, and ending in Braves reliever [[Donnie Moore]] hitting [[Graig Nettles]]. The chaos led to four bench-clearing incidents, one of which lasted at least 10&amp;nbsp;minutes; ejections of both managers and 12 players and coaches; multiple suspensions of individuals involved in the fracas; and fan involvement (see above).&lt;ref name="Beanball war"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |work=Page 2 |first=Jeff |last=Merron |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===

* In a 1972 [[college basketball]] game, [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State University]] were leading the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota]] 50–44 with 36&amp;nbsp;seconds left to play in the game. Ohio State's [[Luke Witte]] was fouled hard going to the basket by Minnesota's Corky Taylor, who punched the dazed Witte in the face and kneed him in the groin. Gopher reserve [[Ron Behagen]] then stomped on Witte's neck and head. Witte was not the only victim of violence, as a larger brawl broke out, with two other Gophers, [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] and future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Famer]] [[Dave Winfield]], attacking other Ohio State players. Witte was taken off the court on a stretcher and booed by Minnesota fans. He was the most seriously injured among three Buckeyes players taken to hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.10000takes.com/hall_of_shame/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] game on December 9, 1977, [[Kermit Washington]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] was already fighting with [[Kevin Kunnert]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] when [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] of the Rockets came running toward them. Seeing a man in an opponent uniform rushing at him, Washington instinctively turned and punched Tomjanovich in the face, resulting in a near-fatal season-ending injury to Tomjanovich. The NBA suspended Washington for 60 days (26 games) and fined him $10,000.  A civil jury awarded Tomjanovich $3.2 million.  This incident is the subject of the book ''The Punch'' by [[John Feinstein]].
* On November 19, 2004, the infamous [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] took place in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. It ranks among the worst episodes of sports violence in [[Sports in the United States|American sports]] history.
* On August 19, 2010, the final game of the [[Acropolis International Tournament 2010|Acropolis International Tournament]] between [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]] and [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbia]] at the [[Olympic Indoor Hall]] in Athens ended in a bench-clearing brawl with 2:40 left and Greece leading 74–73. The melee started when Greece's [[Antonis Fotsis]] moved threateningly toward Serbia's [[Miloš Teodosić]] after a hard foul. Teodosic responded by punching Fotsis in the face while [[Nenad Krstić]] also tried to grab the Greek player. Greece's 360&amp;nbsp;lb center [[Sofoklis Schortsanitis]] joined the fight attacking multiple Serbian players and spreading havoc. Krstic punched Schortsanitis several times in his back. When he started pursuing the retreating Krstić, the Serbian player responded by throwing a chair at him. The chair missed Schortsanitis but hit his teammate [[Ioannis Bourousis]] in the head, drawing blood. Players from both teams fought in the tunnel leading from the arena before being separated, and a few fans joined the fight but were quickly taken from the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2010/08/19/friendly-acropolis-tourney-ends-bench-clearing-brawl-forces-abandonment-greece/ |title=Friendly Acropolis tourney ends when bench-clearing brawl forces abandonment of Greece-Serbia |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krstić was arrested by Greek police, but was released the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5478923 |title=Police release Nenad Krstic after melee |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=August 21, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]] responded by suspending two players from each team for part of the subsequent [[2010 FIBA World Championship|FIBA World Championship]].

* Later that year, on October 12, an exhibition match between the [[China national basketball team|China]] and [[Brazil national basketball team|Brazil]] national teams in [[Xuchang]] was marred by rough play from both sides before escalating into open exchanges of kicks and punches, followed by a bench-clearing brawl. After the teams were separated, China players attacked the Brazilians as they were heading to the locker room. Brazil refused to return to the court or to play the fourth and final match in their scheduled series. The Chinese national federation issued an official apology to Brazil the following day. This was the latest in a series of incidents involving the China team that had already resulted in tens of thousands of US$ in fines from both FIBA and [[FIBA Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/olybb/news/story?id=5680189 |title=China apologizes for brawl with Brazil |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=October 13, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, China head coach [[Bob Donewald, Jr.]] was suspended for China's next three FIBA matches; three China players drew suspensions of one or two games; and the three match officials were suspended from FIBA matches for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/presRele/p/newsid/45415/presReleArti.html |title=PR N° 34 – China sanctioned for mass brawl in Brazil friendly |publisher=FIBA |date=December 14, 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 18, 2011, another Chinese team, the [[Bayi Rockets]] of the [[Chinese Basketball Association]], was involved in a major scuffle with the touring [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University men's team]]. After three quarters of highly physical play from both sides, the game turned ugly with the teams tied at 64 with 9:32 remaining in the final quarter. At that point, both benches emptied and the teams began fighting one another. One Georgetown player had a chair thrown at him by an unidentified individual, with reports differing on whether he was hit. Another Georgetown player who had been struck during the brawl picked up a chair in apparent self-defense. As the brawl progressed, some fans joined in the action, with one wielding a stanchion. Hoyas coach [[John Thompson III]] pulled his team from the court; the team had to dodge water bottles and other objects thrown by fans, and one Georgetown fan was reportedly knocked to the ground by a thrown bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/6873726/georgetown-hoyas-chinese-professional-team-game-ends-brawl |title=Georgetown, Chinese pro team brawl |first=Dana |last=O'Neil |publisher=ESPN |date=August 19, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/fight-ends-georgetown-basketball-exhibition-in-china/2011/08/18/gIQAs1zeNJ_story.html |title=Georgetown basketball exhibition in China ends in brawl |first=Gene |last=Wang |work=The Washington Post |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 2, 2018, [[Philippines–Australia basketball brawl |a bench-clearing brawl]] broke out between the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] and [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippines]] men's national teams during a [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)#Group B|qualifier]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]]. With Australia leading by over 30 points with just over 4:00 left in the third quarter, play was halted for a foul. Australia's [[Daniel Kickert]] then swung his elbow at an [[Roger Pogoy|unsuspecting Philippines player]], immediately leading to both benches clearing and a melee spreading from the bench to one of the baskets. When order was restored and game officials reviewed video of the incident, a total of 13 players were ejected—four from Australia (including Kickert) and nine from the Philippines. This left the hosts with only three players to resume the game; after two of the remaining Philippines players fouled out, leaving that team with only one player, the officials called the game, with Australia winning 89–53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/basketball/story/_/id/23974221/milwaukee-bucks-center-thon-maker-brawl-fiba-qualifying-game |title=Bucks center Thon Maker in middle of brawl during FIBA qualifying game |website=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2018-07-02 |accessdate=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThorntonfightingBrookbank.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A fight between [[Shawn Thornton]] and [[Wade Brookbank]]. Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition with a long history.]]
Violence has been a part of [[ice hockey]] since at least the early 1900s. According to the book ''[[Hockey: A People's History]]'', in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork.&lt;ref name="PeopleHistory"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in ice hockey is an established tradition of the sport in North America, with a long history involving many levels of amateur and professional play and including some notable individual fights.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalties]] on players who engage in fights. Unique to North American professional team sports, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not [[ejection (sports)|eject]] players outright for fighting&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but major European and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|collegiate hockey leagues]] do.&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;{{Harvnb|NCAA|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or "heavyweights") knocking each other out, some administrators are not considering eliminating fighting from the game, as some players consider it essential.&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{Harvnb|McIntyre|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the majority of fans oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games.&lt;ref name="Barrie Examiner"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrie Examiner|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an NHL preseason game between the [[Boston Bruins]] and [[St. Louis Blues]] on September 21, 1969, Bruins defenseman [[Ted Green]] and Blues left wing [[Wayne Maki]], attacking Green, engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=13497|title=Legends of Hockey -- NHL Player Search -- Player -- Wayne Maki|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture and brain damage, forcing him to miss the entirety of the [[1969–70 NHL season]], with Maki emerging uninjured. As a result of the fight, Green played for the remaining nine years of his professional career with a pioneering variety of [[hockey helmet]] in both the NHL and WHA.
* April 20, 1984 – A bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the second period of a second-round playoffs matchup between the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]], after many smaller-scale battles had occurred throughout the game. A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 10 players were ejected. This game prompted referee [[Bruce Hood (ice hockey)|Bruce Hood]] to retire from the NHL once the playoffs ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lemieux|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly referred to as the ''[[Good Friday Massacre]]''.
* On January 4, 1987, the final game of the [[1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], involving [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canada]] and the Soviet Union, saw intense physical (and often dirty) play by both sides, culminating in [[Punch-up in Piešťany|a bench-clearing brawl]] that lasted over 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Event organizers, in a futile attempt to stop the fighting, turned the arena lights off. Eventually, the game was declared null and void, and both teams were ejected from the competition, costing the Canadians a medal. Virtually all of the players on the Canadian team got suspended for 18 months, while the Soviet Union players were permanently banned from international competition, and the coaching staffs of both teams were fired. The match referee, widely blamed for losing control of the game, never worked another international match.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{Harvnb|CBC|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book by Gare Joyce was written regarding the event.&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joyce|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 9, 2001 – A game between the [[Nottingham Panthers]] and the [[Sheffield Steelers]] in the British [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] saw "one of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink".  When Sheffield enforcer [[Dennis Vial]] crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer [[Barry Nieckar]] subsequently fought with Vial which eventually escalated into a 36-man bench-clearing brawl. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = BBC | title = Brawl taints Panthers' victory | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1163606.stm | accessdate = 2006-12-29 |publisher=BBC | date=February 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = CBC | title = British league suspends Canadian hockey brawlers | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/02/14/brawlers010214.html | accessdate = 2007-12-24 |publisher = CBC | date=February 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/1171302.stm |title=League punishes teams over brawl |date=February 15, 2001 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 5, 2004 – A Philadelphia Flyers – [[Ottawa Senators]] [[Flyers–Senators brawl|game]] resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goalie [[Robert Esche]] and Senators goalie [[Patrick Lalime]]. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches.  The officials took 90&amp;nbsp;minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.&lt;ref name="Maaddi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maaddi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 9, 2010 – In a [[Kontinental Hockey League]] game between [[Vityaz Chekhov]] and [[Avangard Omsk]], a bench-clearing brawl broke out in the 4th minute of the first period, and a bench- and penalty-box-clearing brawl broke out 39&amp;nbsp;seconds later, forcing officials to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams' coaches were ejected, and a world-record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Lenta.ru | title = Матч КХЛ был сорван массовой дракой хоккеистов | url = http://www.lenta.ru/news/2010/01/09/scuffle/ | accessdate = 2010-01-09 | publisher = lenta.ru | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/9/23770.html|title=This is hockey? |publisher=KHL.ru|date=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.&lt;ref name="bothteamslose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.khl.ru/news/2010/1/10/23771.html|title=Both teams lose|publisher=KHL.ru|date=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
