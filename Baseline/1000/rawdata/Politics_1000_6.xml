The '''1998 killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan''' refers to the siege of the Iranian consulate in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], in the [[Taliban]]-[[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|controlled]] [[Afghanistan]] during the Taliban and [[Northern Alliance]] [[battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)|battles of Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Initially the death of 8 Iranian diplomats was reported, but later two other diplomats and a journalist were also confirmed dead, bringing the total deaths to 11.&lt;ref name="Tehran Times"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Film on 1998 Iranian diplomats’ murder in Mazar-i-Sharif premieres in Tehran|journal=Tehran Times|date=August 25, 2015|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/248916/Film-on-1998-Iranian-diplomats-murder-in-Mazar-i-Sharif-premieres|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killings of the diplomats is speculated to have been carried out by [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;{{cite book|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=The Search for Al Qaeda: Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0451-5|pages=66–67|edition=2nd Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gutman&gt;{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Roy|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|year=2008|publisher=Institute of Peace Press|isbn=978-1-60127-024-5|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Further|Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)}}
Before this incident, Iran was supportive of the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]], and the city of Mazari Sharif was one of the headquarters of the alliance. It is reported that between May and July 1997 [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] executed thousands of Taliban prisoners as a revenge for the 1995 death of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]]. "He is widely believed to have been responsible for the brutal massacre of up to 3,000 Taliban prisoners after inviting them into Mazar-i-Sharif."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1615824.stm#pahlawan |title=Afghan powerbrokers: Who's who |publisher=BBC News |date= November 19, 2001|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a revenge, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif and killed hundreds of Northern Alliance members, particularly members of the Hazara and Uzbek ethnic group as they were accused of being the ones who carried out the killings of Taliban prisoners.

==Events==
On August 8, 1998, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif. After this incident, 11 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent from Iran's state news agency ([[IRNA]]) were attacked at the Iranian consulate and subsequently disappeared. Unofficial reports from the city indicated that all these men were killed. Later it was confirmed that 8 of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA correspondent were killed by the Taliban militia attacking the consulate. The Taliban spokesmen said the Iranians had been killed by renegade forces who had acted without orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Aftermath==
This incident caused a public furor in Iran and many observers were worried Iran would be involved in a military response to the attack. At the time, more than 70,000 Iranian troops were deployed along the Afghan border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''2007 Morocco–Spain diplomatic conflict''' was a short lived disturbance of [[Morocco–Spain relations|international relations between Morocco and Spain]] that arose after the announcement of the impending visit of the [[King of Spain]] to the Spanish-ruled  autonomous cities [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], which are claimed by Morocco.

The dispute formally began when the [[Government of Morocco]] recalled its ambassador to Spain, Omar Azziman. According to a diplomatic note from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco]], "The official announcement on Friday of the unfortunate visit of His Majesty [[King Juan Carlos I]], on 5 and 6 November to the two occupied cities of Ceuta and Melilla is a regrettable initiative, whatever are the motives and objectives."&lt;ref name="elpais1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/expresa/rechazo/viaje/Reyes/Ceuta/Melilla/elpepuesp/20071102elpepinac_16/Tes|title= Marruecos expresa su rechazo al viaje de los Reyes a Ceuta y Melilla|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco expresses its rejection of the King's trip to Ceuta and Melilla|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elpais2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/llama/consultas/embajador/Espana/elpepuesp/20071102elpepunac_12/Tes|title= Marruecos llama a consultas a su embajador en España|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco calls its ambassador in Spain|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reporting of calls of queries from the Ambassador, the Chief Moroccan Government Spokesperson said,"The ball is in the countryside of Spain and we hope that that country takes into consideration the sentiments of the Moroccan people and the interest of bilateral ties and cooperation."&lt;ref name="elpais2"/&gt;

The royal visit occurred in the days set, registering an influx of thousands of citizens, who cheered the Kings in both Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref name="kingatceuta"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/301030/0/ceuties/reciben/reyes/|title= Veinticinco mil personas recibieron en Ceuta a Don Juan Carlos y a Doña Sofía|date= November 5, 2007|publisher= [[20 minutos]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Twenty thousand people to receive Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia in Ceuta|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kingatmelilla"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=1814_43_574968__Espana-Juan-Carlos-destaca-Melilla-sincera-amistad-vecinos|title= Don Juan Carlos destaca en Melilla "la sincera amistad de España con sus vecinos"|date= November 7, 2007|publisher= [[La Nueva España]]|location= Melilla|language= Spanish|trans-title=Don Juan Carlos highlighted at Melilla "the sincere friendship of Spain with its neighbors"|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During those days continued statements against the visit were made by the Moroccan authorities. In this regard, the Prime Minister of Morocco, [[Abbas El Fassi]], compared the situation in both cities with the [[Israeli occupation of Palestine|Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories]] and [[King Mohammed VI]] himself described the visit as an "outdated and nostalgic act of a dark era."&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/equipara/Ceuta/Melilla/Palestina/ocupada/Israel/elpepuesp/20071106elpepinac_5/Tes|title= Marruecos equipara Ceuta y Melilla con la Palestina ocupada por Israel|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 6, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco equates Ceuta and Melilla with Israel occupied Palestine|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="condemnation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Mohamed/VI/condena/visita/real/advierte/Espana/consecuencias/elpepuesp/20071107elpepinac_2/Tes|title= Mohamed VI condena la visita real y advierte a España de las consecuencias|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 7, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Mohamed VI condemned the royal visit of Spain and warned the consequences|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish government, just before the visit, and after the reporting of the Moroccan opposition, told through the Deputy Prime Minister [[Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega]] that the visit of the King of Spain was an act of 'institutional normality."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; Days later, at the initiative of certain groups in Morocco, some hundreds of people carried out protests in [[Tetuan]], as well as front of the border with Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Cientos/personas/reivindican/Tetuan/marroquinidad/Ceuta/Melilla/elpepuesp/20071104elpepunac_2/Tes|title= Cientos de personas reivindican en Tetuán la "marroquinidad" de Ceuta y Melilla|date= November 4, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Hundreds of people claim the "Moroccanness" of Ceuta and Melilla in Tetuan|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moroccan authority also discontinued high-level visits of Spanish authorities to their country.

Finally, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, [[Miguel Angel Moratinos]], visited [[Rabat]] to meet his Moroccan counterpart, [[Taib Fassi Fihri]] on January 3, 2008, and presented him a personal letter from Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to King Mohamed VI, which advocated for closer relations between both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Moratinos/entrega/Marruecos/carta/Zapatero/dara/pie/vuelta/embajador/elpepuesp/20080103elpepunac_1/Tes|title= Moratinos entrega a Marruecos una carta de Zapatero que dará pie a la vuelta del embajador|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= January 3, 2008|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moratinos delivered letter of Zapatero to Morocco will trigger the return of the ambassador|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the Moroccan Foreign Ministry announced the return of its ambassador to Madrid, thus terminating the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/anuncia/regreso/embajador/frio/comunicado/elpepuesp/20080107elpepunac_6/Tes|title= Marruecos anuncia el regreso de su embajador con un frío comunicado|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= January 7, 2008|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco announces the return of its ambassador with a cold statement|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal visit==
[[File:Juan Carlos 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia.]]

On October 30, the [[Government of Spain]] announced the visit of King [[Juan Carlos I]] and Queen [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Sofia]] to Ceuta and Melilla from 5 and 6 November. The day before, the Spanish Prime Minister [[Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]], had told that fact to the opposition leader [[Mariano Rajoy]] during an official ceremony, which Rajoy welcomed.

The King of Spain had not visited Ceuta and Melilla in his reign. The most immediate antecedent of the stay of King Juan Carlos I in these cities dates back to 1970, when he undertook a visit to Ceuta in his capacity as [[Prince of Asturias]] on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Spanish Legion]].

The last visit of a Head of State of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla was by king [[Alfonso XIII]], who was last seen in 1927, and President of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]], [[Niceto Alcala Zamora]], on 4 November 1933.&lt;ref name="elpais6"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Rey/destaca/visita/Ceuta/cumple/compromiso/pendiente/elpepuesp/20071106elpepinac_3/Tes|title= El Rey destaca que su visita a Ceuta cumple un "compromiso pendiente"|first= Tomás|last= Bárbulo|date= November 6, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Ceuta|language= Spanish|trans-title=The King emphasizes that his visit to Ceuta serves a "pending commitment"|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king of Spain was scheduled to visit to the autonomous city of Melilla in 1997 on the occasion of the five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city, but the pressure of the Moroccan authorities led to the cancellation of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/299476/0/visita/oficial/reyes/|title= Los Reyes visitarán por primera vez de forma oficial Ceuta y Melilla|date= October 31, 2007|publisher= [[20 minutos]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=The King will officially visit Ceuta and Melilla for the first time|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, the King and the Queen of Spain stayed in Ceuta for five hours, where they spoke to the [[Assembly of Ceuta|Assembly]] of the Autonomous City, where the monarch said that he "had an pending commitment to Ceuta". Neither the king nor the Minister of Public Administration who accompanied him, [[Elena Salgado]], or any other Spanish authority made any mention of the situation in Morocco.&lt;ref name="elpais6"/&gt; The King was welcomed by 25,000 people.&lt;ref name="kingatceuta"/&gt;

On November 6, the king came to Melilla, in which the Spanish monarch intervened the [[Assembly of Melilla|Assembly]]. There he acknowledged the loyalty of Melillans to the Crown. He made specific reference to Morocco, but said that "Spain through mutual respect cultivates relations of sincere friendship with its neighbors." The number of people who gathered to welcome the King was estimated at 30,000.&lt;ref name="kingatmelilla"/&gt;

==Additional background of the conflict==
A month before the announcement of the royal visit, the judge of the [[National Court of Spain]], [[Baltasar Garzón]], had opened a file to investigate an alleged genocide of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]] by Morocco, accepting to process the lawsuit filed in 2006 by various associations defending human rights and relatives of prisoners and disappeared Saharawis, which accused 31 senior officials of Moroccan security. Morocco, meanwhile, was accused of siding with the positions of the [[Polisario Front]]. Moroccan spokesman said that "it would be good that Judge Garzon deal a bit of respect for human rights in Tindouf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lukor.com/not-esp/internacional/0711/01115819.htm|title= Marruecos dice que Garzón debería preocuparse por los DDHH en Tinduf y no por el presunto genocidio saharaui

As stated by [[Yassine Mansouri]], Foreign Secret Service Chief of Morocco, during a stay in [[Mallorca]], the deterioration of relations is also related to the active position of the Spanish Government and local authorities to untie Muslim believers of Ceuta and the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs of Morocco]]; and to bet on movements like the [[Tablig]] (Congregation for the Propagation of Islam) or the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Mansouri informed this to [[Alberto Saiz]], Director of National Intelligence of Spain.

The position was due to the wrath of King Mohamed VI, according to Mansouri, he remembered that Moroccan King is the ''Commander of the Faithful'' and many mosques in Ceuta had been attached to the [[Union of Islamic Communities of Spain]] (UCIDE) (36 of 40 Islamic communities of Ceuta). The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, [[Laarbi Maateis]], is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with [[jihadism]]. He also said the prosecution were not understandable "because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco and no one has tried to change that, especially because it seems to be the best for the city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://terranoticias.terra.es/provincias/ceuta/articulo/ceuta_espana_marruecos_2113293.htm|title= Maateis recuerda que el rito musulmán malekita se practica 'en Ceuta, en el resto de España y en Marruecos|date= December 11, 2007|publisher= Terra Actualidad|language= Spanish|trans-title=Maateis recalls that Maliki Muslim rites are practiced in Ceuta, in the rest of Spain and in Morocco|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/acusa/Espana/echar/musulmanes/ceuties/brazos/integrismo/elpepuesp/20071210elpepinac_9/Tes|title= Marruecos acusa a España de echar a los musulmanes ceutíes en brazos del integrismo|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 10, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Ceuta|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco accuses Spain to drive the Muslims into the arms of fundamentalist Ceuta|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the Moroccan government==
[[File:Mohammed VI of Morocco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mohamed VI.]]

The [[Prime Minister of Morocco]], [[Abbas El Fassi]], reported the Moroccan parliament that his government would not spare efforts to regain the two cities (Ceuta and Melilla). The next day, November 1, Abbas el Fassi asked the King of Spain to "waive" the trip, while the Minister and Speaker of the Moroccan government, [[Khalid Naciri]], expressed the "total rejection and condemnation" of the royal visit to "despoiled Moroccan cities." Abbas el Fassi, however, at the time said the Spanish press that there was no coercion and that the conflict "must be approached with intelligence, mutual respect, dialogue and concertation."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt;

On November 5, while King Juan Carlos I was visiting Ceuta, Abbas el Fassi compared the situation of Ceuta and Melilla to the Israeli occupation of Palestine during a special session of the Moroccan Parliament to discuss the issue.

{{Quote|Decolonization continues to be topical in the few spots that remain in the world, including occupied Palestine, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla ....}}

The same opinion was pronounced by the leader of the Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party, [[Mustafa Ramid]], by manifesting in the Parliament that "the Moroccans living under Spanish colonization are as our fellow Palestinians under Israeli colonization."&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt;

===Manifestations of King Mohamed VI===
On November 6, after holding a Council of Ministers before intervening in the acts of commemoration of the [[Green March]] in the Parliament, Moroccan King Mohamed VI issued a harsh condemnation through a personnel spokesman:&lt;ref name="condemnation"/&gt;
{{quotation|Strongly we express our strong condemnation and as firmly denounce this unprecedented visit. [...] Given this act was to overcome a nostalgic and dark era, the Spanish authorities must assume their responsibility for the consequences that could jeopardize the future and the development of relations between both countries. [...]}}

In the same statement Mohamed VI called for the formal opening of negotiations on the two cities:
{{quotation|It is well established that the best way to resolve conflict and manage this land requires respect for the virtues of an honest dialogue, frank and open about the future, a dialogue that ensures our right to sovereignty and to take into account the interests of Spain.

===Reactions of the Moroccan government after the visit of the King===
On 15 November, the government spokesman Khalid Naciri, after a Governing Council, stated that he hoped that the Spanish "place their hand into ours to overcome the crisis and privileging our bilateral relationship. The Spanish-Moroccan relations have undergone a crisis." Do not set a date for the return of the ambassador to Madrid, insist on the need for a dialogue between the parties about the future of the Spanish autonomous cities and it is expected for the future that "our Spanish friends will consider our feelings, our sensitivity and our claims; the purpose is not to create difficulties but to preserve our relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/quiere/Espana/le/coja/mano/superar/juntos/crisis/diplomatica/elpepuesp/20071115elpepunac_11/Tes|title= Marruecos quiere que España "le coja la mano" para superar juntos la crisis diplomática|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 15, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco wants Spain "to hold their hand" to overcome diplomatic crisis together|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 16 November, the Government of Morocco suspended two high-level visits of Spanish authorities:that of the [[Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Spain)|Minister of Public Works]], [[Magdalena Álvarez]], who had planned to deal with the Moroccan Minister of Equipment and Transport [[Karim Ghellab]] about the Gibraltar rail tunnel to link the two countries across the [[Strait of Gibraltar|strait]] (an issue on which both are officially working since 2005 when Tangier was treated evolving the fixed links between Europe and Africa and Chief of Staff of the [[Army of Spain]], Admiral [[Sebastian Zaragoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Marruecos/muestra/enfado/cancelando/visita/ministra/Fomento/elpepuint/20071117elpepuint_6/Tes|title= Marruecos muestra su enfado cancelando una visita de la ministra de Fomento|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 17, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco shows its anger by canceling a visit of the Minister of Development|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the Spanish Government==
On the same day, November 1, the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain]], [[Miguel Angel Moratinos]], who was visiting the Moroccan city of [[Marrakech]], reported orally to the Moroccan Foreign Minister [[Taieb Fassi-Fihri]], despite the manifestations of the Prime Minister, that the King of Spain would visit the cities of Ceuta and Melilla on 5 and 6 November as planned. That same day, in the usual appearance of the Government of Spain after the conclusion of the regular meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Second Deputy Prime Minister [[Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega]] said that relations with the Moroccan government "were extraordinary" and the journey of the Kings fell within the "institutional normality."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; Foreign Affairs Minister, Moratinos ruled out an action similar withdrawing the ambassador of Spain in [[Rabat]], Spanish diplomatic sources said.&lt;ref name="elpais3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Mohamed/VI/retira/embajador/pone/relacion/borde/crisis/elpepunac/20071103elpepinac_1/Tes|title= Mohamed VI retira a su embajador y pone la relación al borde de la crisis|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 3, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Mohamed VI withdraws its ambassador and put the relationship on the verge of crisis|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, Defense Minister [[Jose Antonio Alonso]], in a statement to the [[Cadena SER]] said that he hoped the gesture of calling the ambassador-step prior to the breakdown of diplomatic relations, he repeated the words said by Deputy Prime Minister the previous day on the normality of the visit.&lt;ref name="elpais4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Parlamentarios/marroquies/convocan/protesta/Embajada/Espana/lunes/elpepuesp/20071103elpepunac_2/Tes|title= Parlamentarios marroquíes convocan una protesta ante la Embajada de España el lunes|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 3, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moroccan parliamentarians convened a protest outside the Embassy of Spain on Monday|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political reactions in Spain===

The '''2008 US beef protest in South Korea''' was a series of protest demonstrations between 24 May 2008 and about 18 July 2008 in [[Seoul]], [[Korea]]. At its height, the protest involved tens of thousands of people. The protest began after the South Korean government reversed a ban on US beef imports. The ban had been in place since December 2003, when the [[prion]] responsible for [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), or 'mad cow disease' was detected in US beef cattle.&lt;ref name="bbc 7491482"&gt;{{cite news

Unrest was fanned by local media reports such as the [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]] (MBC) ''[[PD Notebook]]'' program "Is American Beef Really Safe from Mad Cow Disease?" televised on 27 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Background ==
Controversy in South Korea over U.S. beef isn't new, but has been largely dormant for the past four years. In 2008, the then new Lee Myung-bak government agreed, after extensive negotiations, to restart imports, which had been halted since cases of mad cow disease were found in the United States in 2003.&lt;ref name="Diplomat"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/05/south-koreas-new-beef-with-u-s/|title=South Korea's New Beef with U.S.|last=Diplomat|first=Steven Borowiec, The|website=The Diplomat|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That decision set off a firestorm of controversy, leading hundreds of thousands of citizens to come out in the spring and early summer of 2008 in protest over the resumed imports. Sensationalist media reports and online rumors fueled speculation that the new president was recklessly putting South Koreans' health at risk of contracting bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as mad cow disease.&lt;ref name="Diplomat"/&gt; The deal has sparked public outrage amid widespread perceptions, fanned in part by sensational media reports, MBC PD Notebook, that it exposes the country to a higher risk of mad cow disease.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/world/asia/30korea.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the protest==
===2003===
On 23 December 2003, a first case of BSE in the US was found in Washington state. The Holstein cow had been imported from Canada in 2001. On 9 December the 6.5-year-old cow was slaughtered. The cow was a "downer" (a cow that is unable to walk). For that reason, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) was automatically notified; and the cow was examined before and after its death by a government vet. The vet determined that the cow was suffering from complications of calving. Samples of tissue were taken for further testing for BSE. Parts of the cow with a high risk of transmitting the BSE prion were removed but may have been sent for "inedible rendering" into food for non-ruminant animals. The carcass itself was allowed to continue on for further processing into human food at other facilities. On 23 December 2003 when tests proved positive for BSE, a recall was made. The contaminated meat had not entered the commercial market. Offspring of the cow were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5253a2.htm] "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a dairy cow – Washington State, 2003". 9 January 2004.

===2006===
By 2006, sixty-five nations had full or partial restrictions on the importation of US beef. Export sales of US beef fell from $3.8 billion in 2003 to $1.4 billion in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-03-our-view_x.htm] "Mad cow watch goes blind." Editorial, ''USA Today'' 3 August 2006. Retrieved 11 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
An attempt to reopen the South Korean market to US beef imports in 2006 (restricted to boneless meat from cattle less than 30 months old) failed when the South Korean government discovered bone chips in a shipment of 3.2 tons of meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeefsite.com/bse-news/14140/] "Second Shipment of U.S. Beef Rejected." 2 December 2006.

===2008 – Lee's reversal of the beef import ban===
On 17 January 2008 representatives of the president of South Korea met with [[Alexander Vershbow]], the U.S. ambassador to South Korea to discuss beef imports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/09/116_94355.html] "Lee made beef deal before Bush talks in 2008."

On 18 April U.S. and South Korean negotiators reached an agreement on the sanitary rules that Korea would require of U.S. beef imports. The agreement allowed imports of all cuts of U.S. beef (both boneless and bone-in) and certain beef products, including those from cattle over 30 months old. Processors had to remove material known to risk BSE prion transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL34528.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311121101/http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL34528.pdf |date=11 March 2012 }} "U.S.-South Korea Beef Dispute: Issues and Status."

Demonstrators accused Lee of reversing the ban on imports of U.S. beef in haste, giving the U.S. unwarranted concessions, so that Korea would receive a favorable reception, particularly with respect to ratifying the proposed free trade agreement. The demonstrators said Lee had abandoned his duty of care to the people of South Korea for political gain by ignoring their concern about BSE prion transmission and by lowering tariffs on imported beef.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7457087.stm] "Question and answer: South Korea beef protests" BBC news. 25 June 2008.

==MBC "PD Notebook" program==
On 27 April 2008, MBC televised a program called "Is American Beef Really Safe from Mad Cow Disease?" The program precipitated mass demonstrations. After a complaint was received from the South Korean agriculture ministry, the Seoul central prosecutors' office formed a team of five to investigate the program's content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2891646] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130127065553/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2891646 |date=27 January 2013 }} "Prosecutors expanding probe into TV report".

===Downer cows===
''Downer'' cows are animals presented for slaughter that are sick or unable to walk. One of many causes for a downer is BSE. MBC was criticised for broadcasting footage of downer cows with translated subtitles that suggested they suffered from BSE, whereas they were filmed because of animal cruelty concerns, not BSE.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892992] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130126202607/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2892992 |date=26 January 2013 }} "Prosecutors say PD Diary deliberately twisted facts."

== Reaction to "PD Notebook" ==
Demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people began shortly after the first broadcast, and increased when MBC aired another segment two weeks later.

===Korean communications commission===
MBC became the subject of legal action. On 12 August 2008, the [[Korea Communications Commission]] called for MBC to apologise to the public over misrepresentations made in the PD notebook program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/08/113_29254.html] "MBC offers apology over US beef report." ''Korea Times'' 13 August 2008. Retrieved 13 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
MBC apologised a two-minute broadcast, saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We would like to offer a sincere apology to our viewers [over the report].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

MBC conceded that six translation errors had been made and that downer cattle had been mistakenly identified as suffering from BSE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121210143445/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-eastasia.asp?parentid=95873] "MBC offers apology over US beef report."

===MBC versus Government===
The government of South Korea directed its prosecutors office to investigate alleged actions of the MBC including mis-representations made by the PD Notebook program; aggravation of civil unrest; and, defamation of the minister for agriculture. In June 2009, four producers and one writer were indicted on the charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/south-korea/report-2010] "South Korea – Amnesty International Report 2010."

===Influence of social media===
Internet and text messaging also assisted in publicising the movement. With ready access to social media, among the first to protest were teenage schoolgirls. A teenage schoolgirl holding a lit candle became the symbol of the anti-US beef protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/11554714] "Ill met by candlelight" 12 June 2008. ''The Economist''.

===The demonstrators===
After the initial demonstration, the area in front of Seoul's city hall, as well as the adjoining streets, were occupied by demonstrators. Early in the protest, a festival like atmosphere prevailed as protesters of all walks of life, built a makeshift tent city on the lawn at [[Seoul Plaza]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/06/117_25435.html] "Gone is solemnity at rallies" Kim, Rahn.

Retrieved 15 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some massive, disruptive and sometimes aggressive demonstrations and street marches were held each night, particularly at weekends.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/06/117_25901.html] "Seoul plaza suffering under mass rallies" 15 June 2008.

===Police action===
On 1 June 2008, police took action to control demonstrators. Buses and shipping containers were used to halt the progress of street marches. A barrier of shipping containers were erected across Sejong-Ro to stop marchers from reaching [[Cheongwadae]] (office and residence of the president). The protestors named the barrier, "Myung-bak's Fortress" and decorated it with leaflets and large Korean flags. They photographed themselves standing on the barrier. It was dismantled several days later without conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/06/117_25722.html] "Container barricade draws spotlight."

&lt;blockquote&gt; The protests were for the most part peaceful and given its size and duration, both the protesters and the police showed notable organization and restraint. However, there were sporadic incidents of violence, as riot police and protesters clashed. The two main flashpoints of violence occurred on 31 May/1 June, when the police first used water cannons and fire extinguishers, and 28/29 June, the weekend following the government's announcement that US beef imports would resume. The decision to use water cannons and fire extinguishers contributed to the mass resignation of all 14 members of the Korean National Police Agency's human rights committee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa25/008/2008/en/] "Policing the candlelight protests in South Korea".

===Korean government===
The [[approval rating]] of Lee fell below 20%. Prime Minister Han Seung-soo and other cabinet members submitted their resignations to President Lee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/world/asia/10korea.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin] "S. Korean cabinet offers to quit after beef protests" Choe, Sang-hun. 10 June 2008. ''The New York Times'' Accessed 15 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 May and then again on 18 June 2008, Lee apologised for ignoring public health concerns.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSSEO20019820080602] "South Korea delays resumption of U.S. beef imports."

&lt;blockquote&gt;I should have paid attention to what people want. Sitting on a hill near Cheongwadae on the night of 10 June, watching the candlelight vigil, I blamed myself for not serving the people better.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lee also delayed the announcement of any further relaxation of beef importation rules, for example, importation of meat from cattle over 30 months of age.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;
On 2 July 2008, [[Han Seung-soo]], [[Prime Minister of South Korea]] bought 260,000 [[Korean won]] (roughly US$230–$260) worth of U.S. [[steak]] to eat with his family at his official residence to alleviate public worries about U.S. beef. The same amount of Korean beef would have cost approximately 800,000 [[Korean won]] (roughly $700–$800, three times more expensive than imported U.S. beef).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4fc507ec-4852-11dd-a851-000077b07658.html] "Seoul struggles to defuse US beef imports."

===US===
On 22 June 2008, an American trade envoy headed by Susan C. Schwab, agreed with the Korean prime minister and agriculture minister to limit the export of meat to that from carcasses of cattle less than 30 months old with government certification of their age and to allow Korea to inspect a sample of U.S. slaughterhouses. The agreement also included the banning of importation to Korea of meat from cattle organs considered high risk for transmission of the BSE prion such as brains, eyes, skulls and spinal cord. Schwab said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We look forward to safe, affordable, high-quality American beef – the same beef enjoyed by hundreds of millions of U.S. consumers and people in countries around the world – soon arriving on Korean tables.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/world/asia/22korea.html] "South Korea and US reach deal on beef imports." Choe, Sang-hun. 22 June 2008. ''New York Times'' Accessed 15 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Tom Casey (diplomat)|Tom Casey]], deputy spokesman at the [[U.S. State Department]] rejected the notion that the U.S. had bullied S. Korea into removing the 2003 ban on U.S. beef imports and said,

From December 2009 to December 2010 the US meat export federation (USMEF) used a 3 phase project called, "To trust". It was an image campaign, designed to increase the trust of Koreans in US beef. It depicted three women who were mothers and homemakers.

In 2009, a small number of demonstrators commemorated the anniversary of the 2008 protests. They forcibly occupied the [[Hi! Seoul Festival]] stage in front of the city hall in central Seoul.

===Commentators===
Kim Dae-joong (not to be confused with former Korean President and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Kim Dae-jung]]), a columnist at the ''Korea Times'', wrote in his editorial piece: "It amounts to double-crossing to be really fond of America in all substantive matters, while bad-mouthing America in public protests."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/include/print.asp?newsIdx=24696] "beef and anti-Americanism."

'''Anti-Zionism''' is opposition to [[Zionism]]. The term is broadly defined in the modern era as the opposition to the [[ethnonationalist]] and political movement of [[Jews]] and [[Jewish culture]] that supports the establishment of a [[Jewish state]] as a [[Jewish homeland]] in the territory defined as the historic [[Land of Israel]] (also referred to as [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Canaan]], or the [[Holy Land]]). Anti-Zionism is also defined as opposition to the [[State of Israel]].

The term is used to describe various religious, moral and political points of view, but their diversity of motivation and expression is sufficiently different that "anti-Zionism" cannot be seen as having a single ideology or source.  There is also a difference between how it is discussed philosophically and how it is enacted within a political or social campaign.&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;Halpern, Gilad, host.  [https://tlv1.fm/the-tel-aviv-review/2017/11/17/left-handed-compliments-anti-semitic-discourse-among-progressives/ "Left Handed Compliments ...."] ''The Tel Aviv Review'', TLV1 Podcasts.  17 November 2017.  See discussion beginning at 22:33.&lt;/ref&gt; Many notable Jewish and non-Jewish sources take the view that anti-Zionism has become a cover for modern-day [[antisemitism]], a position that critics have challenged as a tactic to silence [[criticism of the Israeli government|criticism of Israeli policies]]. Others, such as [[Steven M. Cohen]], [[Brian Klug]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug]], [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/03/comment No, Zionism is not anti-semitism] [[The Guardian]] 3 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Todd Gitlin]], see no correlation between the two.&lt;ref name="Zeveloff" /&gt;

==History==

{{main article|Timeline of anti-Zionism}}
{{see also|History of Zionism|History of antisemitism}}

==Jewish anti-Zionism==
Jewish anti-Zionism is as old as Zionism itself, and enjoyed widespread support in the Jewish  community until World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Marqusee]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=2llC2XJgwdwC&amp;pg=PR7 ''If I Am Not For Myself: Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew,'']   [[Verso Books]] (2008) 2010 p.vii:’As long as there has been Zionism, there have been anti-Zionist Jews. Indeed, decades before it even came to the notice of non-Jews, anti-Zionism was a well-established Jewish ideology and until World War 11 commanded wide support in the diaspora.’&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jewish community is not a single united group and responses vary both among and within Jewish groups. One of the principal divisions is that between [[secular Jews]] and [[religious Jews]]. The reasons for secular opposition to the Zionist movement are very different from those of religious Jews.  Opposition to a Jewish state has changed over time and has taken on a diverse spectrum of religious, ethical and political positions.

The legitimacy of anti-Zionist views has been disputed to the present day, including the more recent and disputed relationship between anti-Zionism and [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="Wist1"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Before 1948===

There is a long tradition of Jewish anti-Zionism that has opposed the Zionist project from its origins. The [[Bundism|Bundists]], [[Jewish Autonomism|the Autonomists]], [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[World Agudath Israel|Agude]] regarded both the rationale and territorial ambitions of Zionism as flawed. [[Orthodox Judaism]], which grounds civic responsibilities and patriotic feelings in religion, was strongly opposed to Zionism because, though the two shared the same values, Zionism espoused nationalism in secular fashion, and used "Zion", "Jerusalem", "Land of Israel", "redemption" and "ingathering of exiles" as literal rather than sacred terms, endeavouring to achieve them in this world.&lt;ref name="Zionism and Religion"&gt;S. Almog, [[Jehuda Reinharz]], [[Anita Shapira]] (eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mS6oW4TTuwkC&amp;pg=PA111 Zionism and Religion]'', UPNE, 1998 citing [[Isaac Breuer]],''Judenproblem'', Halle 1918 p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Jews also opposed the creation of a [[Jewish state]] prior to the appearance of the [[Messiah in Judaism|messiah]], as contradicting divine will.&lt;ref name="shapira"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Shapira | first = Anita |authorlink=Anita Shapira | title = Israel a history | publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson| location = London | page = 15 | date = 2014 | isbn =9780297871583}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, reform Jews rejected Judaism as a national or ethnic identity, and renounced any messianic expectations of the advent of a Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Ross [https://books.google.com/books?id=4zGOUAnfr5MC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious====
Hope for return to the land of Israel is embodied in the content of the Jewish religion (see [[Kibbutz Galuyot]]). ''[[Aliyah]]'', the Hebrew word meaning "ascending" or "going up", is the word used to describe religious Jewish return to Israel, and has been used since ancient times. From the [[Middle Ages]] and onwards, many famous rabbis and often their followers returned to the land of Israel. These have included [[Nahmanides]], [[Yechiel of Paris]], [[Isaac Luria]], [[Yosef Karo]], [[Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk]] among others. For [[Jewish diaspora|Jews in the Diaspora]] ''[[Eretz Israel]]'' was revered in a religious sense. They prayed, and thought of the return, as being fulfilled in a messianic age.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. R. Taylor|Taylor, A. R.]], 1971, ''Vision and intent in Zionist Thought'', pp. 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Return remained a recurring theme for generations, particularly in [[Passover]] and [[Yom Kippur]] prayers, which traditionally concluded with, "[[Next year in Jerusalem]]", as well as the thrice-daily ''[[Amidah]]'' (Standing prayer).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Following [[Jewish Enlightenment]] however, [[Reform Judaism]] dropped many traditional beliefs, including ''aliyah'', as incompatible with modern life within the Diaspora. Later, Zionism re-kindled the concept of ''aliyah'' in an ideological and political sense, parallel with traditional religious belief; it was used to increase Jewish population in the Holy Land by immigration and it remains a basic tenet of Zionist ideology. Support for aliyah does not always equal immigration however, as a majority of the world Jewish population remains within the Diaspora. Support for the modern Zionist movement is not universal and, as a result, some religious Jews as well as some secular Jews do not support Zionism. [[Non-Zionism|Non-Zionist]] Jews are not necessarily anti-Zionists, although some are. Generally however, Zionism does have the support of the majority of the Jewish religious organizations, with support from segments of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] movement, and most of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and more recently, the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rachael Gelfman, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/LandIsrael/modern_landisrael/ReligiousZionism.htm "Religious Zionists believe that the Jewish return to Israel hastens the Messiah"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehud Bandel – President, the Masorti Movement, [http://www.uscj.org/Zionism7161.html "Zionism"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccarnet.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=42&amp;pge_prg_id=4687&amp;pge_id=1656 |title=Reform Judaism &amp; Zionism: A Centenary Platform |date=27 October 2004 |publisher=[[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] |location=[[Miami]], [[Florida]] |access-date=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125135118/http://ccarnet.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=42&amp;pge_prg_id=4687&amp;pge_id=1656 |archive-date=25 November 2011 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Hasidic]] rabbis oppose the creation of a Jewish state. The leader of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidic group, Rabbi [[Joel Teitelbaum]]'s book, ''[[Vayoel Moshe|VaYoel Moshe]]'', published in 1958, expounds one &lt;!-- opposing? --&gt; Orthodox position on Zionism, based on a literal form of ''[[midrash]]'' (biblical interpretation). Citing to Tractate Kesubos 111a of the [[Talmud]] Teitelbaum states that God and the Jewish people exchanged [[the Three Oaths|three oaths]] at the time of the Jews' exile from ancient Israel, forbidding the Jewish people from massively immigrating to the Land of Israel, and from rebelling against the nations of the world.

====Secular====

Prior to the Second World War many Jews regarded Zionism as a fanciful and unrealistic movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMjh319vnwAC A History of Zionism]'', (Schocken Books, New York 1978, {{ISBN|0-8052-0523-3}}), pp385-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Many liberals during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had argued that Jews should enjoy full equality only on the condition that they pledge their singular loyalty to their nation-state and entirely assimilate to the local national culture; they called for the "regeneration" of the Jewish people in exchange for rights. Those liberal Jews who accepted integration and/or assimilation principles saw Zionism as a threat to efforts to facilitate Jewish citizenship and equality within the European nation-state context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMjh319vnwAC A History of Zionism]'', p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish Anti-Zionist League]], in Egypt, was a Communist-influenced anti-Zionist league in the years 1946–1947. In [[Israel]], there are several Jewish anti-Zionist organisations and politicians, many of these are related to [[Matzpen]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===After World War II and the creation of Israel===
Attitudes changed during and following the war. In May 1942, before the full revelation of the [[Holocaust]], the [[Biltmore Program]] proclaimed a fundamental departure from traditional Zionist policy of a "homeland"&lt;ref name="AJYB 1943 pp 206-214"&gt;''American Jewish Year Book'' Vol. 45 (1943–1944) [http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1943_1944_5_USCivicPolitical.pdf "Pro-Palestine and Zionist Activities"], pp. 206–214&lt;/ref&gt; with its demand "that [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] be established as a Jewish Commonwealth". Opposition to official Zionism's firm, unequivocal stand caused some prominent Zionists to establish their own party, [[Ichud]] (Unification), which advocated an Arab – Jewish Federation in Palestine. Opposition to the Biltmore Program also led to the founding of the anti-Zionist [[American Council for Judaism]].&lt;ref name="AJYB 1943 pp 206-214" /&gt;

The full knowledge of the [[Holocaust]] altered the views of many who critiqued Zionism before 1948, including the British journalist [[Isaac Deutscher]], a socialist and lifelong [[atheist]] who nevertheless emphasised the importance of his Jewish heritage. Before [[World War II]], Deutscher opposed Zionism as economically retrograde and harmful to the cause of [[international socialism]], but in the aftermath of the Holocaust he regretted his pre-war views, arguing for Israel's establishment as a "historic necessity" to provide a refuge for the surviving [[Jews of Europe]]. In the 1960s, Deutscher renewed his criticism of Zionism, scrutinizing Israel for its failure to recognise the dispossession of the [[Palestinians]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Other objections relate to the [[Demographics of Israel|maintenance of a Jewish majority]] within the present state of Israel.

[[Post-Zionism]], a related term, has been criticized as being equivalent to anti-Zionism.&lt;ref name="meforum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meforum.org/185/post-zionism-and-israeli-politics | title=Post-Zionism and Israeli Politics: A briefing by Limor Livnat | publisher=Middle East Forum | date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Orthodox religious groups have accepted and actively support the State of Israel, even if they have not adopted "Zionist" ideology. The [[World Agudath Israel]] party (founded in Poland) has at times participated in Israeli government coalitions. Most religious Zionists hold pro-Israel views from a right-wing viewpoint. The main exceptions are Hasidic groups such as [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Hasidim, which have about 100,000 adherents worldwide, as well as numerous different, smaller Hasidic groups, unified in America in the [[Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada]] and in Israel in the [[Edah HaChareidis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com Jews Against Zionism website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226024643/http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/ |date=26 February 2009 }} Retrieved 4 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truetorahjews.org/ Jews Against Zionism website] Retrieved 22 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Novak]] writes that many Jewish anti-Zionists resent the way Zionism 'mak(es) ''Jewishly'' unwarranted claims on them and other Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Novak]], 2015 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6WUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jonathan Judaken]], 'numerous Jewish traditions have insisted that preservation of what is most precious about Judaism and Jewishness "demands" a principled anti-Zionism or post-Zionism.' This tradition dwindled in the aftermath of the Holocaust, and the establishment of Israel but is still alive in religious groups such as [[Neturei Karta]] and among many intellectuals of Jewish background in both Israel and the diaspora, such as [[George Steiner]], [[Tony Judt]] and [[Baruch Kimmerling]] .&lt;ref name="Judaken"&gt;[[Jonathan Judaken]], "Rethinking the New Antisemitism", in Jonathan Judaken (ed.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=haraAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 Naming Race, Naming Racisms]'', Routledge, 2013 pp. 195-223 pp. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has reported a change in the boundaries of what are considered Zionist and anti-Zionist views.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Peck (pacifist)|Peck, James]] (ed.) (1987). ''Chomsky Reader''. {{ISBN|0-394-75173-6}}. p. 7. "what was then called 'Zionist' ... are now called 'anti-Zionist' (concerns and views)".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, in his youth, Chomsky's support for a socialist [[binational state]], in conjunction with his opposition to any semblance of a theocratic system of governance in Israel, was at the time considered well within the mainstream of secular Zionism; today, it lands him solidly in the anti-Zionist camp.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Peck (pacifist)|Peck, James]] (ed.) (1987). ''Chomsky Reader''. {{ISBN|0-394-75173-6}}. p. 7 &lt;blockquote&gt;"I was interested in socialist, binationalist options for Palestine, and in the kibbutzim and the whole cooperative labor system that had developed in the Jewish settlement there (the Yishuv).... The vague ideas I had at the time [1947] were to go to Palestine, perhaps to a kibbutz, to try to become involved in efforts at Arab-Jewish cooperation within a socialist framework, opposed to the deeply antidemocratic concept of a Jewish state."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]''. 31 January 2007. Retrieved 19 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenfeld's general claims are:
#"At a time when the de-legitimization and, ultimately, the eradication of Israel is a goal being voiced with mounting fervor by the enemies of the Jewish state, it is more than disheartening to see Jews themselves adding to the vilification. That some do so in the name of Judaism itself makes the nature of their assault all the more grotesque."
#"Their contributions to what's becoming normative discourse are toxic. They're helping to make [anti-Semitic] views about the Jewish state respectable – for example, that it's a Nazi-like state, comparable to South African apartheid; that it engages in ethnic cleansing and genocide. These charges are not true and can have the effect of delegitimizing Israel."

Some Jewish organizations oppose Zionism as an integral part of their [[anti-imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First National Jewish Anti-Zionist Gathering |url=http://www.jewsconfrontapartheid.org/ |publisher=Jews Confront Apartheid |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not In Our Name ...

Many oppose it as a form of nationalism, which they argue to be a product of capitalist societies. One secular anti-Zionist group today is the [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]], a socialist, anti-war, and anti-imperialist organization that calls for "the dismantling of Israeli apartheid, the return of Palestinian refugees, and the ending of the Israeli colonization of historic Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the International Jewish anti-Zionist Network |url=http://www.ijsn.net/about_us/charter/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804180125/http://www.ijsn.net/about_us/charter/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2012 |publisher=International Jewish anti-Zionist Network |accessdate=29 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the Jewish community==
===Palestinians===
Anne de Jong asserts that direct resistance from inhabitants of [[historic Palestine]] "focused less on religious arguments and was instead centred on countering the experience of colonial dispossession and opposing the Zionist enforcement of ethnic division of the indigenous population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jong|first1=Anne de|title=Zionist hegemony, the settler colonial conquest of Palestine and the problem with conflict: a critical genealogy of the notion of binary conflict|journal=Settler Colonial Studies|date=3 May 2017|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/2201473X.2017.1321171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian Christian owned [[Falastin (newspaper)|Falastin]] was founded in 1911 in the then Arab-majority city of [[Jaffa]]. The newspaper is often described as one of the most influential newspapers in historic Palestine, and probably the nation's fiercest and most consistent critic of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement. It helped shape Palestinian identity and [[Palestinian Nationalism|nationalism]] and was shut down several times by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|British]] authorities, most of the time due to complaints made by Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYADAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=rashid+khalidi+the+iron+cage&amp;hl=ar&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood|author=[[Rashid Khalidi]]|accessdate=25 January 2016|publisher=Beacon Press|date=9 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Anderson writes that Hope Simpson was also "wary of the gulf between Zionist rhetoric and practice, observing that 'The most lofty sentiments are ventilated in public meetings and in Zionist propaganda' but that the [[Jewish National Fund]] and other organs of the movement did not uphold or embody a vision of cooperation or mutual benefit with the Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Charles|title=The British Mandate and the crisis of Palestinian landlessness, 1929–1936|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=6 November 2017|pages=1–45|doi=10.1080/00263206.2017.1372427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Zionism in the Arab world emerged at the end of the 19th century, very soon after the First Zionist Congress was held in Basel in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beška |first=Emanuel |title=Responses Of Prominent Arabs Towards Zionist Aspirations And Colonization Prior To 1908 |journal=Asian and African Studies |volume=16 |issue= |year=2007 |url=https://www.academia.edu/5466913/RESPONSES_OF_PROMINENT_ARABS_TOWARDS_ZIONIST_ASPIRATIONS_AND_COLONIZATION_PRIOR_TO_1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only after the Young Turk revolution in 1908 did opposition to Zionism in Palestine and Greater Syria became widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beška |first=Emanuel |title=Political Opposition to Zionism in Palestine and Greater Syria: 1910–1911 as a Turning Point |journal=Jerusalem Quarterly |volume=59 |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/8377489/Political_Opposition_to_Zionism_in_Palestine_and_Greater_Syria_1910_1911_as_a_Turning_Point}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher [[Michael Neumann]], Zionism as an "expansionist threat" has caused Arab hostility toward Israel and even antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Neumann, [http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann0604.html "What is antisemitism?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133837/http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann0604.html |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]'', 4 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabist]] narratives in the 1960s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] era emphasized the idea of Palestine as a part of the [[Arab world]] taken by others.  In this narrative, the natural means of combating Zionism is Arab nations uniting and attacking Israel militarily.

Most [[Arab citizens of Israel]] do not have strong anti-Zionist views.  A poll of 507 [[Arab-Israeli]]s conducted by the [[Israeli Democracy Institute]] in 2007 found that 75 percent profess support for Israel's status as a [[Jewish and democratic state]] that guarantees equal rights for minorities.  Israeli Arab support for a constitution in general was 88 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853564.html |title=Poll of Arab-Israeli |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=23 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501032449/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853564.html |archivedate=1 May 2007 |df= }}&lt;!--not at archive.org --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian and other Muslim groups, as well as the [[government of Iran]] (since the [[1979 Islamic Revolution]]), insist that the State of Israel is illegitimate and refuse to refer to it as "Israel", instead using the locution "the [[Zionist entity]]" (see [[Iran–Israel relations]]). Islamic maps of the Middle East frequently do not show the State of Israel. In an interview with ''[[Time Magazine]]'' in December 2006, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] said "Everyone knows that the Zionist regime is a tool in the hands of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom|British governments]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570714,00.html | work=Time | title=People Who Mattered: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad | date=16 December 2006 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its strong historic support for [[Christian Zionism|Restorationism]], famously by [[Robert Murray M'Cheyne|Robert Murray M'Chyene]] and by both [[Horatius Bonar|Horatius]] and [[Andrew Bonar]], in April 2013 the [[Church of Scotland]] published [[The Church of Scotland#.22The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the Promised Land.22|"The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the Promised Land"]], which rejected the idea of a special right of Jewish people to the Holy Land through analysis of scripture and Jewish theological claims. The report further denied the "belief among some Jewish people that they have a right to the land of Israel as a compensation for the suffering of the Holocaust" and argued "it is a misuse of the Bible to use it as a topographic guide to settle contemporary conflicts over land." The report was criticised by Jewish leaders in Scotland as "biased, weak on sources, and contradictory. The picture it paints of both Judaism and Israel is barely even a caricature."&lt;ref name=htz2&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/church-of-scotland-jews-do-not-have-a-right-to-the-land-of-israel.premium-1.518932 |title=Church of Scotland: Jews do not have a right to the land of Israel A new church report challenging Jewish historic claims and criticizing Zionism has drawn anger and harsh condemnation from the local Jewish community. |work=Haaretz |accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scojec"&gt;{{cite web

===Soviet Union===
{{Main article|Soviet anti-Zionism|Soviet Union and the Arab-Israeli conflict|History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union}}

During the last years of Stalin's rule, official support for the creation of Israel in 1948 was replaced by strong anti-zionism. The level of confrontation with those deemed as anti-Soviet "Jewish nationalists" was toned down after Stalin's death in 1953, but the official position of opposition to Zionism remained in force: the [[Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public]], as well as numerous other initiatives, were state-sponsored.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

As outlined in the third edition of the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] (1969–1978), the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]'s position during the [[Cold War]] became: "the main posits of modern Zionism are militant [[chauvinism]], racism, [[anti-Communism]] and [[anti-Sovietism]], [...] overt and covert fight against freedom movements and the USSR."&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://encycl.yandex.ru/art.xml?art=bse/00071/37300.htm&amp;encpage=bse&amp;mrkp=http%3A//hghltd.yandex.com/yandbtm%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A//encycl.yandex.ru/texts/bse/00071/37300.htm%26text%3D%25F1%25E8%25EE%25ED%25E8%25E7%25EC%26reqtext%3D%25F1%25E8%25EE%25ED%25E8%25E7%25EC%253A%253A781659%26%26isu%3D2 Сионизм], Большая советская энциклопедия (Zionism. [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition. 1969–1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
Anti-Zionist sentiments were also manifested in organisations such as the [[Organization for African Unity]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which passed resolutions condemning Zionism and equating it with racism and [[apartheid]] during the early 1970s. This culminated in the passing by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] of [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]] in November 1975, which declared "Zionism is a form of racism."&lt;ref name="'70s 320"&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 320|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was revoked on 16 December 1991, when the General Assembly passed [[UN General Assembly Resolution 4686|Resolution 4686]], repealing resolution 3379, by a vote of 111 to 25, with 13 abstentions and 17 delegations absent. Thirteen out of the 19 Arab countries, including those engaged in negotiations with Israel, voted against the repeal, another six were absent. No Arab country voted for repeal. The [[Palestine Liberation Organisation]] denounced the vote. All of the ex-communist countries and most of the African countries who had supported Resolution 3379 voted to repeal it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86 voting record|url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1393W3771T827.32837&amp;profile=voting&amp;uri=full=3100023~!480953~!65&amp;ri=3&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African-American===
After [[Israel]] occupied [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] territory following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], some African-Americans supported the Palestinians and criticized Israel's actions, for example by publicly supporting Palestinian leader [[Yassir Arafat]] and calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Mark, "African American-Jewish Relations" in ''Antisemitism: a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution, Vol 1'', 2005. pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the war, the [[black power]] organization [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] published a newsletter criticizing Israel, and asserting that the war was an effort to regain Palestinian land and that during the 1948 war, "[[Zionists]] conquered the Arab homes and land through terror, force, and massacres."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clayborne Carson|Carson, Clayborne]], (1984) "Blacks and Jews in the Civil Rights movement: the Case of SNCC", in ''Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States'', (Adams, Maurianne, Ed.), 2000., p. 583&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, philosopher [[Cornel West]] wrote: "Jews will not comprehend what the symbolic predicament and literal plight of Palestinians in Israel means to blacks.... Blacks often perceive the Jewish defense of the state of Israel as a second instance of naked group interest, and, again, an abandonment of substantive moral deliberation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornel West|West, Cornel]], ''Race Matters'', 1993, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; African-American support of Palestinians is frequently due to the consideration of Palestinians as people of color – political scientist [[Andrew Hacker]] writes: "The presence of Israel in the Middle East is perceived as thwarting the rightful status of people of color. Some blacks view Israel as essentially a white and European power, supported from the outside, and occupying space that rightfully belongs to the original inhabitants of Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hacker, Andrew]] (1999) "Jewish Racism, Black anti-Semitism", in ''Strangers &amp; neighbors: relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States'', Maurianne Adams (Ed.).

Wayne State University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8143-2548-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Unsurprisingly, recent research has shown a close correlation between anti-Israeli views and anti-Semitic views based on a survey of citizens in ten European countries."&lt;ref name="kaplan-small"&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Edward H. | last1 = Kaplan | authorlink=Edward H.

Professor [[Robert S. Wistrich]], head of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], is the originator of Marcus's second view of anti-Zionism (that anti-Zionism and antisemitism merged post-1948) argues that much contemporary anti-Zionism, particularly forms that compare Zionism and Jews with [[Hitler]] and the [[Third Reich]], has become a form of antisemitism: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Anti-Zionism has become the most dangerous and effective form of anti-Semitism in our time, through its systematic [[Delegitimization of Israel|delegitimization]], defamation, and demonization of Israel. Although not ''[[wiktionary:a priori|a priori]]'' anti-Semitic, the calls to dismantle the Jewish state, whether they come from Muslims, [[Left-wing|the Left]], or the radical [[Right-wing|Right]], increasingly rely on an anti-Semitic stereotypization of classic themes, such as the manipulative 'Jewish lobby,' the Jewish/Zionist 'world conspiracy,' and Jewish/Israeli "warmongers".&lt;ref name = "Wist3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Wistrich | first=Robert S. | authorlink = Robert S. Wistrich | title=Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism | url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=254&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=1064 | journal = Jewish Political Studies Review | date=Fall 2004 | volume = 16 | issue = 3–4 | issn = | accessdate=26 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, I believe that the more radical forms of anti-Zionism that have emerged with renewed force in recent years do display unmistakable analogies to European anti-Semitism immediately preceding the [[Holocaust]].... For example, 'anti-Zionists' who insist on comparing Zionism and the Jews with Hitler and the Third Reich appear unmistakably to be de facto anti-Semites, even if they vehemently deny the fact! ... For if Zionists are 'Nazis' and if [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] really is Hitler, then it becomes a moral obligation to wage war against Israel.  ... Anti-Zionism is ... also the lowest common denominator and the bridge between the Left, the Right, and the militant Muslims; between the elites (including the media) and the masses; between the churches and the mosques; between an increasingly anti-American Europe and an endemically [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] Arab-Muslim Middle East; a point of convergence between conservatives and radicals and a connecting link between fathers and sons."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dina Porat]] (head of the [[Stephen Roth Institute|Institute for Study of Antisemitism and Racism]] at [[Tel-Aviv University]]) contends that anti-Zionism is antisemitic because it is discriminatory: &lt;blockquote&gt;... antisemitism is involved when the belief is articulated that of all the peoples on the globe (including the [[Palestinians]]), only the Jews should not have the right to self-determination in a land of their own. Or, to quote noted human rights lawyer [[David Matas]]: One form of antisemitism denies access of Jews to goods and services because they are Jewish. Another form of antisemitism denies the right of the Jewish people to exist as a people because they are Jewish.

[[United Kingdom|British]] sociologist [[David Hirsh]] wrote a book called ''Contemporary Left Antisemitism'' in which he studied anti-Zionism [[Empiricism|empirically]].  Philosophically, one might privately find under a set of theoretical circumstances that it is possible to be an anti-Zionist without being an antisemite, but according to Hirsh's book, "When anti-Zionism gets a foothold [in an organization] and becomes popular and normal and legitimate, it brings antisemitism with it."&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

According to the December 1969 issue of ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'', a student attacked Zionism in the presence of Dr. [[Martin Luther King]], an American civil rights activist.  King responded to the student, "When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You're talking anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/martin-luther-king-on-anti-zionism "Martin Luther King on Anti-Zionism."] ''Jewish Virtual Library''.  21 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israelis|Israeli]] journalist [[Ben-Dror Yemini]] maintains that anti-Zionism is "[[politically correct]] [[antisemitism]]" and argues that the same way Jews were demonized, Israel is demonized, the same way the right of Jews to exist was denied, the right for [[Self-determination]] is denied from Israel, the same way Jews were presented as a menace to the world, Israel is presented as a menace to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben-Dror Yemini]], [http://www.nrg.co.il/app/index.php?do=blog&amp;encr_id=f2b4c1b55be76d1e6d7b777256ea0370&amp;id=1173 בן-דרור, תרגיע], [[Nrg Maariv|nrg]] ''[[Maariv]]'', 28 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israeli Americans|Israeli American]] journalist [[Liel Leibovitz]] says that 21st century "anti-Zionists" do not like Jews whether they live in Israel or anywhere else in the world.

[[United Kingdom|British]] socialist Adam Langleben had been a supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] all of his life until its leader, [[Jeremy Corbyn]], was caught on video accusing "Zionists" of lacking a sense of irony possessed by other British citizens.  Although Corbyn used the word "Zionist" and not the word "Jew," Langleben asserted, "[F]or any Jewish person watching the video we will have heard ‘Jew,’ because most Jews in Britain subscribe to being a Zionist or supportive of the state of Israel—not the policies, but the existence [of the Jewish state]."&lt;ref&gt;Serhan, Yasmeen.

On the appointment of [[Steve Bannon]], who is reputed to be anti-semitic, as [[Donald Trump]] 's White House Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor in 2016, several commentators said  Bannon's personal attitudes would not necessarily translate into opposition to Israel.

In 1968, the East German communist paper [[Neues Deutschland]] justified the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] with the headline "In Prague Zionism is in power".&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Wiesenthal]], Justice not Vengeance, Mandarin 1989 page 207&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, William Korey released a work titled ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism''. Korey's central argument is that the [[Soviet Union]] promoted an "official [[Judeophobic]] propaganda campaign" under the guise of anti-Zionism from 1967 to 1986; after this program was shut down by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], a populist and chauvinist group called [[Pamyat]] emerged in the more open climate of [[Glasnost]] to promote an openly antisemitic message.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Korey]], ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism'', Routledge, 1995, pp. ix–x.&lt;/ref&gt; Korey also argues that much official late-period Soviet antisemitism may be traced back to the influence of ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion''. He notes, for instance, that a 1977 Soviet work titled ''International Zionism: History and Politics'' contains the allegation that most major Wall Street financial institutions are "large financial-industrial Jewish monopolies" exercising control over many countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Korey]], ''Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism'', Routledge, 1995, pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Russian antisemitism'' was reviewed by Robert O.

:''For the Israeli political party, see [[Labor Party (Israel)]].''
'''Avoda''', or '''Avodah''' ({{Lang-he-n|עֲבוֹדָה}}), is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word, literally meaning "work, worship, and service".

In a modern context, usually referring to business-type activities, it can also mean [[agricultural]] work and, more traditionally, serving God.

In its original, traditional sense, "avodah" was applied to sacrifices offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The word was also used to describe the epitome of sacrificial rite, the complex and fraught main service of [[Kohen Gadol|The High Priest]] on [[Yom Kippur]] (The Day of Atonement). Today it refers to a liturgical reenactment of the aforementioned ceremony which is recited during the [[Musaf]] [[Amidah]] of Yom Kippur.

==Avodah in Chassidism==

In [[chassidism]]: Avodah generally refers to Divine service (or worship). For example, it's part of the Divine service to serve God with joy.

"eizohi ''Avodah'' shebelev? zu Teffilah."&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli, Ta'anit 2a&lt;/ref&gt; -translated as "What is the service of the heart? That is teffilah, prayer." That is why in chassidism there is a great emphasis on prayer.

==Avodah and Bnei Akiva==

Avodah is one of the two words that underlie the [[ideology]] of the [[Bnei Akiva]] movement. (The other is [[Torah]]).

In this ideological framework, the word was originally utilised in a strictly agricultural context. "Avodah" meant working on a kibbutz.

In more recent years, Bnei Akiva has had to redefine the terminology. Tens of thousands of its members currently live, or plan to live in an urban setting in Israel. Furthermore, it is generally perceived that the "needs" of Israel have developed somewhat since Bnei Akiva was founded. Draining malarial swamps and "turning the desert green" have assumed somewhat lower priorities than in earlier years. To give an example from [[exporting]], Israel is now known for its [[high tech]] industries as much as for its [[Jaffa orange]]s.

The movement has therefore subtly redefined Avodah, to mean work that contributes towards the building up of the land of Israel.

The measure did not pass, with 76.9% voting against changing the Federal constitution to support basic income.&lt;ref name="Vorlage Nr. 601"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/20160605/det601.html |title = Vorlage Nr. 601 – Vorläufige amtliche Endergebnisse |author =  |date =  |work = admin.ch |accessdate = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''basic income''', also called '''basic income guarantee''', '''universal basic income''' ('''UBI'''), '''basic living stipend''' ('''BLS'''), or '''universal demogrant''', is a type of program&lt;ref&gt;Basic income is distinct from [[welfare]] in that it may have no [[means test]], and distinct from the definition of [[Social security]] for the same reason; it is more like an insurance program such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States) Social Security] in the United States, which is [https://books.google.com/books?id=a5R44srUbsUC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22social%20security%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22social%20security%22&amp;f=false defined as a "federal insurance" program]; nevertheless, strictly speaking Basic income does not fit the definition of other types of programs, although it is properly categorized under the general term [[Welfare state]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which citizens (or permanent residents) of a country, or any other region, may receive a regular sum of money from a source such as the government. A pure or unconditional basic income has no [[means test]], but unlike [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security in the United States]] it is distributed automatically to all citizens without a requirement to notify changes in the citizen's financial status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ |title = History of Basic Income |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621140909/http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html |archivedate = 21 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3013634 Universal Basic Income: A Review] Social Science Research Network (SSRN).

An unconditional income that is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (at or above the [[poverty line]]), is called full basic income, while if it is less than that amount, it is called partial'''.'''  

Some welfare systems are related to basic income but have certain conditions. As these are not universal, they are more often referred to as [[guaranteed minimum income]] systems. For example, Bolsa Família in Brazil is restricted to poor families and the children are obligated to attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattei|first1=Lauro|last2=Sánchez-Ancochea|first2=Diego|title=Bolsa Família, poverty and inequality: Political and economic effects in the short and long run|journal=Global Social Policy|date=2011|page=1|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1468018111421297|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A related welfare system is [[negative income tax]], in which the government stipend is gradually reduced with higher labor income.

== History ==
{{See also|Basic income around the world}}
The idea of a state-run basic income dates back to the early 16th century, when Sir [[Thomas More]] argued in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' that every person should receive a guaranteed income,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce Covert, "What Money Can Buy:  The promise of a universal basic income – and its limitations", ''[[The Nation]]'', vol. 307, no. 6 (September 10 / 17, 2018), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the late 18th century when [[Radicals (UK)|English radical]] [[Thomas Spence]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American revolutionary]] [[Thomas Paine]] both declared their support for a welfare system in which all citizens were guaranteed a certain income. In the 19th century and until the 1960s the debate on basic income was limited, but in the 1960s and 1970s the United States and Canada conducted several experiments with negative income taxation, a related welfare system. From the 1980s and onwards the debate in Europe took off more broadly and since then it has expanded to many countries around the world. A few countries have implemented large-scale welfare systems that are related to basic income, such as [[Bolsa Família]] in Brazil. From 2008 and onwards there have also been several experiments with basic income and related systems. Especially in countries with an existing welfare state a part of the funding assumably comes from replacing the current welfare arrangements, or a part of it, such as different grants for unemployed people. Apart from that there are several ideas and proposals regarding the rest of the financing, as well as different ideas about the level and other aspects.

The idea of an unconditional basic income, given to all citizens in a state (or all adult citizens), was first presented near the middle of the 19th century. But long before that there were ideas of a so-called minimum income, the idea of a one-off grant and the idea of a [[social insurance]] (which still is a key feature of all modern welfare states, with insurances for and against unemployment, sickness, parenthood, accidents, old age and so forth).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The minimum income, the idea to eradicate poverty by targeting the poor, is in contradiction with basic income given "to all", but nevertheless share some underlying ideas about the state's or the city's welfare responsibilities towards its citizens. [[Juan Luis Vives|Johannes Ludovicus Vives]] (1492–1540), for example, proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents, "not on grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity". However, to be entitled to poor relief the person’s poverty must not, he argued, be undeserved, but he or she must "deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://basicincome.org/basic-income/history/ History of Basic Income] Basic Income Earth Network&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to develop the idea of a social insurance was [[Marquis de Condorcet]] (1743–1794). After playing a prominent role in the French Revolution, he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. While in prison, he wrote the ''Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progrès de l’esprit humain'' (published posthumously by his widow in 1795), whose last chapter described his vision of a social insurance and how it could reduce inequality, insecurity and poverty. Condorcet mentioned, very briefly, the idea of a benefit to all children old enough to start working by themselves and to start up a family of their own. He is not known to have said or written anything else on this proposal, but his close friend and fellow member of the Convention Thomas Paine (1737–1809) developed the idea much further, a couple of years after Condorcet’s death.

The first social movement for basic income developed around 1920 in the United Kingdom. Its proponents included [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Dennis Milner]] (with his wife Mabel) and [[C. H. Douglas|Clifford H. Douglas]].

* Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society.
* Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple in the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled “Scheme for a State Bonus” (1918). There they argued for the "introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom". They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.
* Clifford H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system called "social credit", a combination of monetary reform and basic income.

In 1944 and 1945, the [[Beveridge Committee]], led by the British economist [[William Beveridge]], developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance and selective grants. Committee member Lady [[Rhys-Williams]] argued for basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model.&lt;ref name=sloman-2015&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/251445/Sloman%202015%20Contemporary%20British%20History.pdf |title=Beveridge's rival: Juliet Rhys-Williams and the campaign for basic income, 1942-55 |first=Peter |last=Sloman |publisher=New College, Oxford |year=2015 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Tony|title=Freedom and Security: an introduction to the basic income debate|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-22313-7|page=42|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, some welfare debates in the United States and Canada included discussions of basic income. Six pilot projects were also conducted with negative income tax. Then US president Richard Nixon once even proposed a negative income tax in a bill to the US Congress—but Congress eventually only approved a guaranteed income for the elderly and the disabled, not for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the late 1970s and the 1980s, basic income was more or less forgotten in the United States, but on the other hand it started to gain some traction in Europe. Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network, was founded in 1986 and started to arrange international conferences every two years. From the 1980s, some people outside party politics and universities took interest. In West Germany, groups of unemployed people took a stance for the reform.&lt;ref name="archiv-grundeinkommen.de"&gt;Ronald Blaschke [http://www.archiv-grundeinkommen.de/blaschke/20100127-The-Basic-Income-debate-in-Germany.pdf The basic income debate in Germany and some basic reflections] (läst 13 December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005–2010 and onwards, basic income again became an active topic in many countries. Basic income is currently discussed from a variety of perspectives—including in the context of ongoing automation and robotisation, often with the argument that these trends mean less paid work in the future, which would create a need for a new welfare model. Several countries are planning for local or regional experiments with basic income or related welfare systems. Experiments in [[India]], [[Finland]], and [[Canada]], for example, have received international media attention. Several countries have used polls to investigate public support for basic income. In 2016, 76.9% of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] voters in a national referendum rejected a basic income proposal.

==Perspectives in the basic income debate==
=== Transparency and administrative efficiency ===
Basic income is potentially a much simpler and more transparent [[welfare|welfare system]] than [[welfare state]]s currently use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Standing|first=Guy|title=How Cash Transfers Promote the Case for Basic Income|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bis.2008.3.1/bis.2008.3.1.1106/bis.2008.3.1.1106.xml?form=|journal=Basic Income Studies|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.2202/1932-0183.1106|issn=1932-0183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of separate welfare programs (including unemployment insurance, child support, pensions, disability, housing support) it could be one income, or it could be a basic payment that welfare programs could add to.&lt;ref&gt;[[G Standing]], ''Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen'' (2017) ch 7. E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN], part 4(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This could require less paperwork and bureaucracy to check eligibility. The lack of means test or similar bureaucracy would allow for saving on [[social welfare]], which could be put towards the grant. The [[Basic Income Earth Network]] (BIEN) claims that basic income costs less than current means-tested social welfare benefits, and has proposed an implementation that it claims to be financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/basic-income/faq/ |title = BIEN: frequently asked questions |last =  |first =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://basicincome.org/research/ |title = Research |last =  |first =  |date =  |website =  |publisher = Basic Income Earth Network |access-date =  |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A real world example of how basic income is being implemented to save money can be seen in the program that is being conducted by the Netherlands in a few cities. The city councillor for the city of Nijmegen, Lisa Westerveld had this to say in an interview -  “In Nijmegen we get £88m to give to people on welfare, but it costs £15m a year for the civil servants running the bureaucracy of the current system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/dutch-city-utrecht-basic-income-uk-greens|title=Dutch city plans to pay citizens a ‘basic income’, and Greens say it could work in the UK|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|date=2015-12-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her view is also shared by Dutch historian and author Rutger Bregman who believes the Netherlands welfare system is flawed and also economist Loek Groot who believes the country welfare system wastes too much money .The outcomes of this program will be analysed by eminent economist Loek Groot, a professor at the University of Utrecht who hopes to learn if a guaranteed income might be a more effective approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/netherlands-utrecht-universal-basic-income-experiment/487883/|title=The Netherlands' Upcoming Experiment With Universal Basic Income|last=Hamilton|first=Tracy Brown|date=2016-06-21|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other proponents argue for adding basic income to existing welfare grants, rather than replacing them.

=== Poverty reduction ===

Advocates of basic income often argue that it has a potential to reduce or even [[poverty reduction|eradicate poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/06/utopian-thinking-poverty-universal-basic-income|title=Utopian thinking: the easy way to eradicate poverty – Rutger Bregman|first=Rutger|last=Bregman|date=6 March 2017|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a randomized controlled study done by the [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] on the Give Directly program that took place in the Rarieda District of Kenya , the impact of the UBI program saw for every $1,000 disbursed a $270 increase in earnings, a $430 increase in assets, $330 increase in nutrition spending with 0% effect on alcohol or tobacco spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly|title=Research at GiveDirectly|website=GiveDirectly|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom ===

[[File:Philippe Van Parijs (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Philippe Van Parijs]]

[[Philippe van Parijs|Philippe Van Parijs]] has argued that basic income at the highest sustainable level is needed to support [[real freedom]], or the freedom to do whatever one "might want to do".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bostonreview.net/archives/BR25.5/vanparijs.html|title=A Basic Income for All|website=bostonreview.net|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this, Van Parijs means that all people should be free to use the resources of the Earth and the "external assets" people make out of them to do whatever they want. Money is like an access ticket to use those resources, and so to make people equally free to do what they want with world assets, the government should give each individual as many such access tickets as possible—that is, the highest sustainable basic income.

Karl Widerquist and others have proposed a theory of freedom in which basic income is needed to protect the power to refuse work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781137274724|title=Independence, Propertylessness, and Basic Income - A Theory of Freedom as the Power to Say No - K. Widerquist - Palgrave Macmillan|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory goes like this:

If some other group of people controls resources necessary to an individual's survival, that individual has no reasonable choice other than to do whatever the resource-controlling group demands. Before the establishment of governments and landlords, individuals had direct access to the resources they needed to survive. But today, resources necessary to the production of food, shelter, and clothing have been privatized in such a way that some have gotten a share and others have not. Therefore, this argument goes, the owners of those resources owe compensation back to non-owners, sufficient at least for them to purchase the resources or goods necessary to sustain their basic needs. This redistribution must be unconditional because people can consider themselves free only if they are not forced to spend all their time doing the bidding of others simply to provide basic necessities to themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012" /&gt; Under this argument, personal, political, and religious freedom are worth little without the power to say no. In this view, basic income provides an economic freedom, which—combined with political freedom, freedom of belief, and personal freedom—establish each individual's status as a free person.

=== Gender equality ===
The Scottish economist [[Ailsa McKay]] has argued that basic income is a way to promote [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="mckay1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKay |first=Ailsa |year=2005 |title= The Future of Social Security Policy: Women, Work and a Citizens Basic Income |url= |location= |publisher= Routledge |page= |isbn= 9781134287185 |author-link=Ailsa McKay }}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted in 2001 that "social policy reform should take account of all gender inequalities and not just those relating to the traditional labor market" and that "the citizens' basic income model can be a tool for promoting gender-neutral social citizenship rights."&lt;ref name="mckay1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKay |first1=Ailsa |author-link1=Ailsa McKay |year=2001 |title= Rethinking Work and Income Maintenance Policy: Promoting Gender Equality Through a Citizens' Basic Income |url= |journal=[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= 97–118 |doi=10.1080/13545700010022721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments from different ideologies ===

* Georgist views: [[Geolibertarian]]s seek to synthesize propertarian libertarianism and a geoist (or [[Georgist]]) philosophy of [[land (economics)|land]] as unowned commons or equally owned by all people, citing the [[classical economics|classical economic]] distinction between unimproved land and private property. The rental value of land is produced by the labors of the community and, as such, rightly belongs to the community at large and not solely to the landholder. A [[land value tax]] (LVT) is levied as an annual fee for exclusive access to a section of earth, which is collected and redistributed to the community either through [[public good]]s, such as public security or a court system, or in the form of a basic guaranteed income called a [[citizen's dividend]]. Geolibertarians view the LVT as a [[single tax]] to replace all other methods of taxation, which are deemed unjust violations of the [[non-aggression principle]].
* Right-wing views: Support for basic income has been expressed by several people associated with [[right-wing]] political views. While adherents of such views generally favor minimization or abolition of the public provision of [[welfare]] services, some have cited basic income as a viable strategy to reduce the amount of bureaucratic administration that is prevalent in many contemporary welfare systems. Others have contended that it could also act as a form of compensation for [[fiat currency]] inflation.&lt;ref name="perspectives"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2014/01/27/a-universal-basic-income-conservative-progressive-and-libertarian-perspectives-part-3-of-a-series/ |title = A Universal Basic Income: Conservative, Progressive, and Libertarian Perspectives |publisher = [[EconoMonitor]] |date = 27 January 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Dolan, Ed }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-2013-5 |title = There's A Way To Give Everyone In America An Income That Conservatives And Liberals Can Both Love |work = [[Business Insider]] |date = 13 May 2013 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Weisenthal, Joe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conservative"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-arent-reformicons-pushing-a-guaranteed-basic-income/375600/ |title = The Conservative Case for a Guaranteed Basic Income |work = [[The Atlantic]] |date = 6 August 2014 |accessdate = 29 September 2014 |author = Gordon, Noah }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Feminist views: [[Feminist]] views on the basic income are loosely divided into two opposing views. One view supports basic income as a means of guaranteeing minimum financial independence for women, and of recognizing women's [[unpaid work]] in the home. The opposing Feminist view opposes basic income as something that might discourage women from participation in the workforce—reinforcing traditional gender roles of women belonging in the private area and men in the public area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.basicincome.org/bien/pdf/munich2012/katada.pdf | title=Basic Income and Feminism: in terms of "the gender division of labor" | author=Kaori Katada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gcu.ac.uk/wise/media/gcalwebv2/theuniversity/centresprojects/wise/90324WiSE_BriefingSheet.pdf | title=Beyond Care: Expanding the Feminist Debate on Universal Basic Income | publisher=WiSE | date=September 2015 | author=Caitlin McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===

One argument against basic income is that if people have free and unconditional money, they will "get lazy" and not work as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:198164 |title = urn:nbn:se:su:diva-7385: Just Distribution : Rawlsian Liberalism and the Politics of Basic Income |publisher = Diva-portal.org |accessdate = 16 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cangov94"&gt;{{cite web |author = Gilles Séguin |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm#Disposable |title = ''Improving Social Security in Canada – Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper'', Government of Canada, 1994 |publisher = Canadiansocialresearch.net |accessdate = 16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plcdib/imprints/vanparijsinterview.html The Need for Basic Income]: An Interview with [[Philippe Van Parijs]], ''Imprints'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (March 1997). The interview was conducted by Christopher Bertram.&lt;/ref&gt; Less work means less tax revenue, argue critics, and hence less money for the state and cities to fund public projects. The degree of any disincentive to employment because of basic income would likely depend on how generous the basic income was.

Some studies have looked at employment levels during the experiments with basic income and negative income tax, and similar systems. In the negative income tax-experiments in United States in the 1970s, for example, there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for the main earner. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher. Participants in these experiments, however, knew that the experiment was limited in time.&lt;ref name="cangov94" /&gt; 

In the [[Mincome]] experiment in rural Dauphin, Manitoba, also in the 1970s, there were also slight reductions in hours worked during the experiment. However, the only two groups who worked significantly less were new mothers and teenagers working to support their families. New mothers spent this time with their infant children, and working teenagers put significant additional time into their schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Belik |first = Vivian |url = http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/4100 |title = A Town Without Poverty? Canada's only experiment in guaranteed income finally gets reckoning |publisher = Dominionpaper.ca |date = 5 September 2011 |accessdate = 16 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mincome, "The reduction of work effort was modest: about one per cent for men, three per cent for wives, and five per cent for unmarried women."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.irpp.org/po/archive/jan01/hum.pdf A guaranteed annual income: From Mincome to the millennium (PDF)] Derek Hum and Wayne Simpson&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to a recent study done on the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend which is the most large scale universal basic income program in the United States that has been running since 1976 has showed that this belief is not true. The researchers from University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy professor Damon Jones and University of Pennsylvania School of Public Policy and Practice professor Ioana Marinescu have established that even though there is only a very small decrease in work done by recipients due to various reasons like the ones we saw in the Manitoba experiment,however there has been a 17 percent increase in part time jobs.The authors theorized employment remained steady because the extra income that allowed people to buy more also increased demand for service jobs, a finding consistent with the economic data of the time. There was no effect seen when it came to jobs, such as those in manufacturing, that produce exports. Essentially, the authors argue, macro-economic effects of higher spending supported overall employment.To use an illustrative but hypothetical example, someone who uses her dividend to help with car payments can cut back on her hours working as a cashier at a local grocery store. But because more people are spending more, the store will look to replace that worker who started working less. Meanwhile, the distribution of the dividend won't affect the international demand for oil and the jobs connected to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/|title=A universal basic income experiment in Alaska shows employment didn't drop — Quartz|website=qz.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alaska-universal-basic-income-employment-2018-10|title=Critics of universal basic income argue giving people money for nothing discourages working — but a study of Alaska's 36-year-old program suggests that's not the case|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Jones and Marinescu found instead that the larger scale of the program is what allows it to work, and not dissuade people out of the work force.

Another study that contradicted such decline in work incentive was a pilot project implemented in 2008 and 2009 in the Namibian village of [[Omitara]]; the assessment of the project after its conclusion found that economic activity actually increased, particularly through the launch of small businesses, and reinforcement of the local market by increasing households' buying power.&lt;ref name="bignam"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bignam.org/BIG_pilot.html |title = Basic Income Grant Coalition: Pilot Project |publisher = BIG Coalition Namibia |accessdate = 24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the residents of Omitara were described as suffering "dehumanising levels of poverty" before the introduction of the pilot, and as such the project's relevance to potential implementations in developed economies is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Otjivero residents to get bridging allowance as BIG pilot ends |url = http://www.namibian.com.na/news-articles/national/full-story/archive/2009/december/article/otjivero-residents-to-get-bridging-allowance-as-big-pilot-ends/ |accessdate = 28 July 2016 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303041632/http://www.namibian.com.na/news-articles/national/full-story/archive/2009/december/article/otjivero-residents-to-get-bridging-allowance-as-big-pilot-ends/ |archivedate = 3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Meade]] states that a return to [[full employment]] can only be achieved if, among other things, workers offer their services at a low enough price that the required wage for unskilled labor would be too low to generate a socially desirable distribution of income. He therefore concludes that a "citizen's income" is necessary to achieve full employment without suffering stagnant or negative growth in wages.&lt;ref&gt;Meade, James Edward. ''Full Employment Regained?'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-521-55697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is a disincentive to employment because of basic income, the magnitude of such a disincentive may depend on how generous the basic income was. Some campaigners in Switzerland have suggested a level that would be only just liveable, arguing that people would want to supplement it.&lt;ref name="harford"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://timharford.com/2013/11/a-universal-income-is-not-such-a-silly-idea/ |title = Tim Harford — Article —  A universal income is not such a silly idea |author = Wolf Chiappella |work = Tim Harford |accessdate = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Worstall]], a writer, blogger and Senior Fellow of the [[Adam Smith Institute]],&lt;ref name="ASI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/about-us/key-people/fellows/page/2/ |title=Fellows |publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]] |accessdate=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that traditional welfare schemes create a disincentive to work because such schemes typically cause people to lose benefits at around the same rate that their income rises (a form of [[welfare trap]] where the [[marginal tax rate]] is 100 percent). He has asserted that this particular disincentive is not a property shared by basic income since the rate of increase is positive at all incomes.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/07/12/an-unconditional-basic-income-is-the-solution-but-the-important-word-here-is-basic/ |publisher = Forbes |first = Tim |last = Worstall |title = Forbes article |date = 12 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bad behavior ===

There are concerns that some people will spend their basic income on alcohol and other drugs.&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koga, Kenya. "Pennies From Heaven." Economist 409.8859 (2013): 67–68. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies of the impact of direct cash transfer programs provide evidence to the contrary. A 2014 [[World Bank]] review of 30 scientific studies concludes that "concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco consumption are unfounded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

===Reduction of medical costs ===

The [[Canadian Medical Association]] passed a motion in 2015 in clear support of basic income and for basic income trials in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/08/26/basic-income-just-what-the-doctor-ordered.html|title=Opinion - Basic income: just what the doctor ordered|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], a British journalist, has stated that universal basic income would probably reduce the high medical costs associated with diseases of poverty. The stress, diseases like high blood pressure, type II diabetes etc. would according to Mason probably become less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQyr9l22fLE |title = Paul Mason: 'PostCapitalism'&amp;nbsp;– Talks at Google |first =  |last = Talks at Google |date = 3 March 2016 |publisher =  |accessdate = 28 July 2016 |via = YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage slavery and alienation ===

[[Frances Fox Piven]] argues that an income guarantee would benefit all workers by liberating them from the anxiety that results from the "tyranny of [[wage slavery]]" and provide opportunities for people to pursue different occupations and develop untapped potentials for creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Goldin, Debby Smith, Michael Smith (2014). ''Imagine: Living in a Socialist USA.'' [[Harper Perennial]]. {{ISBN|0-06-230557-3}} p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[André Gorz]] saw basic income as a necessary adaptation to the increasing automation of work, yet basic income also enables workers to overcome the [[Social alienation|alienation]] in work and life and to increase the amount of [[leisure time]].&lt;ref&gt;André Gorz, [http://societal.org/docs/55.htm Pour un revenu inconditionnel suffisant], published in Transversales/Science-Culture (n° 3, 3e trimestre 2002) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic growth ===

Some proponents have argued that basic income can increase [[economic growth]] because it would sustain people while they invest in education to get interesting and well-paid jobs.&lt;ref name="Tanner, Michael 2015"&gt;Tanner, Michael. "The Pros and Cons of a Guaranteed National Income." Policy Analysis. CATO institute, 12 May 2015, Web. 2, 7 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheahen, Allan 2012"&gt;Sheahen, Allan. Basic Income Guarantee: Your Right to Economic Security. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. Book. 29 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also a discussion of basic income within the [[degrowth]] movement, which argues against economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2016/08/basic-income-sustainable-consumption-degrowth-movement/|title=Basic Income, sustainable consumption and the 'DeGrowth' movement   {{!}} BIEN|date=2016-08-13|newspaper=BIEN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Automation ===

The debates about basic income and automation are closely linked. For example, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] argues that the increase in automation creates a greater need for basic income. Concerns about automation have prompted many in the high-technology industry to argue for basic income as an implication of their business models.

Many technologists believe that automation (among other things) is creating [[technological unemployment]]. Journalist [[Nathan Schneider]] first highlighted the turn of the "tech elite" to these ideas with an article in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine, which cited [[Marc Andreessen]], [[Sam Altman]], [[Peter Diamandis]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1|title=Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|date=6 January 2015|publisher=Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="obamawhitehouse.archives.gov"&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf whitehouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Schneider |first = Nathan |title = Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income |date = 6 January 2015 |url = https://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1 |publisher = Vice }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies about automation and jobs validate these concerns. The US White House, in a report to the US Congress, estimated that a worker earning less than $20 an hour in 2010 will eventually lose their job to a machine with 83% probability. Even workers earning as much as $40 an hour faced a probability of 31%.&lt;ref name="obamawhitehouse.archives.gov"/&gt; With a rising [[unemployment]] rate, poor communities will become more impoverished worldwide. Proponents of universal basic income argue that it could solve many world problems like high work stress and could create more opportunities and efficient and effective work. This claim is supported by some studies. In a study in Dauphin, Manitoba, only 13% of labor decreased from a much higher expected number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forget |first=Evelyn L. |title=The Town With No Poverty: The Health Effects of a Canadian Guaranteed Annual Income Field Experiment |journal=Canadian Public Policy |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=283–305 |doi=10.3138/cpp.37.3.283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in several Indian villages, basic income in the region raised the education rate of young people by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Abhishek |last=Roy |work=Sevenpillarsinstitute.org |accessdate=16 July 2017 |title=Part 2 of SPI’s Universal Basic Income Series |url=http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/universal-basic-income-empirical-studies/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Yang , an upcoming presidential candidate talks about how automation is negatively affecting real people when it takes over their jobs in his book The War On Normal People, he says that even though automation might make the economy and market more efficient it is not being used positively to help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029200003|title=The war on normal people : the truth about America's disappearing jobs and why universal basic income is our future.|last=(Entrepreneur),|first=Yang, Andrew|isbn=9780316414227|edition=First edition|location=New York|oclc=1029200003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not creating enough new jobs than the number of old jobs it is replacing. An example of this is - In 2004, BlockBuster was making $6 billion with 84,000 employees. Netflix has so far made $9 billion dollars with only 4,500 employees. Other places where automation is rapidly replacing people is self driving cars, nearly 3 million jobs in the US will be replaced in the next 10 years it is not a question of if they will be replaced but how quickly they will be displaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Ella_alderson/these-jobs-are-most-at-stake-to-be-replaced-by-robots-ce4096c2ceb9|title=These Jobs are Most at Stake to be Replaced by Robots|last=Alderson|first=Ella|date=2018-05-13|website=Medium|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one problem most critics of automation don't realise and argue that automation will create new jobs, but automation is so different this time compared to the Industrial Revolution because peoples livelihood is being displaced in an unprecedented scale and when these people lose the option to pursue these kinds of jobs they will have to be retrained and even then they might not be hired and leave the workforce entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029200003|title=The war on normal people : the truth about America's disappearing jobs and why universal basic income is our future.|last=(Entrepreneur),|first=Yang, Andrew|isbn=9780316414227|edition=First edition|location=New York|oclc=1029200003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides technological unemployment, some tech-industry experts worry that automation will destabilize the labor market or increase economic inequality. One example is Chris Hughes, co-founder of both [[Facebook]] and Economic Security Project. Automation has been happening for hundreds of years; it has not permanently reduced the employment rate but has constantly caused employment instability. It displaces workers who spend their lives learning skills that become outmoded and forces them into unskilled labor. [[Paul Vallée]], a Canadian tech-entrepreneur and CEO of [[Pythian Group|Pythian]], argues that automation is at least as likely to increase poverty and reduce social mobility than it is to create ever-increasing unemployment rate. At the 2016 North American Basic Income Guarantee Congress in Winnipeg, Vallée examined slavery as a historical example of a period in which capital (African slaves) could do the same things that human labor (poor whites) could do. He found that slavery did not cause massive unemployment among poor whites, but instead increased economic inequality and lowered social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tZbXto44n1sKTVgrfl8u_p9vrgoS7WXX0O_le39GyyM/edit#slide=id.p4|title=Paul Vallee, Basic Income, for publication|work=Google Docs|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic critique ===

[[Daron Acemoglu]], Professor in economics at MIT, has expressed doubts about basic income with the following statement: "Current US status quo is horrible. A more efficient and generous social safety net is needed. But UBI is expensive and not generous enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/437296/economists-against-ubi |title = Majority of Economists Surveyed Are against the Universal Basic Income |access-date = 28 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Maskin]] has stated that "a minimum income makes sense, but not at the cost of eliminating Social Security and Medicare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_bPBNf8WXrT4jmtf|title=Poll Results {{!}} IGM Forum|website=www.igmchicago.org|access-date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[Simeon Djankov]], professor at the [[London School of Economics]], argues the costs of a generous system are prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Yang , the presidential candidate wants to provide a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen between 18 and 64 years old. He wants to achieve this by introducing a Value Added Tax  he says even conservatives have known that a [[Value-added tax|VAT]] was going to be necessary at some point in the future, and this is a great opportunity for us to rebalance our economy. We’re the only major economy that doesn’t have a VAT right now; it’s going to be increasingly necessary given the progressive automation we’re already experiencing.

===Basic income as a part of a post-capitalistic economic system===

[[File:ErikOlinWright.2013.jpg|thumb|right|Erik Olin Wright, 2013.]]
   
Harry Shutt proposed basic income and other measures to make all or most enterprises collective rather than private. These measures would create a post-capitalist economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Shutt |first = Harry |title = Beyond the Profits System: Possibilities for the Post-Capitalist Era |publisher = Zed Books |date = 15 March 2010 |isbn = 978-1-84813-417-1 |page = 124 |quote = a flat rate payment as of right to all resident citizens over the school leaving age, irrespective of means of employment status...it would in principle replace all existing social-security entitlements with the exception of child benefits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
[[Erik Olin Wright]] characterizes basic income as a project for reforming capitalism into an economic system by empowering labor in relation to capital, granting labor greater bargaining power with employers in labor markets, which can gradually de-commodify labor by decoupling work from income. This would allow for an expansion in scope of the "social economy", by granting citizens greater means to pursue activities (such as the pursuit of art) that do not yield strong financial returns.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Erik Olin. [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/Basic%20Income%20as%20a%20Socialist%20Project.pdf "Basic Income as a Socialist Project,"] paper presented at the annual US-BIG Congress, 4 – 6 March 2005 (University of Wisconsin, March 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
James Meade advocated for a social dividend scheme to be funded by publicly owned [[Means of production|productive assets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mediahell.org/capitalsocial.htm |title = Basic Income |publisher = Media Hell |accessdate = 9 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell argued for a basic income alongside public ownership as a means of shortening the average working day and achieving full employment.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''Roads to Freedom. Socialism, Anarchism and Syndicalism'', London: Unwin Books (1918), pp. 80–81 and 127&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Economists and sociologists have advocated for a form of basic income as a way to distribute economic profits of publicly owned enterprises to benefit the entire population (also referred to as a ''[[social dividend]]''), where the basic income payment represents the return to each citizen on the capital owned by society. These systems would be directly financed from returns on publicly owned assets and are featured as major components of many models of [[market socialism]].&lt;ref name="Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor = 40470892  |title = Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism |last = Marangos |first = John |journal = International Journal of Political Economy |volume = 34 |issue = 3 |year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guy Standing]] has proposed financing a [[social dividend]] from a democratically-accountable [[sovereign wealth fund]] built up primarily from the proceeds of a levy on rentier income derived from ownership or control of assets - physical, financial and intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Standing, Guy. "Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen, London: Penguin (2017){{cite web | url = https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/304706/basic-income/ |accessdate = 1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standing, Guy.

[[Herman Daly]], considered as one of the founders of [[ecologism]], argued primarily for a [[Steady-state economy|zero growth economy]] within the ecological limits of the planet. But to have such a green and [[sustainable economy]], including basic economic welfare and security to all people, he wrote a lot about the need for structural reforms of the capitalistic system, including basic income, monetary reform, [[land value tax]], trade reforms and higher [[eco-taxes]] (taxes on pollution and CO2). For him, basic income was thus part of a larger structural change of the economic system, towards a more green and sustainable system.

==National debates (a few examples) ==

{{Main|Basic income around the world}}

===Germany===

A commission of the [[Bundestag|German parliament]] discussed basic income in 2013 and concluded that it is "unrealizable" because:
* it would cause a significant decrease in the motivation to work among citizens, with unpredictable consequences for the national economy
* it would require a complete restructuring of the taxation, social insurance and pension systems, which will cost a significant amount of money
* the current system of social help in Germany is regarded as more effective because it is more personalized: the amount of help provided depends on the financial situation of the recipient; for some socially vulnerable groups, the basic income could be insufficient
* it would cause a vast increase in immigration
* it would cause a rise in the [[shadow economy]]
* the corresponding rise of taxes would cause more inequality: higher taxes would cause higher prices of everyday products, harming the finances of poor people
* no viable way to finance basic income in Germany was found&lt;ref name="bundestag.de"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2010/31904334_kw45_pa_petitionen/203030 |title = Deutscher Bundestag – Problematische Auswirkungen auf Arbeitsanreize |language = de |publisher = Bundestag.de |date =  |accessdate = 5 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/petitionen/_2008/_12/_10/Petition_1422.abschlussbegruendungpdf.pdf|title=Petitionen: Verwendung von Cookies nicht aktiviert&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

India has been considering [[Basic income in India|basic income in India.]] On January 31, 2017, the Economic Survey of India included a 40-page chapter on UBI that outlined the 3 components of the proposed program: 1) universality, 2) unconditionality, 3) agency. The UBI proposal in India is framed with the intent of providing every citizen "a basic income to cover their needs," which is encompassed by the "universality" component. "Unconditionality" points to the accessibility of all to the basic income, without any means tests. The third component, "agency," refers to the lens through which the Indian government views the poor. According to the Survey, by treating the poor as agents rather than subjects, UBI "liberates citizens from paternalistic and clientelistic relationships with the state."

=== The Alaska Permanent Fund ===
The [[Alaska Permanent Fund|Permanent Fund of Alaska]] in the United States provides a kind of basic income, based on the oil and gas revenues of the state, to (nearly) all state residents. During her [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]], along with [[Bill Clinton|her husband]], considered including a policy similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund called "Alaska for America" as part of their platform after reading [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] book on the subject ''With Liberty and Dividends for All''. Ultimately, the Clintons decided not to, with Hillary stating in her [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]] memoir ''[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]'', "Unfortunately, we couldn't make the numbers work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=Dylan|title=Hillary Clinton almost ran for president on a universal basic income|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/12/16296532/hillary-clinton-universal-basic-income-alaska-for-america-peter-barnes|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in retrospect Clinton also said, "I wonder now whether we should have thrown caution to the wind and embraced 'Alaska for America' as a long-term goal and figured out the details later", considering that former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretaries]] [[James Baker]] and [[Henry Paulson]] have also proposed a similar nationwide policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clinton|first=Hillary|author-link=Hillary Clinton|title=[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|place=New York|date=September 12, 2017|isbn=978-1-50117-556-5|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker et al. 2017"&gt;{{cite report|last1=Baker III|first1=James A.|author-link1=James Baker|last2=Feldstein|first2=Martin S.|author-link2=Martin Feldstein|last3=Halstead|first3=Ted|author-link3=Ted Halstead|last4=Mankiw|first4=N.

=== Experiments ===
There are also several smaller experiments, which have been labeled as "basic income pilots". The best known are:

* Experiments with [[negative income tax]] in United States and Canada in the 1960s and 1970s.
* The province of [[Manitoba, Canada]], experimented with [[Mincome]], a basic guaranteed income in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouversun.com/business/local-business/innovation-series-feature-on-the-gig-economy|title=Innovation series: Does the gig economy mean 'endless possibilities' or the death of jobs?|date=8 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quasi - UBI Programs ===
[[Bolsa Família]] is a big social welfare program in Brazil that provides money to many poor families in the country. The system is related to basic income, but also has some differences in that there are some conditions like asking the recipients to keep their children in school till graduation. Brazilian Senator [[Eduardo Suplicy]] championed a law, ultimately passed in 2004, that declared Bolsa Família to be a first step towards a national basic income. However, the program has not yet been expanded in that direction.

[[Rythu Bandhu scheme]], is a welfare scheme started on 10 May 2018 aimed towards helping farmers that is being implemented by the State of [[Telangana]] in India where each farmland owner gets a fixed amount of money ₹4000 per acre twice a year for [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] and [[Kharif crop|Kharif]] harvests. A budget allocation of ₹12,000 crores($138 billion at the time of conversion) was made in 2018-19 state budget, the scheme offers a financial help of ₹8,000 per year to each farmer (two crops), and there is no cap on money disbursed to number of acres of land owned and it does not discriminate between rich or poor land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/telangana-proposes-rs-5l-insurance-cover-rs-12000-crore-support-scheme-for-farmers/articleshow/63319240.cms|title=Telangana proposes Rs 5L insurance cover, Rs 12,000 crore support scheme for farmers|date=2018-03-15|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] has been monitoring the program and is doing a study which is yet to be published, but preliminary results have already shown promising results in getting farmers the welfare needed to make investments for farming and procuring fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and other inputs, serving the purpose of the scheme. The first phase of the survey concluded that 85 % of farmers received check's for amounts ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹20,000 for farm land comprising less than an acre to about five acres and about 10% of farmers received check's for amounts above ₹20,000 to ₹50,000 and only 1% of farmers got amounts more than ₹50,000. The spending pattern revealed that a large chunk, 28.5 % of farmers opted to buy seed, about 18% spent the money on fertilizer, 15.4% on new agricultural assets, including farm equipment , 8.6% on pesticides and some used it to engage farm labor and only 4.4 % of beneficiaries said they utilized it for household consumption and a minuscule percentage for repayment of loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ryots-spent-rythu-bandhu-amount-judiciously-survey/article24235239.ece|title=Ryots spent Rythu Bandhu amount judiciously: survey|last=Maitreyi|first=M. l Melly|date=2018-06-23|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scheme received a high satisfaction rate of 92% from farmers since other forms of capital investment like welfare or loans had many strings attached to it and would not reach the farmers before the cropping season starts, many other states and countries are following the development of the program to see if they can implement it for their farmers. Since farmers worldwide are facing many difficulties and in a lot of countries it has become unprofitable, governments are either proving subsidies, welfare or loans but this a new type of program that is considered as an embryonic UBI or QUBI (Quasi) to replace traditional systems of agricultural support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/quasi-ubi-rythu-bandhu-can-be-the-social-agri-policy-template/1239581/|title=Quasi-UBI: Rythu Bandhu can be the social &amp; agri policy&amp;nbsp;template|date=2018-07-11|work=The Financial Express|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nimses]] is a concept that offers universal basic income to every member of its system.&lt;ref&gt;https://futurism.com/what-will-the-currency-of-a-workless-cashless-future-be/&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of Nimses consists of [[time-based currency]] called Nim. 1 nim = 1 minute of life. Every person in Nimses receives nims that can be spent on different goods and services. This concept was initially adopted in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/ukrainian-tech-startup-turns-online-time-digital-cash.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behaviouralism''' (or '''behavioralism''') is an approach in [[political science]] that emerged in the 1930s in the United States. It represented a sharp break from previous approaches in emphasizing an objective, quantified approach to explain and predict political behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 58 says, "Behaviouralism emphasized the systematic understanding of all identifiable manifestations of political behaviour. But it also meant the application of rigorous scientific and statistical methods to standardize testing and to attempt value free inquiry of the world of politics... For the behaviouralist, the role of political science is primarily to gather and analyze facts as rigorously and objectively as possible."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petro, p. 6 says, "Behavioralists generally felt that politics should be studied much in the same way hard sciences are studied."&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences|behavioural sciences]], modeled after the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy p. 58 says, "The term behaviouralism was recognized as part of a larger scientific movement occurring simultaneously in ''all'' of the social sciences, now referred to as the behavioural sciences."&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviouralism claims it can explain political behaviour from an unbiased, neutral point of view.

Behaviouralism seeks to examine the behaviour, actions, and acts of individuals – rather than the characteristics of institutions such as legislatures, executives, and judiciaries  – and groups in different social settings and explain this behavior as it relates to the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
From 1942 through the 1970s, behaviouralism gained support. It was David Easton who started it in the study of political systems.  It was the site of discussion between traditionalist and new emerging approaches to political science.&lt;ref&gt;Eulau, pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of behaviouralism is often attributed to the work of [[University of Chicago]] professor [[Charles Merriam]] who in the 1920s and 1930s, emphasized the importance of examining political behaviour of individuals and groups rather than only considering how they abide by legal or formal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a political approach ==
Prior to the "behaviouralist revolution", political science being a science at all was disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, p. 763&lt;/ref&gt; Critics saw the study of politics as being primarily qualitative and normative, and claimed that it lacked a scientific method necessary to be deemed a science.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, p. 57 says, "On the basis of the philosophical approach, traditionalists prescribe normative solutions to political problems. In their view, no political inquiry into social problems can remain neutral or completely free of normative judgements or prescriptions."&lt;/ref&gt;
Behaviouralists used strict methodology and empirical research to validate their study as a [[social science]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy p 58&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviouralist approach was innovative because it changed the attitude of the purpose of inquiry. It moved toward research that was supported by verifiable facts.&lt;ref&gt;Kegley, p 48&lt;/ref&gt; During its rise in popularity in the 1960s and '70s, behaviouralism challenged the realist and liberal approaches, which the behaviouralists called "traditionalism", and other studies of political behaviour that was not based on fact.

To understand political behaviour, behaviouralism uses the following methods: sampling, interviewing, scoring and scaling and statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Petro, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviouralism studies how individuals behave in group positions realistically rather than how they should behave. For example, a study of the [[United States Congress]] might include a consideration of how members of Congress behave in their positions. The subject of interest is how Congress becomes an 'arena of actions' and the surrounding formal and informal spheres of power.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the term ==
[[David Easton]] was the first to differentiate behaviouralism from [[behaviourism]] in the 1950s (behaviourism is the term mostly associated with psychology).&lt;ref&gt;Easton (1953) p 151&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s, behaviourism itself was referred to as a behavioural science and later referred to as behaviourism. However, Easton sought to differentiate between the two disciplines:&lt;ref name="Berndtson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|title=Behavioralism: Origins of the Concept|last=Berndtson|accessdate=2009-04-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514010256/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/tutkimus/julkaisut/verkko/behavior.htm|archivedate=14 May 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behavioralism was not a clearly defined movement for those who were thought to be behavioralists. It was more clearly definable by those who were opposed to it, because they were describing it in terms of the things within the newer trends that they found objectionable. So some would define behavioralism as an attempt to apply the methods of natural sciences to human behavior. Others would define it as an excessive emphasis upon quantification. Others as individualistic reductionism. From the inside, the practitioners were of different minds as what it was that constituted behavioralism. [...] And few of us were in agreement.&lt;ref&gt;David Easton in Baer et al. eds, 1991 p 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this in mind, behaviouralism resisted a single definition. [[Dwight Waldo]] emphasized that behaviouralism itself is unclear, calling it "complicated" and "obscure."&lt;ref&gt;Waldo, p 58&lt;/ref&gt; Easton agreed, stating, "every man puts his own emphasis and thereby becomes his own behaviouralist" and attempts to completely define behaviouralism are fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;Easton (1962) p 9&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, behaviouralism was a political, not a scientific concept. Moreover, since behaviouralism is not a research tradition, but a political movement, definitions of behaviouralism follow what behaviouralists wanted.&lt;ref name="Berndtson" /&gt; Therefore, most introductions to the subject emphasize value-free research. This is evidenced by Easton's eight "intellectual foundation stones" of behaviouralism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.jccc.net/bwright1/Introreview2.htm|title=Introduction to Political Science. Exam 2 Study guide|accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riemer, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Regularities'' - The generalization and explanation of regularities.
# ''Commitment to Verification'' - The ability to verify ones generalizations.
# ''Techniques'' - An experimental attitude toward techniques.
# ''Quantification'' - Express results as numbers where possible or meaningful.
# ''Values'' - Keeping ethical assessment and empirical explanations distinct.
# ''Systemization'' - Considering the importance of theory in research.
# ''Pure Science'' - Deferring to pure science rather than applied science.
# ''Integration'' - Integrating social sciences and value.

Subsequently, much of the behavioralist approach has been challenged by the emergence of [[postpositivism]] in political (particularly international relations) theory.

== Objectivity and value-neutrality ==
According to David Easton, behaviouralism sought to be "analytic, not substantive, general rather than particular, and explanatory rather than ethical."&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 101"&gt;Riemer, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the theory seeks to evaluate political behaviour without "introducing any ethical evaluations."  Rodger Beehler cites this as "their insistence on distinguishing between facts and values."&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"&gt;Beehler p 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The approach has come under fire from both conservatives and radicals for the purported value-neutrality. Conservatives see the distinction between values and facts as a way of undermining the possibility of [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"/&gt;  Neal Riemer believes behaviouralism dismisses "the task of ethical recommendation"&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 101"/&gt; because behaviouralists believe "truth or falsity of values (democracy, equality, and freedom, etc.) cannot be established scientifically and are beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Somit, pp 176–180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Bay]] believed behaviouralism was a pseudopolitical science and that it did not represent "genuine" political research.&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 51"&gt;Riemer, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Bay objected to empirical consideration taking precedence over normative and moral examination of politics.&lt;ref name="Riemer, p. 51"/&gt;

Behaviouralism initially represented a movement away from "[[naive empiricism]]", but as an approach has been criticized for "naive scientism".&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, p 116&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, radical critics believe that the separation of fact from value makes the empirical study of politics impossible.&lt;ref name="Beehler p 91"/&gt;

===Crick's critique===
British scholar [[Bernard Crick]] in ''The American Science of Politics'' (1959), attacked the behavioural approach to politics, which was dominant in the United States, but little known in Britain.  He identified and rejected six basic premises and in each case argued the traditional approach was superior to behaviouralism:
#research can discover uniformities in human behaviour,
#these uniformities could be confirmed by empirical tests and measurements,
#quantitative data was of the highest quality, and should be analyzed statistically,
#political science should be empirical and predictive, downplaying the philosophical and historical dimensions,
#value-free research was the ideal, and
#social scientists should search for a macro theory covering all the social sciences, as opposed to applied issues of practical reform.&lt;ref&gt;"Crick, Bernard," in John Ramsden, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics'' (2002)  p 174&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centralisation''' (British) or '''centralization''' (both British and American) is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular geographical location  group. This moves the important decision-making and planning powers within the center of the organisation.

The term has a variety of meanings in several fields. In [[political science]], centralisation refers to the concentration of a government's power—both geographically and politically—into a [[centralized government]].

==Centralisation in politics==

===History of the centralisation of authority===
''Centralisation of authority'' is defined as the systematic and consistent concentration of authority at a central point or in a person within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, A. (2012). ''What are the advantages and disadvantages of centralization of authority ?.'' [online] Preservearticles.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/201101143291/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-centralisation-of-authority.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was first introduced in the [[Qin Dynasty]] of China. The Qin government was highly bureaucratic and was administered by a hierarchy of officials, all serving the First Emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancientmilitary.com, (2012). ''Ancient China Government.'' [online] Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ancientmilitary.com/ancient-china-government.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Qin Dynasty practised all the things that [[Han Fei]]zi taught, allowing Qin Shi Huang to own and control all his territories, including those conquered from other countries. Zheng and his advisers ended feudalism in China by setting up new laws and regulations under a centralized and bureaucratic government with a rigid centralization of authority. Under this system, both the military and government thrived. This was because talented individuals were more easily identified and picked out to be trained for specialized functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, D., Bickers, R., Carter, J., de Weert, H., Elders, C., Entenmann, R. and Felton, M. (2007). ''World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia. New York: Marshall Cavendish'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation of authority in ancient Chinese government===
* The monarchical power is the supreme power in the empire. The emperor monopolizes all the resources in the country; his personality and abilities decide the prosperity of the country. This autocratic system allows for faster decision-making and avoids complex solutions to problems that arise. One disadvantage is that courtiers, who compete for the emperor's favor, are able to amass power for themselves, leading to internal strife.(Jin and Liu, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Jin, G. and Liu, Q. (1992). ''The Cycle of Growth and Decline - On the Ultrastable Structure of Chinese Society: Chapter 7''. 2nd ed. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The administrative department has highly centralized power. The duties of each bureaucratic occupation are not clearly defined, leading to inefficiencies as functionaries manage the government and effectively rule the country.

===Idea of centralisation of authority===
The acts for the implementation are needed after delegation. Therefore, the authority for taking the decisions can be spread with the help of the delegation of the authority.

The centralisation of authority can be done immediately, if complete concentration is given at the decision-making stage for any position. The centralisation can be done with a position or at a level in an organisation. Ideally, the decision-making power is held by a few individuals.

===Advantages and disadvantages of the centralisation of authority===
Centralisation of authority has several advantages and disadvantages. The benefits include:

# Responsibilities and duties are well defined within the central governing body.
# Decision-making is very direct and clear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Singh, K. (2015). ''What is Centralization and De-Centralization of the Authority? | Total MBA Guide.'' [online] Mbaofficial.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mbaofficial.com/mba-courses/principles-of-management/what-is-centralization-and-de-centralization-of-the-authority/&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The central power maintains a large "encompassing interest" in the welfare of the state it rules since it stands to benefit from any increase in the state's wealth and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993-01-01|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.2307/2938736}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the incentives of state and ruler are aligned.

Disadvantages, on the other hand are as follows:

# Decisions may be misunderstood while being passed on and lower position departments do not have the decision-making power, therefore it requires an efficient and well-organized top department.
# Attention and support for each department or city may not be balanced.
# Delay of work information may result in inefficiency of the government.
# Discrepancies in the economy and information resources between the centre and other places are significant.&lt;ref&gt;Fujii, G. (2010). ''藤井厳喜WEBサイト | Fujii's Focus For Future 公式ブログ.''

==Centralisation in economy==
===Relationship between centralisation (i.e. concentration of production) and capitalism===
{{Main|Capitalism#Concentration and centralisation|Capital accumulation#Concentration and centralization}}
As written in V.I. Lenin’s book, ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', "The remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lenin, V. (1939). ''Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism.'' New York: International Publishers,  pp.12-54.&lt;/ref&gt; He researched the development of production and decided to develop the concept of production as a centralised framework, from individual and scattered small workshops into large factories, leading the capitalism to the world. This is guided by the idea that once concentration of production develops into a particular level, it will become a monopoly, like party organisations of Cartel, Syndicate, and Trust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Cartel - In economics, a cartel is an agreement between competing firms to control prices or exclude entry of a new competitor in a market. It is a formal organisation of sellers or buyers that agree to fix selling prices, purchase prices, or reduce production using a variety of tactics.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, A. and Sheffrin, S. (2003). ''Economics.'' Needham, Mass.: Prentice Hall, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Syndicate - A syndicate is a self-organising group made up of individuals, companies, corporations or entities formed to transact some specific business, to pursue or promote a shared interest.
*Trust - "A trust is . . . simply the case of one person holding the title of property, whether land or chattels, for the benefit of another, termed a beneficiary. Nothing can be more common or more useful. But the word is now loosely applied to a certain class, of commercial agreements and, by reason of a popular and unreasoning dread of their effect, the term itself has become contaminated."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore, D. (1888). "The Legality of "Trusts". ''Political Science Quarterly'', 3(592).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralisation in business studies==
Most businesses deal with issues relating to the specifics of centralization or decentralization of decision-making. The key question is either whether the authority should manage all the things at the centre of a business (centralised), or whether it should be delegated far away from the centre (decentralised).

The choice between centralised or decentralised varies. Many large businesses necessarily involve some extent of decentralisation and some extent of centralisation when it begins to operate from several places or any new units and markets added.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, J. (2014). ''Centralised versus decentralised structures | Business | tutor2u.'' [online] Beta.tutor2u.net. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://beta.tutor2u.net/business/reference/centralised-versus-decentralised-structures&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation in management===
# Top level managers concentrate and reserve the decision-making power.
# Execution decided by the top level management with the help from the other levels of management.
# Lower levels management do the jobs which directed and controlled by the top managers.'''(BMS Team, 2013)'''&lt;ref&gt;BMS Team, (2013). ''Important Features of centralization | BMS.co.in.''

== Overview ==
[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|According to Tilly, the [[French Revolution]] unfolded from protests against the high taxes the French rulers imposed to balance for the expensive [[American Revolutionary War|American War]].]]
Tilly asks a double question in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', namely: "What accounts for the great variation over time and space in the kinds of states that have prevailed in Europe since AD 990, and why did European states eventually converge on different variants of the national state?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to Tilly's theory, military innovation in pre-modern Europe, especially the use of gunpowder and mass armies, made war considerably more expensive. In order to continue to fund warfare, conquest, and security, only states with sufficient capital and a large population could afford paying for their security and ultimately surviving in a hostile environment. Those in power were forced to develop a means of extraction by, for example, introducing taxation and conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|title = Comparative Perspectives on the State|last = Barkey|first = Karen|date = August 1991|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|first2 = Sunita|last2 = Parikh|issue = 17|pages = 523–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these means of extraction resulted in the creation of state bureaucracies and a centralized state.

The type of state that develops is dependent on the structure of the area. In areas where merchants and capital were the predominant class, city states arose, such as Venice. In areas where independent landlords were the predominant class, centralized absolutism arose, such as Russia. If an area would have both classes more or less equal, a combination of state forms would develop, for example as happened in France and England, according to Tilly. Eventually, all states will develop into the type of state form that Tilly calls the [[nation state]].

With this theory, Tilly questions previous formulations of state development in Europe, arguing that they are unsuccessful in explaining the great variety in kinds of states that have prevailed at different stages of European history since AD 990. He say that they fail "because they locate explanations of state-to-state variation in individual characteristics of states rather than relations among them, and because they assume implicitly a deliberate effect to construct the sorts of substantial, centralized states that come to dominate European life during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Unlike other theories, like the idea of the [[social contract]], Tilly stated that "[w]ar wove the European network of national states, and preparation for war created the internal structures of states within it."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isnblog.ethz.ch/international-relations/charles-tilly-ad-990-1992-twenty-years-on|title=Charles Tilly, AD 990-1992: Twenty Years On|last=Lindberg|first=Marten|date=November 2011|website=The International Relations and Security Work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction between the rulers on the hand and the manipulators of capital on the other, resulted in three state formations, Tilly argues. These state formations are tribute-taking empires, systems of fragmented sovereignty, and national states.

=== From Militarization to Civilianization ===
Tilly notes a "central paradox" in his theory of European state building: "the pursuit of war and military capacity, after having created national states as a sort of by-product, led to a civilianization of government and domestic politics".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Tilly, this transfer of power from armed forces to civilian entities was not so much a tug-of-war but rather happened incrementally. The ''nature'' of power—coercion—did not change, but the individuals that wielded it did. Tilly provides five main reasons for this incremental transition (p.&amp;nbsp;206):
# The building up and maintenance of military forces required massive extractive structures that were run by civilians, eventually forming a counterweight to the same military forces;
# War making forced states to legitimize civilian input since it had to bargain for necessary resources with civilian entities;
# War making dramatically expanded the state and did not downsize its capacities at the end of conflicts;
# Individuals involved in war making were promised dues at the end of the war, and thus legitimately claimed their dues at demobilization;
# Borrowing during conflicts led to bureaucracies being created to service the skyrocketing state debts, which in turn encouraged states to intervene in the local economy.

=== State Building in the Developing World ===
[[Jeffrey Herbst]] is an example of a scholar that builds on Tilly's theory. Herbst explains the relative failure of state building in Africa by the lack of external threats that forced European leaders to concentrate capital and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = War and the State in Africa|jstor = 2538753|journal = International Security|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 117–139|volume = 14|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2538753|first = Jeffrey|last = Herbst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tilly concludes his book, however, emphasizing caution in applying his model to contemporary [[state-building]]. the Tilly argues that the militarization of politics in many developing countries should not be understood as a step towards the development of a stable nation state. He asserts that current conditions of state formation today (at the time of writing, in 1990) are vastly different from what they were in Europe over his study period. First, Tilly notes that the military apparatus in developing countries today is not generally concerned with conquering or defending territory, as opposed to European armies (p.&amp;nbsp;207). Thus, they turn their full capacity to internal control, so that the objective is not to control territory but populations. Second, Tilly writes that the Cold War has led to a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to arm, fund and control developing countries, especially their militaries. Thus, military groups thrived as other organizations withered. Progressively, the military was better able to control the state, whereas civilian organizations could not rival its strength. In other words, Tilly argues that the military groups that run contemporary developing states have little in common with their European counterparts.

He further proposes three hypothesis to start to theorize the lack of civilianization in developing countries (p.&amp;nbsp;220):
# Failure of civilian institutions that lead to military intervention;
# Disproportionate external support for the military;
# No institutional tool to bargain and contain the military since it is artificially funded externally.
Tilly's main claim is thus that the European nation-state as it was constructed is certainly not a ''de facto'' endgame, or ideal polity model. In fact, Tilly argues that it is improbable that current Third World states follow exactly the same processus of state building- and we should not expect them to do so.

=== Academic discussion ===

==== Tarrow, 2008 ====
American sociologist [[Sidney Tarrow]] discussed the book during a 2008 conference organized by the [[Social Science Research Council]] in honor of Charles Tilly. During his talk, he addressed what he saw as four gaps in the book:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''The scope conditions of Tilly's theory'''. War is seen by Tilly as the "prime mover of early modern European state-making, because its requisites led to processes of extraction, protection, production, and distribution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Tarrow wonders how that can explain non-European states and states that formed more recently, such as post-colonial states. There is a lot of literature on "correcting Tilly" on state-building in the [[North–South divide|global South]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x/abstract|title = Tilly Tally: War-Making and State-Making in the Contemporary Third World|last = Taylor|first = Brian D.|date = March 2008|journal = International Studies Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|last2 = Botea|first2 = Roxana|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The theory's internal validity'''. In the 1975 book ''The Formation of National States in Western Europe'', Tilly critiques [[Joseph Strayer]]'s model of state formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State|last = Strayer|first = Joesph R.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1970|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', "the successful cases looked remarkably like Strayer's model."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''There is no attention for the role of religion and capitalism in European state development''', while Tarrow argues "[w]e know how deeply Catholic/Protestant conflicts divided Europe in the [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Year's War]], and how the settlement of that conflict produced the European state system after the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]]." Concerning capitalism, Tarrow said that "not all European states were equally in need of domestic capital to finance their wars", referring to Sweden under King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]. 
# '''The role of rights in state development in the United States''', characterized by the so-called "[[War on Terrorism – Timeline|War on Terror]]". According to Tarrow, Tilly "saw his country at risk of abandoning its devotion to its regime of rights."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Leander, 2012 ====
French/Swedish sociologist [[Anna Leander]] examined Tilly's relevance twenty years later in her article ''Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World''. Leander argues that the "war makes states"  no longer holds for four reasons:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/338105247.pdf|title = Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World|last = Leander|first = Anna|date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[State-building]]'''. While rulers' competition for controlling coercion is a crucial element of Tilly's hypothesis, today's rulers "take increasingly minor roles in the organization of coercion".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; State-building is not a product of interstate conflict anymore but rather of diplomacy and high-politics.
# '''Privatization of coercion'''. Another crucial element - the rulers' monopoly on legitimate violence - is disappearing. Europe and North America have seen a growth of 10 per cent per years in private security companies taking over the state prerogatives since the 1970s, a ''[[Peace Research Institute Frankfurt]]'' report shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence|url = http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?id=113632|website = www.isn.ethz.ch|access-date = 2016-01-25|first = ISN|last = Editors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Privatization of capital'''. Just like coercion, controlling capital is a crucial element in Tilly's hypothesis, as wars are expensive. However, national economics is a function of international economics and subject to international norms, rules, and regulations in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# '''Different interest groups'''. Tilly concludes that the civilianization of government evolved through the bargaining between rulers and their citizens. However, "the privatization of coercion and capital and the decentralization of political power has left rulers as brokers between different [...] interest groups rather than ''ruling them'' from a national center".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== 1992 Edition ==
A revised edition of the book was published in 1992 with the title ''Coercion, Capital, and European States AD 990-1992''. For that edition, Tilly made minor revisions throughout the book and added an extra section discussing the rapid changes in Central and Eastern Europe after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15792">{{Governance}}

Governance is a broader concept than government and also includes the roles played by the community sector and the private sector in managing and planning countries, regions and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Phares, Donald (ed) (2004) ''Metropolitan Governance without Metropolitan Government? As''hgate Publishing, Aldershot UK.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Collaborative Governance''' involves the government, community and private sectors communicating with each other and working together to achieve more than any one sector could achieve on its own. Ansell and Gash (2008) have explored the conditions required for effective collaborative governance. They say “The ultimate goal is to develop a contingency approach of collaboration that can highlight conditions under which collaborative governance will be more or less effective as an approach to policy making and public management” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/05/Ansell-and-Gash-Collaborative-Governance-in-Theory-and-Practice.pdf|title = 'Collaborative Governance in Theory and Practice' Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 18(4): 543-571|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Ansell, Chris &amp;|first = Alison Gash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative governance covers both the informal and formal relationships in problem solving and decision-making. Conventional government policy processes can be embedded in wider policy processes by facilitating collaboration between the public, private and community sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Quintin. “A ‘Performative’ Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance” Space and Polity. 16.2. (2012): 215-232. EBSCO. Web. 14 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative Governance requires three things, namely: support; leadership; and a forum. The support identifies the policy problem to be fixed. The leadership gathers the sectors into a forum. Then, the members of the forum collaborate to develop policies, solutions and answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Collaborative Governance?|url=http://www.policyconsensus.org/publicsolutions/ps_2.html|website=NPCC|publisher=Policy Consensus Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different forms of collaborative governance as such as '''Consensus Building''' and a '''Collaborative Network:'''
* '''Consensus Building''' – "A process where stakeholders build consensus on actions to address specific public policy problems; Community visioning is a process where members of a community build consensus on a descriptions of the community’s desired future and on actions to help make goals for the future a reality."&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Quintin. “A ‘Performative’ Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance” Space and Polity. 16.2. (2012): 215-232. EBSCO. Web. 14 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Collaborative network|'''Collaborative Network''']] – “This system is meant to accomplish more alignment among community needs, strategies of service agencies, priority outcomes, and resource allocation. It’s also meant to accomplish building social capital; integration of human service delivery; and interconnected strategies for relationship building, learning processes, and measurement and modeling among the participants.” &lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Quintin. “A ‘Performative’ Social Movement: The Emergence of Collective Contentions within Collaborative Governance” Space and Polity. 16.2. (2012): 215-232. EBSCO. Web. 14 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Over the past two decades new collaborative approaches to governing and managing have developed in a range of fields, including: urban and regional planning; public administration and law; natural resource management; and environmental management. '''Collaborative governance''' has emerged as a response to the failures of government policy implementation and to the high cost and politicization of regulation and as an alternative to [[managerialism]] and adversarial approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, C., &amp; Gash, A. (2008). Collaborative Governance in Theory and Practice. Retrieved October 16, 2015, from [http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/05/Ansell-and-Gash-Collaborative-Governance-in-Theory-and-Practice.pdf http://sites.duke.edu/niou/files/2011/05/Ansell-and-Gash]&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[public administration]] has changed its focus from [[bureaucracy]] to that of collaboration in the context of the [[network society]]. Public administrators have blurred the lines between the people, the private sector and the government. Although bureaucracies still remain, public administrators have begun to recognize that more can potentially be achieved by collaboration and networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morse|first1=Ricardo|last2=Stephens|first2=John|title=Teaching Collaborative Governance: Phases, Competencies, and Case-Based Learning|journal=Journal of Public Affairs Education|date=Summer 2012|volume=18|issue=3|page=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboration and partnerships are nothing new in the political realm, however the wider use of this leadership style has gained momentum in recent years. In part, this is a response to [[neoliberalism]] with its focus on the primacy of the free-market economy and the private sector.

== Definitions  ==
Ansell and Gash (2008) define collaborative governance as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Collaborative Governance in Theory and Practice|last = Ansell, Chris &amp;|first = Alison Gash|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=544|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'A governing arrangement where one or more public agencies directly engage non-state stakeholders in a collective decision-making process that is formal, consensus-oriented, and deliberative and that aims to make or implement public policy or manage public programs or assets'.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;This definition involves six criteria:: (1) the forum is initiated by public agencies; (2) participants in the forum include non-state actors; (3) participants engage in decision making and are not merely ‘‘consulted’’; (4) the forum is formally organized; (5) the forum aims to make decisions by consensus; and (6) the focus of collaboration is on public policy or public management.

Emerson, Nabatchi and Balogh (2012) have developed a less normative and less restrictive definition, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An Integrative Framework for Collaborative Governance|last = Emerson, Kirk, Tina Nabatchi|first = Stephen Balogh|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–29|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The processes and structures of public policy decision making and management that engage people constructively across the boundaries of public agencies, levels of government, and/or the public, private and civic spheres in order to carry out a public purpose that could not otherwise be accomplished.'.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;This framework definition is a broader analytic concept and does not limit collaborative governance to state-initiated arrangements and to engagement between government and non-government sectors. For example, the definition encompasses collaboration between governments at different levels and hybrid partnerships initiated by the private or community sectors.

== Advantages of Collaborative Governance  ==
The intent of collaborative governance is to improve the overall practice and effectiveness of public administration. The advantages of effective collaborative governance are that it enables a better and shared understanding of complex problems involving many stakeholders and allows these stakeholders to work together and agree on solutions. It can help policy makers identify and target problems and deliver action more effectively. Stakeholders that are involved in developing a solution are more inclined to accept directions given or decisions made. It can thus serve as a way to identify policy solutions that have greater traction in the community. Additionally, it can contribute new perspectives on issues and policy solutions and thus offer new ways to implement strategies for change. For public officials who work in administration and management, collaborative governance can serve as a way of genuinely allowing a wider array of ideas and suggestions in the policy process. It may also be used to test ideas and analyze responses before implementation. For those who are not involved in formal government, it allows them to better understand the inner workings of government and carry more influence in the decision making process. For both public and private sectors, a commitment to collaboration is likely to drive organizational change and affect resource reallocation. Other advantages include combining relevant skills and capacities, as well as allowing specialization. Overall, collaborative governance can lead to mutual learning and shared experiences, while also providing direction for institutional capacity building inside and outside agencies and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Collaborative Governance: A New Era of Public Policy in Australia?|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kUlsWMq6VBEC|publisher = ANU E Press|date = 2008-01-01|isbn = 9781921536410|first = John|last = Wanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages of Collaborative Governance ==
The disadvantages of collaborative governance in relation to complex problems are that the process is time consuming, it may not reach agreement on solutions, and the relevant government agencies may not implement the agreed solutions. In a complex structure with many entities working together, individual roles can become unclear and confusing. Some individuals act largely in a personal capacity, while others may act on behalf of agencies or organizations. Powerful stakeholder groups may seek to manipulate the process. Structural issues also affect agendas and outcomes. Open structures with loose leadership and membership allow multiple participants to gain access to a fast expanding agenda. Achieving goals in such a wide agenda becomes more difficult as an increasing number of players struggle to resolve differences and coordinate actions. Furthermore, challenges arise for implementation when representatives are allowed to come and go with no real obligations to other collaborators. Accountability of participating members, unequal or hidden agendas, trust between members, power imbalances, and language and cultural barriers are all issues that can arise in collaborative government regimes. Critics argue that collaborative governance does not provide the institutional stability and consistency required, and therefore deters progress.&lt;ref&gt;Huxham, C., Vangen, S., Huxham, C., &amp; Eden, C. (2000). ''The Challenge of Collaborative Governance.'' Public Management: An International Journal of Research and Theory, 2:3, 337-358&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Ansell and Gash (2008) and Emerson, Nabatchi and Balogh (2012) seeks to understand these issues and challenges and identify the social and process conditions required for effective collaborative governance.

== Social Applications ==
Collaborative governance has been used to address many complex social, environmental and urban planning issues, including: flood crisis management and urban growth management in Australia; community visioning and planning in New Zealand; and public participation in the redesign of the Ground Zero site in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Power of Co: The Smart Leader's Guide to Collaborative Governance|last = Twyfords|first = |publisher = Twyfords, Wollongong, Australia.|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the USA and countries across much of Western Europe, governments have attempted to shift the focus towards various forms of co-production with other agencies and sectors and with citizens themselves in order to increase civic participation.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Janet; Barnes, Marian; Sullivan, Helen and Knops, Andrew (2004). Public participation and collaborative governance. Journal of Social Policy, 33(2), pp. 203–223.&lt;/ref&gt; The classic forms of hierarchical governance and representative democracy are seen as inefficient when it comes to engaging citizens and making them a part of the decision making process. Large projects and initiatives require involvement and communication with not only citizens but partnerships with other government and non-government agencies and, in some instances, international cooperation with foreign governments and organizations. For example, managing the growing number of official and non-official crossings of the US-Mexico border has required input from all levels of US and Mexican governments, multiple government agencies (like U.S Forest Services and U.S. Border Patrol), land management, and other non-federal agencies for social affairs. All of these parties had to communicate and collaborate to address issues of border security and protecting natural resources. As a result, the U.S.Border Patrol and Forest Service successfully enacted the terms of the 2006 memorandum of understanding, creating inter-agency forums, increasing field coordination and joint operations, and constructing fences and other tactical infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluating the Productivity of Collaborative Governance Regimes: A Performance Matrix|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15309576.2015.1031016|journal = Public Performance &amp; Management Review|date = 2015|issn = 1530-9576|pages = 717–747|volume = 38|issue = 4|doi = |first = Kirk|last = Emerson|first2 = Tina|last2 = and Nabatchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governing and managing large and growing metropolitan urban areas, covering numerous local governments and various levels of State and National governments, provides many governance challenges and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Metropolitan Governance without Metropolitan Government?|last = Phares|first = Donald|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, UK.|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott has reviewed metropolitan planning in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia where collaborative governance arrangements, between State and local governments and the regional community, have evolved over a 20-year period leading to positive outputs and outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Collaborative Governance and Metropolitan Planning in South East Queensland - 1990 to 2010: From a voluntary to a Statutory Model|last = Abbott|first = John|publisher = Australian Centre of Excellence for Local Government (ACELG), Sydney|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.acelg.org.au/news/collaborative-governance-and-metropolitan-planning-south-east-queensland-1990-2010-voluntary}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''The positive outputs and outcomes of collaborative governance and metropolitan planning in SEQ have been extensive and broad and extend well beyond statutory regional land use planning.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;These include: three endorsed non-statutory regional plans; two endorsed statutory regional plans; an infrastructure program linked to the State budget; regional sectoral plans for transport, water supply, natural resource management, etc.; new legislation and institutional arrangements for metropolitan governance; and capital works such as the SEQ busway network..

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971''' was the first [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (formerly named the British Commonwealth). It was held in [[Singapore]], between 14 January 1971 and 22 January 1971, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]].

British prime minister [[Edward Heath]] advised [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] not to attend the conference due to a row within the Commonwealth over Britain selling arms to [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=27 December 2013|title=Only the Queen understands the true value of the Commonwealth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10539479/Only-the-Queen-understands-the-true-value-of-the-Commonwealth.html|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the only CHOGM the Queen would miss until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concern as the Queen misses Commonwealth summit in Sri Lanka|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/10041931/Queens-absence-from-Commonwealth-meeting-sign-of-changing-role.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ugandan president [[Milton Obote]] was overthrown by [[Idi Amin]] in [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|a military coup]], whilst he was attending the meeting.

At the meeting the [[Singapore Declaration|Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles]] was agreed setting out the core political values that would form the main part of the Commonwealth's membership criteria.

"Finally, when all capital, all production, all exchange have been brought together in the hands of the nation, private property will disappear of its own accord, money will become superfluous, and production will so expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off whatever of its old economic habits may remain".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/03.htm ''The ABC of Communism''], Nikoli Bukharin, 1920, Section 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/03.htm ''The ABC of Communism''], Nikoli Bukharin, 1920, Section 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Political Science|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-encyclopedia-of-political-science|doi=10.4135/9781608712434|editor=George Thomas Kurian|publisher=CQ Press|date=2011|isbn=9781933116440|chapter=Withering Away of the State|accessdate=January 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include [[Marxism]] and [[anarchism]] ([[anarcho-communism]]), as well as the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, [[capitalism]]; that in this system there are two major social classes; that [[class conflict|conflict between these two classes]] is the root of all problems in society; and that this situation will ultimately be resolved through a [[social revolution]]. 
The two classes are the [[proletariat|working class]]—who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society—and the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]]—a minority who derives profit from employing the working class through private ownership of the [[means of production]].
The revolution will put the working class in power and in turn establish [[social ownership]] of the means of production, which according to this analysis is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.
[[Communism#Criticism|Critics of communism]] can be roughly divided into those concerning themselves with the practical aspects of 20th century [[communist state]]s&lt;ref name="Bruno Bosteels 2014"&gt;Bruno Bosteels, ''The Actuality of Communism'' (Verso Books, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and those concerning themselves with communist principles and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond C. Taras, ''The Road to Disillusion: From Critical Marxism to Post-communism in Eastern Europe (Routledge, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of communism}}

===Early communism===
The term "communism" was first coined and defined in its modern definition by the [[French people|French]] philosopher and writer [[Victor d'Hupay]]. In his 1777 book ''[[Projet de communauté philosophe]]'', d'Hupay pushes the philosophy of the [[Lumières|Enlightenment]] to principles which he lived up to during most of his life in his [[bastide]] of [[Fuveau]] ([[Provence]]). This book can be seen as the cornerstone of communist philosophy as d'Hupay defines this lifestyle as a "[[commune]]" and advises to "share all economic and material products between inhabitants of the commune, so that all may benefit from everybody's work".&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Cassely, 2016"&gt;Cassely, 2016 : ''Aix insolite et secrète'' JonGlez {{pp.|192–193}} ([http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb45058387v références Bibliothèque nationale de France]).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Pipes]], the idea of a classless, egalitarian society first emerged in [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name="Pipes"&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] ''Communism: A History'' (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-8129-6864-4}}, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th-century [[Mazdak]] movement in [[Iran|Persia (Iran)]] has been described as "communistic" for challenging the enormous privileges of the noble classes and the clergy, for criticizing the institution of [[private property]] and for striving to create an egalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Iran'' Volume 3, {{cite web|url=http://www.derafsh-kaviyani.com/english/mazdak.html|title=The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Period|accessdate=March 30, 2008|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611075040/http://www.derafsh-kaviyani.com/english/mazdak.html|archivedate=June 11, 2008|df=}}, edited by [[Ehsan Yarshater]], Parts 1 and 2, p. 1019, [[Cambridge University Press]] (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communism: The Great Misunderstanding|last=Ermak|first=Gennady|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-1533082893|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time or another, various small communist communities existed, generally under the inspiration of [[Scripture]].&lt;ref name="Lansford_pp24–25"&gt;{{harvnb|Lansford|2007|pp=24–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Christian Church|Christian church]] some [[Monasticism|monastic]] communities and [[religious order]]s shared their land and their other property (see [[Religious communism|religious]] and [[Christian communism]]).

Communist thought has also been traced back to the works of the 16th-century English writer [[Thomas More]]. In his treatise ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), More portrayed a society based on [[common ownership]] of property, whose rulers administered it through the application of reason. In the 17th century, communist thought surfaced again in England, where a [[Puritan]] [[Religious denomination|religious group]] known as the "[[Diggers]]" advocated the abolition of private ownership of land.&lt;ref name="diggers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm|title=Diggers' Manifesto|accessdate=July 19, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60XT6NLIO?url=http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm|archivedate=July 29, 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1895 ''Cromwell and Communism'',{{sfn|Bernstein|1895}} [[Eduard Bernstein]] argued that several groups during the [[English Civil War]] (especially the Diggers) espoused clear communistic, agrarian ideals and that [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s attitude towards these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile.{{sfn|Bernstein|1895}} Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century through such thinkers as [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in [[France]]. Later, following the upheaval of the [[French Revolution]] communism emerged as a political doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;"Communism" ''A Dictionary of Sociology''. John Scott and [[Gordon Marshall (sociologist)|Gordon Marshall]]. Oxford University Press 2005. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, various social reformers founded communities based on common ownership. However, unlike many previous communist communities they replaced the religious emphasis with a rational and philanthropic basis.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;"Communism". ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among them were [[Robert Owen]], who founded [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in Indiana (1825), as well as [[Charles Fourier]], whose followers organized other settlements in the United States such as [[Brook Farm]] (1841–1847).&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

In its modern form, communism grew out of the socialist movement in 19th-century Europe. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] advanced, socialist critics blamed [[capitalism]] for the misery of the [[proletariat]]—a new class of urban factory workers who labored under often-hazardous conditions. Foremost among these critics were [[Karl Marx]] and his associate [[Friedrich Engels]]. In 1848, Marx and Engels offered a new definition of communism and popularized the term in their famous pamphlet ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

===State communism in the Soviet Union===
{{main|Communist state}}
[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR (1922).svg|thumb|The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] as a part of the [[USSR]] in 1922]]
The [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] in Russia set the conditions for the rise to state power of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[Bolsheviks]], which was the first time any avowedly communist party reached that position. The revolution transferred power to the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]], in which the Bolsheviks had a majority.&lt;ref name="or_soviets_1"&gt;''Russia in the Twentieth Century: The Quest for Stability''. David R. Marples. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="or_soviets_2"&gt;''How the Soviet Union is Governed''. Jerry F. Hough. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="or_soviets_3"&gt;''The Life and Times of Soviet Socialism''. Alex F. Dowlah, John E. Elliott. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The event generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement. Marx predicted that [[socialism]] and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development. However, [[Russia]] was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous, largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers. Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeois rule.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Edelman, "Late Marx and the Russian road: Marx and the 'Peripheries of Capitalism'"—book reviews. ''Monthly Review'', December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The moderate [[Menshevik]]s (minority) opposed Lenin's Bolshevik (majority) plan for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] before capitalism was more fully developed. The Bolsheviks' successful rise to power was based upon the slogans such as "Peace, bread and land" which tapped into the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in the [[World War I|First World War]], the peasants' demand for [[land reform]], and popular support for the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol09|Holmes 2009]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] was established in 1922.

Following Lenin's [[democratic centralism]], the Leninist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis, with active cells of members as the broad base. They were made up only of elite [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to [[party discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]]. "Communism". ''The Oxford Companion to World War II''. Ed. I. C. B. Dear and [[M. R. D. Foot]]. Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Purge]] of 1937–1938 was [[Joseph Stalin]]'s attempt to destroy any possible opposition within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. In the [[Moscow Trials]], many old Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917 or in Lenin's Soviet government afterwards, including [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]], [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]], were accused, pleaded guilty and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Sedov, Lev (1980).

Its leading role in the [[World War II|Second World War]] saw the emergence of the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[superpower]], with strong influence over [[Eastern Europe]] and parts of [[Asia]]. The [[Colonial empire|European]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] empires were shattered and communist parties played a leading role in many independence movements. Marxist–Leninist governments modeled on the Soviet Union took power with Soviet assistance in [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]]. A Marxist–Leninist government was also created under [[Joseph Tito|Marshal Tito]] in [[Yugoslavia]], but Tito's independent policies led to the expulsion of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from the [[Cominform]] which had replaced the [[Comintern]] and [[Titoism]] was branded "[[Deviationism|deviationist]]".

===Dissolution of the Soviet Union===
{{main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
The Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26, 1991. It was a result of the declaration number 142-Н of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{ru icon}} [[:s:ru:Декларация Совета Республик ВС СССР от December 26, 1991 № 142-Н|Declaration № 142-Н]] of the [[Soviet of Nationalities|Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], formally establishing the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a state and subject of international law.&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former [[Soviet republics]] and created the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], although five of the signatories ratified it much later or did not do it at all. On the previous day, Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (the eighth and final [[leader of the Soviet Union]]) resigned, declared his office extinct and handed over its powers – including control of the [[Cheget|Soviet nuclear missile launching codes]] – to [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]]. That evening at 7:32, the [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]] was lowered from the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] for the last time and replaced with the pre-revolutionary [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1225.html|title=Gorbachev, Last Soviet Leader, Resigns; U.S. Recognizes Republics' Independence|work=New York Times|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, from August to December all the individual republics, including Russia itself, had seceded from the union. The week before the union's formal dissolution, eleven republics signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]] formally establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States and declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/world/end-soviet-union-text-declaration-mutual-recognition-equal-basis.html|title=The End of the Soviet Union; Text of Declaration: 'Mutual Recognition' and 'an Equal Basis'|work=The New York Times|date=December 22, 1991|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1225.html|title=Gorbachev, Last Soviet Leader, Resigns; U.S. Recognizes Republics' Independence|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these countries, the land is a universal public monopoly administered by the state, as are natural resources and vital industries and services. The [[public sector]] is the dominant sector in these economies and the state plays a central role in coordinating economic development.

==Marxist communism==
===Marxism===
[[File:Marx et Engels à Shanghai.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A monument dedicated to [[Karl Marx]] (left) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (right) in Shanghai, China]]
[[Marxism]], first developed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in the mid-1800s, has been the foremost ideology of the communist movement. Marxism considers itself to be the embodiment of [[scientific socialism]], and rather than model an "ideal society" based on intellectuals' design, it is a non-idealist attempt at the understanding of society and history through an analysis based in real life. Marxism does not see communism as a "state of affairs" to be established, but rather as the expression of a real movement, with parameters which are derived completely from real life and not based on any intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. The German Ideology. 1845. Part I: Feuerbach. Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook. A. Idealism and Materialism. "Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence".&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Marxism does no blueprinting of a communist society and it only makes an analysis which concludes what will trigger its implementation and discovers its fundamental characteristics based on the derivation of real life conditions.

At the root of Marxism is the [[materialist conception of history]], known as historical materialism for short. It holds that the key characteristic of economic systems through history has been the [[mode of production]] and that the change between modes of production has been triggered by [[class struggle]]. According to this analysis, the Industrial Revolution ushered the world into a new mode of production: [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]]. Before capitalism, certain working classes had ownership of instruments utilized in production, but because machinery was much more efficient this property became worthless and the mass majority of workers could only survive by selling their labor, working through making use of someone else's machinery and therefore making someone else profit. Thus with capitalism the world was divided between two major classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich. Marx &amp; Engels Selected Works, Volume One, pp. 81–97, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1969. "Principles of Communism". No. 4 – "How did the proletariat originate?".&lt;/ref&gt; These classes are directly antagonistic: the bourgeoisie has private ownership of the means of production and earns a profit off [[surplus value]], which is generated by the proletariat, which has no ownership of the means of production and therefore no option but to sell its labor to the bourgeoisie.

Historical materialism goes on and says: the rising bourgeoisie within feudalism, through the furtherance of its own material interests, captured power and abolished, of all relations of private property, only the feudal privileges and with this took out of existence the feudal ruling class. This was another of the keys behind the consolidation of capitalism as the new mode of production, which is the final expression of class and property relations and also has led into a massive expansion of production. It is therefore only in capitalism that private property in itself can be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich. Marx &amp; Engels Selected Works, Volume One, pp. 81–97, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1969. "Principles of Communism". No. 15 – "Was not the abolition of private property possible at an earlier time?".&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the proletariat will capture political power, abolish bourgeois property through the common ownership of the means of production, therefore abolishing the bourgeoisie and ultimately abolishing the proletariat itself and ushering the world into a new mode of production: communism. In between capitalism and communism there is the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], a democratic state where the whole of the public authority is elected and recallable under the basis of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Twiss. ''Trotsky and the Problem of Soviet Bureaucracy''. Brill. pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the defeat of the bourgeois state, but not yet of the capitalist mode of production and at the same time the only element which places into the realm of possibility moving on from this mode of production.

An important concept in Marxism is socialization vs. nationalization. Nationalization is merely state ownership of property, whereas socialization is actual control and management of property by society. Marxism considers socialization its goal and considers nationalization a tactical issue, with state ownership still being in the realm of the capitalist mode of production; in the words of Engels: "[The transformation [...] into State-ownership does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. [...] State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich. [[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]. Chapter 3. "But, the transformation—either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership—does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. In the joint-stock companies and trusts, this is obvious. And the modern State, again, is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine—the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers—proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is, rather, brought to a head. But, brought to a head, it topples over. State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution".&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some Marxist groups and tendencies to label states such as the Soviet Union—based on nationalization—as [[State capitalism|state capitalist]].&lt;ref name="hetsa.org.au"&gt;[http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf "State capitalism" in the Soviet Union], M.C.

===Leninism===
[[File:Lenin-statue-in-Kolkata.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Vladimir Lenin]]'s statue in Kolkata, West Bengal]]
{{quotation|We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society. The teachings about this society are called 'socialism'.&lt;br&gt;–Vladimir Lenin, 1903&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1903/rp/1.htm "To the Rural Poor" (1903)]. ''Collected Works''. vol. 6. p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Leninism]] is the body of political theory, developed by and named after the Russian revolutionary and later Soviet premier [[Vladimir Lenin]] for the democratic organisation of a revolutionary vanguard party and the achievement of a dictatorship of the proletariat, as political prelude to the establishment of socialism. Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories developed from Marxism, as well as Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theory for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the agrarian early-twentieth-century [[Russian Empire]]. In February 1917, for five years Leninism was the Russian application of Marxist economics and political philosophy, effected and realised by the Bolsheviks, the vanguard party who led the fight for the political independence of the working class.

===Marxism–Leninism, Stalinism and Trotskyism===
====Marxism–Leninism and Stalinism====
[[File:JStalin Secretary general CCCP 1942 flipped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Joseph Stalin]], 1942]]
[[Marxism–Leninism]] is a political ideology developed by [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name="made_by_stalin"&gt;Г. Лисичкин (G. Lisichkin), Мифы и реальность, Новый мир (''[[Novy Mir]]''), 1989, № 3, p. 59 {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which according to its proponents is based in [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]]. The term describes the specific political ideology which Stalin implemented in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and in a global scale in the [[Comintern]]. There is no definite agreement between historians of about whether Stalin actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin.&lt;ref name="stalin_follow_marx_lenin"&gt;Александр Бутенко (Aleksandr Butenko), Социализм сегодня: опыт и новая теория// Журнал Альтернативы, №1, 1996, pp. 2–22 {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains aspects which according to some are deviations from Marxism, such as "[[socialism in one country]]".&lt;ref name="sioc1"&gt;''Contemporary Marxism'', issues 4–5. Synthesis Publications, 1981. p. 151. "[S]ocialism in one country, a pragmatic deviation from classical Marxism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sioc2"&gt;North Korea Under Communism: Report of an Envoy to Paradise. Cornell Erik. p. 169. "Socialism in one country, a slogan that aroused protests as not only it implied a major deviation from Marxist internationalism, but was also strictly speaking incompatible with the basic tenets of Marxism".&lt;/ref&gt; Marxism–Leninism was the ideology of the most clearly visible communist movement. As such, it is the most prominent ideology associated with communism.

Marxism–Leninism refers to the socioeconomic system and political ideology implemented by Stalin in the Soviet Union and later copied by other states based on the [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet model]] (central planning, [[one-party state]] and so on), whereas [[Stalinism]] refers to Stalin's style of governance. Marxism–Leninism stayed after [[de-Stalinization]], Stalinism did not. In the last letters before his death, Lenin in fact warned against the danger of Stalin's personality and urged the Soviet government to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communism: The Great Misunderstanding|last=Ermak|first=Gennady|year=2016|isbn=978-1533082893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maoism]] is a form of Marxism–Leninism associated with Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]]. After de-Stalinization, Marxism–Leninism was kept in the Soviet Union, but certain [[Anti-revisionism|anti-revisionist]] tendencies such as [[Hoxhaism]] and Maoism argued that it was deviated from, therefore different policies were applied in Albania and China, which became more distanced from the Soviet Union.

Marxism–Leninism has been criticized by other communist and Marxist tendencies. They argue that Marxist–Leninist states did not establish socialism, but rather [[state capitalism]].&lt;ref name="hetsa.org.au"/&gt; According to Marxism, the dictatorship of the proletariat represents the rule of the majority (democracy) rather than of one party, to the extent that co-founder of Marxism [[Friedrich Engels]] described its "specific form" as the [[republicanism|democratic republic]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of the Draft Social-Democratic Program of 1891''. "Marx &amp; Engels Collected Works", Vol 27, p. 217. "If one thing is certain it is that our party and the working class can only come to power under the form of a democratic republic. This is even the specific form for the dictatorship of the proletariat".&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to Engels state property by itself is private property of capitalist nature&lt;ref&gt;"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific". Friedrich Engels. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm Part III]. Progress Publishers. "But, the transformation—either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership—does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces".&lt;/ref&gt; unless the proletariat has control of political power, in which case it forms public property.&lt;ref&gt;"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific". Friedrich Engels. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm Part III]. Progress Publishers. "The proletariat seizes the public power, and by means of this transforms the socialized means of production, slipping from the hands of the bourgeoisie, into public property. By this act, the proletariat frees the means of production from the character of capital they have thus far borne, and gives their socialized character complete freedom to work itself out".&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the proletariat was actually in control of the Marxist–Leninist states is a matter of debate between Marxism–Leninism and other communist tendencies. To these tendencies, Marxism–Leninism is neither Marxism nor Leninism nor the union of both, but rather an artificial term created to justify Stalin's ideological distortion,&lt;ref name="stalin_distortion"&gt;History for the IB Diploma: Communism in Crisis 1976–89. Allan Todd. p. 16. "The term Marxism–Leninism, invented by Stalin, was not used until after Lenin's death in 1924. It soon came to be used in Stalin's Soviet Union to refer to what he described as 'orthodox Marxism'. This increasingly came to mean what Stalin himself had to say about political and economic issues." [...] "However, many Marxists (even members of the Communist Party itself) believed that Stalin's ideas and practices (such as socialism in one country and the purges) were almost total distortions of what Marx and Lenin had said".&lt;/ref&gt; forced into the CPSU and Comintern. In the Soviet Union, this struggle against Marxism–Leninism was represented by [[Trotskyism]], which describes itself as a Marxist and Leninist tendency.

====Trotskyism====
[[Trotskyism]] is a Marxist and Leninist tendency that was developed by [[Leon Trotsky]], opposed to Marxism–Leninism. It supports the theory of [[permanent revolution]] and [[world revolution]] instead of the [[two stage theory]] and [[socialism in one country]]. It supported [[proletarian internationalism]] and another communist revolution in the Soviet Union, which Trotsky claimed had become a "[[degenerated worker's state]]" under the leadership of Stalin, in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form, rather than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Trotsky and his supporters, struggling against Stalin for power in the Soviet Union, organized into the [[Left Opposition]] and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. While in exile, Trotsky continued his campaign against Stalin, founding in 1938 the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the [[Comintern]] In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico City on Stalin's orders.

Trotsky's politics differed sharply from those of Stalin and Mao, most importantly in declaring the need for an international proletarian revolution (rather than socialism in one country) and support for a true dictatorship of the proletariat based on democratic principles.

===Libertarian Marxism===
[[Libertarian Marxism]] is a broad range of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of [[Marxism]]. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as left communism,&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Wayne.[http://www.utopianmag.com/files/in/1000000034/12___WayneLibMarx.pdf Libertarian Marxism's Relation to Anarchism].

[http://libcom.org/library/trotsky-left-opposition-rise-stalinism-theory-practice-john-eric-marot "Trotsky, the Left Opposition and the Rise of Stalinism: Theory and Practice"]&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxism is also critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/social-democracy-1-aufheben-8 The Retreat of Social Democracy&amp;nbsp;... Re-imposition of Work in Britain and the 'Social Europe']. ''Aufheben''. Issue No. 8. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, ''Libertarian Communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom'', Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hal Draper]]|title=The Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels|url=http://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5333|location=|publisher=The Socialist Register|page=|date=1971|isbn=|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[anarchism]], libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of [[libertarian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. [https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194522/http://www.chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3 "Government In The Future"] Poetry Center of the New York YM-YWHA. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as [[Luxemburgism]], [[council communism]], [[left communism]], ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'', the [[Johnson-Forest tendency]], [[world socialism]], [[Lettrism]]/[[Situationist International|Situationism]] and [[operaismo]]/[[autonomism]] and [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/libertarian-marxist-tendency-map|title=A libertarian Marxist tendency map|publisher=libcom.org|date=|accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchism|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[CLR James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Guérin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].

===Council communism===
{{main|Council communism}}
[[Council communism]] is a movement originating in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]]. Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both left-wing Marxism and [[libertarian socialism]].

The central argument of council communism, in contrast to those of [[social democracy]] and Leninist communism, is that democratic [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the Leninist [[ideology|ideologies]], with their stress on respectively parliaments and [[New institutionalism|institutional]] government (i.e. by applying social reforms on the one hand and [[Vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and participative [[democratic centralism]] on the other).

The core principle of council communism is that the government and the [[economic system|economy]] should be managed by [[workers' councils]] composed of delegates elected at workplaces and [[recall election|recallable]] at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[Planned economy|state-run]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] "[[state socialism]]"/"[[state capitalism]]". They also oppose the idea of a "revolutionary party", since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.

===Left communism===
[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]
[[Left communism]] is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas and practices espoused—particularly following the series of revolutions which brought the [[First World War]] to an end—by [[Bolshevik]]s and by [[Social Democracy|social democrats]]. Left communists assert positions which they regard as more authentically [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Proletariat|proletarian]] than the views of [[Marxism–Leninism]] espoused by the [[Comintern|Communist International]] after its [[1st Congress of the Comintern|first congress]] (March 1919) and during its [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|second congress]] (July–August 1920).&lt;ref&gt;''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils'' (includes texts by [[Herman Gorter|Gorter]], [[Antonie Pannekoek|Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst|Pankhurst]] and [[Otto Rühle|Rühle]]), Red and Black Publishers, St. Petersburg, Florida, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9791813-6-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Left communists represent a range of political movements distinct from Marxist–Leninists (whom they largely view as merely the left-wing of capital), from [[anarcho-communist]]s (some of whom they consider internationalist socialists) as well as from various other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example [[De Leonist]]s, whom they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/book/export/html/761|title=The Legacy of De Leonism, part III: De Leon's misconceptions on class struggle|date=2000–2001|accessdate=|website=Internationalism|publisher=|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Marxist communism==
The dominant forms of communism are based on Marxism, but non-Marxist versions of communism (such as [[Christian communism]] and [[anarcho-communism]]) also exist.

===Anarcho-communism===
[[Anarcho-communism]] (also known as [[libertarian communism]]) is a theory of [[anarchism]] which advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[private property]] and [[capitalism]] in favor of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]],&lt;ref name="Mayne"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&amp;pg=PA131|title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms|author=Alan James Mayne|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=316|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jeiudz5sBV4C&amp;pg=PA14|title=Anarchism for Know-It-Alls|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59986-218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[direct democracy]] and a horizontal network of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fabbri|first=Luigi|title=Anarchism and Communism.

[[File:Kropotkin2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Peter Kropotkin]], main theorist of [[anarcho-communism]]]]
Anarcho-communism differs from Marxism rejecting its view about the need for a state socialism phase before building communism. The main theorist of anarcho-communism, [[Peter Kropotkin]], argued that a revolutionary society should "transform itself immediately into a communist society", that is should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the "more advanced, completed, phase of communism".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wayne_Price__What_is_Anarchist_Communism_.html|title="What is Anarchist Communism?" by Wayne Price|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60XT4wIPV?url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wayne_Price__What_is_Anarchist_Communism_.html|archivedate=July 29, 2011|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, it tries to avoid the reappearance of "class divisions and the need for a state to oversee everything".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

To date in human history, the best-known examples of an anarcho-communist society, established around the ideas as they exist today and that received worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon, are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] and the [[Free Territory]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Through the efforts and influence of the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]] during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] within the [[Spanish Civil War]], starting in 1936 anarcho-communism existed in most of [[Aragon]], parts of the [[Levante, Spain|Levante]] and [[Andalusia]] as well as in the stronghold of [[Anarchist Catalonia]] before being brutally crushed by the combined forces of the [[Francoism|authoritarian regime that won the war]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Communist Party of Spain]] repression (backed by the Soviet Union) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as [[Nestor Makhno]] worked to create and defend—through the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]—anarcho-communism in the [[Free Territory]] of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.

===Christian communism===
{{main|Christian communism}}
[[Christian communism]] is a form of [[religious communism]] based on [[Christianity]]. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] compel Christians to support communism as the ideal social system. Although there is no universal agreement on the exact date when Christian communism was founded, many Christian communists assert that evidence from the [[Bible]] suggests that the first Christians, including the [[Acts of Apostles|Apostles]], established their own small communist society in the years following Jesus' death and resurrection. As such, many advocates of Christian communism argue that it was taught by Jesus and practiced by the Apostles themselves.

Christian communism can be seen as a radical form of [[Christian socialism]]. Christian communists may or may not agree with various aspects of [[Marxism]]. They do not agree with the [[Marxism and religion|atheist and antireligious views held by secular Marxists]], but they do agree with many of the economic and existential aspects of Marxist theory, such as the idea that [[capitalism]] exploits the [[working class]] by extracting [[surplus value]] from the workers in the form of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] and the idea that [[Wage labour|wage labor]] is a tool of human [[Social alienation|alienation]] that promotes arbitrary and unjust [[authority]]. Like Marxism, Christian communism also holds the view that capitalism encourages the negative aspects of humans, supplanting values such as mercy, kindness, justice and compassion in favor of greed, selfishness and blind ambition.

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of communist party rule|Criticisms of Marxism}}
{{see also|Anti-communism}}
[[Criticism of communism (disambiguation)|Criticism of communism]] can be divided into two broad categories: that which concerns itself with the practical aspects of 20th century [[communist state]]s&lt;ref name="Bruno Bosteels 2014"/&gt; and that which concerns itself with communist principles and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond C. Taras, ''The Road to Disillusion: From Critical Marxism to Post-communism in Eastern Europe'' (Routledge, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxism is also subject to general criticisms, criticisms related to [[historical materialism]] that it is a type of [[historical determinism]], the necessary suppression of [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic rights]], issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of [[price signal]]s. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref name=howard&gt;See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''.

A '''conscience vote''' or '''free vote''' is a type of vote in a [[legislature|legislative body]] where legislators are allowed to vote according to their own personal [[conscience]] rather than according to an official line set down by their [[political party]]. It can also be used to indicate [[crossbencher|crossbench]] members of a [[hung parliament]] where [[confidence and supply]] is provided to allow formation of a [[minority government]] but the right to vote on conscience is retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspg.org.au/pdf/Understanding%20conscience%20vote%20decisions.pdf|publisher=Australian Study of Parliament Group|title=Understanding Conscience Vote Decisions: The Case of the ACT|work=Australian Parliamentary Review|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp20|title=Conscience votes during the Howard Government 1996 - 2007|date=2 February 2009|publisher=Australian Parliament House}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Free votes'' are found in Canadian and some British legislative bodies, ''conscience votes'' in Australian and New Zealand legislative bodies.

In many [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], particularly those that follow the [[parliamentary system]] of government, the elected members of a legislature who belong to a political party are usually required by that party to vote in accordance with the [[party line (politics)|party line]] on significant legislation, on pain of censure or expulsion from the party. Sometimes a particular party member known as the [[whip (politics)|whip]] is responsible for maintaining this [[party discipline]].&lt;ref name="ukparl"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Priddy|first1=Sarah|title=Free votes in the House of Commons since 1997|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04793/SN04793.pdf|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=22 April 2017|format=PDF|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of a conscience vote, a party declines to dictate an official party line to follow and members may vote as they please. In countries where party discipline is less important and voting against one's party is more common, conscience votes are generally less important.

In most countries, conscience votes are quite rare and are often about issues which are very contentious, or a matter on which the members of any single party differ in their opinions, thus making it difficult for parties to formulate official policies. Usually, a conscience vote will be about religious, moral or ethical issues rather than about administrative or financial ones. Matters such as the [[prohibition|prohibition of alcohol]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]] law reform and the legality of [[prostitution]] are often subject to conscience votes. 

Sometimes a vote may be free for some parties but not for others. For instance, when the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] [[Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage|proposed a motion to re-open the debate on]] Canada's [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage laws]], his Conservatives and the opposition [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] declared it a free vote for their members, while the [[Bloc Québécois]] and the [[New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] both maintained party discipline to defeat the measure.

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[British House of Commons]] there used to be a conscience vote every few years on the restoration of the [[death penalty]], which had been abolished in 1964 (except for [[treason]], for which it was abolished in 1998 in the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]]). It had always been rejected and this practice has now been abandoned. In Britain, laws concerning [[abortion]] have always been subject to a free vote.

The proposed bans on [[fox hunting|hunting with dogs]] proposed by [[Tony Blair]]'s government were the subject of several free votes in Parliament from 2001.&lt;ref name="ukparl" /&gt; On each occasion the Commons voted for a ban and the [[House of Lords]] rejected it. In 2004 the Government, trying to placate the Lords and other opponents of a ban, proposed only restriction and licensing of hunting but anti-hunting MPs (mostly [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[backbencher]]s) forced through an amendment which would effect a total ban. Seconds after the vote on the amendment, the Government bowed to pressure and agreed to force the ban through the Lords under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. It passed in November 2004.

Other decisions which were taken by a free vote include abandoning the experiment with permanent [[daylight saving time|summer time]] and bringing television cameras into Parliament.

== Global use of the conscience vote==
Conscience votes have been held in [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliaments]] on issues of [[Republicanism in Australia|becoming a republic]], [[Abortion in Australia|abortion]], euthanasia, homosexuality, sex discrimination, prostitution, and bioethical issues like assisted reproduction and stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULawRw/2011/5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Zealand Parliament]], conscience votes differ from party votes in that MPs must physically enter a lobby to vote on a motion rather than a party's [[whip (politics)|whip]] calling out the votes on behalf of its MPs. A personal vote can be requested after a contested voice vote by any MP, but whether a personal or party vote is held is at the discretion of the [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives|Speaker]]. Pieces of legislation which were treated as conscience issues in New Zealand include the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]], [[Prostitution Reform Act 2003]], [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]], [[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013]] and the present [[End of Life Choice Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/the-house/audio/2018670140/when-mps-go-with-their-gut-what-is-a-conscience-vote |title=When MPs go with their gut: what is a conscience vote? |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=13 November 2018 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, parties exercise comparatively little control over the votes of individual legislators who are almost always free to vote as they wish. Accordingly, most legislative votes in the United States can be considered free votes, although in rare circumstances a legislator may be disciplined by his or her party for a renegade vote. Such discipline usually occurs only on votes regarding procedural matters on which party unity is expected as a matter of course, rather than substantive matters. For example, Democrat [[James Traficant]] was stripped of his seniority and committee assignments in 2001 when he voted for a Republican, [[Dennis Hastert]], to be [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]]. Because free votes are the norm in the United States, the terms "free vote" and "conscience vote" are generally unused and unknown there.

{{conscription}}
'''Conscription''', sometimes called '''the draft''', is the compulsory enlistment of people in a [[national service]], most often a [[military service]].&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conscription |title=Conscription |publisher= Merriam-Webster Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–8 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].

Conscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as 'Siviilipalvelus' (alternative civil service) in Finland, [[Zivildienst]] (compulsory community service) in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Many post-Soviet countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces but also for paramilitary organizations which are dedicated to [[police]]-like ''domestic only'' service ([[Internal Troops]]) or ''non-[[combat]]'' [[rescue|rescue duties]] ([[Civil defence|Civil defence troops]]) – none of which is considered alternative to the military conscription.

As of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]] enlisted to meet the demand for troops. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during [[war]]time or times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |title=World War II |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, whereas democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

==History==

===In pre-modern times===

====Ilkum====
Around the reign of [[Hammurabi]] (1791–1750 [[Before Christ|BC]]), the [[Babylonian Empire]] used a system of conscription called ''Ilkum''. Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land ''per se'' but specific land supplied by the state.&lt;ref name=JN242&gt;{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.&lt;ref name=JN243&gt;{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval levies====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}

In medieval [[Scandinavia]] the ''leiðangr'' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]), ''leidang'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''leding'', ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''ledung'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''lichting'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''expeditio'' ([[Latin]]) or sometimes ''leþing'' ([[English language|Old English]]), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.

The bulk of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] army, called the ''[[fyrd]]'', was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the freemen of each county. In the 690s Laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service.&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough ''Laws of the Earliest English Kings'' https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/52
&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern writers claim military service was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a "ridiculous fantasy":&lt;blockquote&gt;The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medieval levy in Poland was known as the ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]''.

====Military slavery====
[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]]]]

The system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghulam]]s'' or ''[[mamluk]]s'') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.

In the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''[[Kapıkulu]]''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[devşirme]]'' (translated "gathering" or "converting"). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kapıkulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa]], were recruited in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1609, the Sultan's ''Kapıkulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeniçeri (Turkish military)|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/janissaries.htm|title=Janissaries – LookLex Encyclopaedia|author=Tore Kjeilen|work=i-cias.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250–1517.

From 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  "the Bloodthirsty" (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]]. He used them to coerce the country into submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern times===
[[File:Branka 1863.JPG|thumb|left|Conscription of Poles to the Russian Army in 1863 (by [[Aleksander Sochaczewski]]).]]
{{see also|Remplacement}}
Modern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the [[French Revolution]], to enable the [[French First Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies. Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: "Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation."  It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called "the nation in arms", which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands. More than 2.6 million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Conscription |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwRJ8b4l?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of [[Frederick the Great]]. The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[levée en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France. The ''Krümpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.&lt;ref&gt;Dierk Walter. ''Preussische Heeresreformen 1807–1870: Militärische Innovation und der Mythos der "Roonschen Reform"''. 2003, in Citino, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russian Empire]], the military service time "owed" by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1834 it was decreased to 20 years. The recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Army/military_service_.htm |title=Military service in Russia Empire |publisher=roots-saknes.lv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072619/http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Army/military_service_.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern, an innovation only made possible by the abolition of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]] in 1861. New military law decreed that all male Russian subjects, when they reached the age of 20, were eligible to serve in the military for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm |title=Conscription and Resistance: The Historical Context archived from the original |date=2008-06-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603141235/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm |archivedate=2008-06-03 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades prior to World War I universal conscription along broadly Prussian lines became the norm for European armies, and those modeled on them. By 1914 the only substantial armies still completely dependent on voluntary enlistment were those of Britain and the United States. Some colonial powers such as France reserved their conscript armies for home service while maintaining professional units for overseas duties.

====World Wars====
[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|Young men registering for conscription during [[World War I]], New York City, June 5, 1917.]]

The range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars.
In the United States, the [[Selective Service System]] drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/163.html |title=Records of the Selective Service System (World War I) }}; see also [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] and [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a widespread [[mobilization]] of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility. Expanded-age conscription was common during the Second World War: in Britain, it was commonly known as "call-up" and extended to age 51. [[Nazi Germany]] termed it ''[[Volkssturm]]'' ("People's Storm") and included children as young as 16 and men as old as 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/volkssturm/index.html |title=The German Volkssturm from Intelligence Bulletin |date = February 1945|publisher=lonesentry.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War, both Britain and the Soviet Union conscripted women. The United States was on the verge of drafting women into the Nurse Corps because it anticipated it would need the extra personnel for its planned invasion of Japan. However, the Japanese surrendered and the idea was abandoned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |work=[[CBC News]] |title=CBC News Indepth: International military |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518040804/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |archivedate=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involuntary servitude===
[[American libertarian]]s oppose conscription and call for the abolition of the [[Selective Service System]], believing that impressment of individuals into the armed forces is "[[involuntary servitude]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dehnbase.org/lpus/library/platform/catm.html|title=Conscription And The Military|work=Libertarian Party|publisher=www.dehnbase.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Paul]], a former presidential nominee of the U.S. [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] has said that conscription "is wrongly associated with [[patriotism]], when it really represents slavery and involuntary servitude."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Representative [[Ron Paul]] [http://antiwar.com/paul/?articleid=5651 Conscription Is Slavery], antiwar.com, January 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] opposed conscription, suggesting that "of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy, the military draft is the worst. It is an abrogation of rights. It negates man's fundamental right—the right to life—and establishes the fundamental principle of statism: that a man's life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/draft.html|title=Draft|work=aynrandlexicon.com|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a number of radicals and anarchists, including [[Emma Goldman]], challenged the new draft law in federal court arguing that it was a direct violation of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]'s prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of ''[[Arver v. United States]]'' on 7 January 1918. The decision said the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] gave [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[declare war]] and to raise and support armies. The Court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:
:"It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel."&lt;ref&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) pp. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
It can be argued that in a [[benefit–cost ratio|cost-to-benefit ratio]], conscription during peace time is not worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, David R. "[http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-2-august-2005 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft]" (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Months or years of service performed by the most fit and capable subtract from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration).

The cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&amp;chapter=195469&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=[[Milton Friedman]] |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of conscription==

===Political and moral motives===
{{Further|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}
[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]

[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, feeling it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals. He based this view on the development of the [[Roman republic]], which came to an end at the same time as the Roman army changed from a conscript to professional force.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Social Contract|Rousseau, J-J. Social Contract.]] Chapter "The Roman Comitia"&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Aristotle]] linked the division of armed service among the populace intimately with the political order of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Politics (Aristotle)/Book 6|Aristotle, Politics, Book 6]] Chapter VII and [[s:Politics (Aristotle)/Book 4|Book 4]] Chapter XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] argued strongly for conscription,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Machiavelli, Marketing and Management|last=Phil Harris, Andrew Lock, Patricia Rees|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=9781134605682|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing the professional armies as the cause of the failure of societal unity in Italy.

Other proponents, such as [[William James]], consider both mandatory military and [[national service]] as ways of instilling maturity in young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/wj/meow.htm |title=The Moral Equivalent of War |author= William James |year=1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents, such as [[Jonathan Alter]] and [[Mickey Kaus]], support a draft in order to reinforce social equality, create social consciousness, break down class divisions and for young adults to immerse themselves in public enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1995/07/30/cop-out-on-class.html |title=Cop Out on Class |first=Jonathan |last=Alter |newspaper=Newsweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/03/12/interview_with_mickey_kaus_104743.html |title=Interview with Mickey Kaus |publisher=realclearpolitics.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/archives/1995/10/01/overcoming-merit |title=Overcoming Merit |first=Virginia |last=Postrel |authorlink=Virginia Postrel }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rangel]] called for the reinstatement of the draft during the Iraq conflict, not because he seriously expected it to be adopted, but to stress how the socioeconomic restratification meant that very few children of upper-class Americans served in the all-volunteer American armed forces.

It is estimated by the British military that in a professional military, a company deployed for active duty in peacekeeping corresponds to three inactive companies at home. Salaries for each are paid from the military budget. In contrast, volunteers from a trained reserve are in their civilian jobs when they are not deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

It was more financially beneficial for less-educated young Portuguese men born in 1967 to participate in conscription, as opposed to participating in the highly competitive job market with men of the same age who continued through to higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Card|first1=David|last2=Cardoso|first2=Ana Rute|title=Can Compulsory Military Service Raise Civilian Wages?

==Drafting of women==
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Karakal Winter Training (1).jpg|thumb|Female Israeli soldiers]]

Traditionally conscription has been limited to the male population of a given body. Women and [[disabled]] men have been exempt from conscription. Many societies have considered, and continue to consider, military service as a [[initiation rite|test of manhood]] and a [[rite of passage]] from boyhood into manhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1981 in the United States, several men filed lawsuit in the case ''[[Rostker v.

==Conscientious objection==
{{Main|Conscientious objection|Antimilitarism|Conscientious objection throughout the world}}
A [[conscientious objector]] is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with [[Armed forces|military service]], or, more often, with any role in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;On July 30, 1993, explicit clarification of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Para. 11: {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/IstandardsI3k.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. Framework for communications. Conscientious Objection|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; See Article 18|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, conscientious objectors have special legal status, which augments their conscription duties. For example, Sweden used to allow (and once again, with the re-introduction of conscription, allows) conscientious objectors to choose a service in the "weapons-free" branch, such as an airport fireman, nurse or telecommunications technician.

The reasons for refusing to serve are varied. Some conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, the members of the historic [[peace churches]], [[pacifism|pacifist]] by doctrine; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], while not strictly pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed forces on the ground that they believe Christians should be neutral in worldly conflicts.

===China===
[[File:Soldier Horse.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Terracotta Army|terracotta]] soldier with his horse, China, 210–209 BC]]
Universal conscription in China dates back to the State of Qin, which eventually became the Qin Empire of 221 BC. Following unification, historical records show that a total of 300,000 conscript soldiers and 500,000 conscript labourers constructed the [[Great Wall of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapage.com/friend/goh/beijing/greatwall/greatwall.html Great Wall&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718184726/http://www.chinapage.com/friend/goh/beijing/greatwall/greatwall.html |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following dynasties, universal conscription was abolished and reintroduced on numerous occasions.

{{as of|2011}},&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eng.mod.gov.cn/publications/2017-03/03/content_4774222.htm|title=Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (2011 Amendment) [Effective]|last=Panyue|first=Huang|date=March 2017|website=Mnistry of National Defense The People's Republic of China|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; universal military conscription is theoretically mandatory in the People's Republic of China, and reinforced by law. However, due to the large population of China and large pool of candidates available for recruitment, the People's Liberation Army has always had sufficient volunteers, so conscription has not been required in practice at all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Europe===

====Austria====
Every male citizen of the Republic of Austria up to the age of 35 can be drafted for a six month long basic military training in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Bundesheer]]. For men refusing to undergo this training, a nine-month lasting [[Zivildienst in Austria|community service]] is mandatory.

====Bulgaria====
Bulgaria had mandatory military service for males above 18 until conscription was ended in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wri-irg.org/en/story/2008/bulgaria-conscription-ended/|title=Bulgaria: conscription ended - War Resisters' International|website=www.wri-irg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a shortfall in the army of some 5500 soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plovdiv24.bg/novini/Bylgaria/Purva-stupka-kum-vrushtaneto-na-kazarmata-769722|title=Първа стъпка към връщането на казармата|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of the current ruling coalition have expressed their support for the return of mandatory military service, most notably [[Krasimir Karakachanov]]. Opposition towards this idea from the main coalition partner, GERB, has seen a compromise, where instead of mandatory military service, Bulgaria could possibly introduce a voluntary military service by 2019 where young citizens can volunteer for a period of 6 to 9 months, and will receive a basic wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnes.bg/politika/2018/01/29/staroto-se-uvolniava-zaicite-revat-i-eto-idva-karakachanova-kazarma.366403|title=Старото се уволнява, зайците реват...

====Cyprus====
{{main|Conscription in Cyprus}}
Military service in the [[Cypriot National Guard]] is mandatory for all male citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as any male non-citizens born of a parent of [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] descent, lasting from the January 1 of the year in which they turn 18 years of age to December 31, of the year in which they turn 50.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.army.gov.cy/en/file/Mz7pGiPfUAqhGYAsl9Rd6A==/&lt;/ref&gt;  All male residents of Cyprus who are of military age (16 and over) are required to obtain an [[exit visa]] from the Ministry of Defense. Currently, military conscription in Cyprus lasts 14 months.

====Denmark====
{{main|Conscription in Denmark}}
[[File:Copenhagen royal guard waiting.jpg|thumb|Conscription duty as [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] in Copenhagen.]]
Conscription is known in Denmark since the [[Viking Age]], where one man out of every 10 had to serve the king. [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] changed the law in 1710 to every 4th man. The men were chosen by the landowner and it was seen as a penalty.

Since 12 February 1849, every physically fit man must do military service.

====Finland====
{{main|Conscription in Finland}}
[[File:Suomalainen sotilasvala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish conscripts swearing their [[oath of office#Military oath|military oath]] at the end of their basic training period.]]

Conscription in Finland is part of a general compulsion for [[national service|national military service]] for all adult males ({{lang-fi|maanpuolustusvelvollisuus}}; {{lang-sv|totalförsvarsplikt}}) defined in the 127§ of the [[Constitution of Finland]].

Conscription can take the form of military or of civilian service. According to [[Finnish Defence Forces]] 2011 data slightly under 80% of Finnish males turned 30 had entered and finished the military service. The number of female volunteers to annually enter armed service had stabilised at approximately 300.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puolustusvoimat.fi/wcm/a2fcbb004bc4f18dabeeef82feb3371d/PV_vuke_2011_ENG.pdf?MOD=AJPERES Annual Report 2011. Page 29] Finnish Defence Forces&lt;/ref&gt; The service period is 165, 255 or 347 days for the rank and file conscripts and 347 days for conscripts trained as [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s or reserve officers. The length of civilian service is always twelve months. Those electing to serve unarmed in duties where unarmed service is possible serve either nine or twelve months, depending on their training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20071446 Siviilipalveluslaki (1446/2007)] (''Civilian service act''), 4§.

Any Finnish male citizen who refuses to perform both military and civilian service faces a penalty of 173 days in prison, minus any served days.

By the Conscription Act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of Åland islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of Åland islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|are permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.

The military service takes place in [[Finnish Defence Forces]] or in the [[Finnish Border Guard]]. All services of the Finnish Defence Forces train conscripts. However, the Border Guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the Border Guard Air Wing. Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in [[Lapinjärvi (municipality)|Lapinjärvi]] or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.

====Germany====
{{main|Conscription in Germany}}
In both [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]], military service was mandatory for all male citizens. With the end of the [[Cold War]], then [[German reunification|reunified Germany]] drastically reduced the size of its [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]]. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then only volunteer professionals serve in the Bundeswehr.

====Greece====
{{update|date=March 2017}}
{{main|Conscription in Greece}}
[[File:Changing of the Guard-Unknown Soldier-Hellenic Army.jpg|thumb|[[Evzones]] of the [[Evzones|Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Greek Parliament]] armed with M1 Garands.]]
Since 1914, [[Greece]] has had a period of mandatory [[military]] service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1–10 days at irregular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224001/http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).

The period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12–36 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are accepted into the Greek army on a voluntary basis, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.

Since 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable was under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030615/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_935936_14/08/2005_153317 abuse] of the deferment process, resulting in two thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.

====Lithuania====

Lithuania abolished its conscription in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/02/24/litauen-aterinfor-allman-varnplikt&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015 the Lithuanian parliament voted to return the conscription and the conscripts started their training in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/08/25/varnplikten-ar-tillbaka-i-litauen-hard-konkurrens-om-platserna&lt;/ref&gt; In practice there is no conscription in Lithuania, since all recruits have been volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/lithuania_publishes_2016_conscription_lists/|title=Lithuania publishes 2016 conscription lists|website=www.baltictimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moldova====
[[Moldova]], which currently has male conscription, has announced plans to abolish the practice. Moldova's Defense Ministry announced that a plan which stipulates the gradual elimination of military conscription will be implemented starting from the autumn of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moldova.org/en/moldova-defense-ministry-conscription-will-gradually-abolished-starting-autumn/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
{{main|Conscription in the Netherlands}}
Conscription, which was called "Service Duty" ({{lang-nl|dienstplicht}}) in the [[Netherlands]], was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces. [[Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.

Later on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.

In the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Until then, the Dutch army has become an all-professional force. However, to this day, every male and female&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/02/02/kaderwet-dienstplicht-wordt-aangepast-voor-vrouwen|title=Kaderwet dienstplicht wordt aangepast voor vrouwen|first=Ministerie van|last=Defensie|work=rijksoverheid.nl|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which they are told that they have been registered but do not have to present themselves for service. The Dutch army allowed its male soldiers to have long hair from the early 1970s until the postponement of conscription in the mid-1990s.

====Norway====
{{main|Conscription in Norway}}
{{As of|2016|March}}, Norway currently employs a weak form of mandatory military service for men and women. In practice recruits are not forced to serve, instead only those who are motivated are selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norway's military conscription becomes gender neutral|url=http://www.dw.com/en/norways-military-conscription-becomes-gender-neutral/a-17995882|accessdate=2015-11-24|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 60,000 Norwegians are available for conscription every year, but only 8,000 to 10,000 are conscripted.&lt;ref name="Norwegian Armed Forces - Conscription Statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forsvaret.no/om-forsvaret/fakta-om-forsvaret/Sider/tall-og-statistikk.aspx |title=NDF official numbers |publisher=NDF |accessdate=2007-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112152739/http://forsvaret.no/om-forsvaret/fakta-om-forsvaret/Sider/tall-og-statistikk.aspx |archivedate=2011-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1985, women have been able to enlist for voluntary service as regular recruits.

====United Kingdom====
{{main|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
The [[United Kingdom]] introduced conscription to full-time military service for the first time in January 1916 (the eighteenth month of [[World War I]]) and abolished it in 1920. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, was exempted from the original 1916 military service legislation, and although further legislation in 1918 gave power for an extension of conscription to Ireland, the power was never put into effect.

Conscription was reintroduced in 1939, in the lead up to [[World War II]], and continued in force until 1963. [[Northern Ireland]] was exempted from conscription legislation throughout the whole period.

In all, eight million men were conscripted during both World Wars, as well as several hundred thousand younger single women.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Broad, ''Conscription in Britain 1939–1964: The Militarization of a Generation'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of conscription in May 1939, before the war began, was partly due to pressure from the French, who emphasized the need for a large British army to oppose the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hucker, "Franco-British Relations and the Question of Conscription in Britain, 1938–1939," ''Contemporary European History'', November 2008, Vol. 17 Issue 4, pp 437–56&lt;/ref&gt; From early 1942 unmarried women age 19–30 were conscripted. Most were sent to the factories, but they could volunteer for the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) and other women's services. None was assigned to combat roles unless she volunteered. By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51. During the Second World War, 1.4 million British men volunteered  for service and 3.2 million were conscripted. Conscripts comprised 50% of the [[Royal Air Force]], 60% of the [[Royal Navy]] and 80% of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy A. Crang, "'Come into the Army, Maud': Women, Military Conscription, and the Markham Inquiry," ''Defence Studies'', November 2008, Vol. 8 Issue 3, pp. 381–95; statistics from pp. 392–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain and its colonies did not develop such pervasive administrative states, and therefore did not opt out for regulatory solutions, such as conscription, as a reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulligan|first1=C.

===Israel===
{{main|Conscription in Israel}}
There is a mandatory service for all men and women who are fit and 18 years old. Men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months with some exempt from mandatory service:
* Muslim and Christian Arabs
* permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights
* Ultra-Orthodox Jews can apply for deferment to study in [[Yeshiva]] and the deferment tends to become an exemption
* Female religious Jews, if they declare they are unable to serve due to religious grounds. Many choose to volunteer in the national service [[Sherut Leumi]].

All of the above can choose to volunteer to the IDF. Relatively large numbers of [[Bedouin]] choose to volunteer.

Male [[Druze]] and [[Circassians|Circassian]] Israeli citizens are liable, by agreement with their community leaders (Female Druze and Circassian are exempt from service).

===United States===
{{Main|Conscription in the United States}}
In the United States, conscription, also called "the draft", ended in 1973, but males aged between 18 and 25 are required to register with the [[Selective Service System]] to enable a reintroduction of conscription if necessary. President [[Gerald Ford]] suspended mandatory draft registration in 1975, but President [[Jimmy Carter]] reinstated that requirement when the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan]] five years later. Selective Service registration is still required of almost all young men, although the draft has not been used since 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gill|first=Linda|title=Military Conscription, Recruiting and the Draft|publisher=About.com US Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been no prosecutions for violations of the draft registration law since 1986.&lt;ref name="National Resistance Committee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasbrouck|first1=Edward|title=Prosecutions of Draft Registration Resisters|url=https://hasbrouck.org/draft/prosecutions.html|website=Resisters.info|publisher=National Resistance Committee|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males between the ages of 17 and 45, and female members of the [[US National Guard]] may be conscripted for federal militia service pursuant to 10 U.S. Code § 246 and the [[Militia Clause]]s of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246|title=10 U.S. Code § 246 - Militia: composition and classes|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmopolitanism''' is the [[ideology]] that all [[human being]]s belong to a single [[community]], based on a shared morality. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a '''cosmopolitan''' or '''cosmopolite'''.

A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive [[morality]], a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. In a cosmopolitan community individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships of mutual respect. As an example, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing [[Belief|beliefs]] (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Anthony Appiah |first1 = Kwame

Various cities and locales, past or present, have been or are identified as "cosmopolitan"; that does not necessarily mean that all or most of their inhabitants consciously embrace the above philosophy.  Rather, locales may be called "cosmopolitan" simply because people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious background live in proximity and interact with each other.

In origin, cosmopolitanism suggests the establishment of a cosmo [[polis]] or ‘[[world state]]’ that would embrace all humanity.  Cosmopolitanism has come to stand for peace and harmony among nations, founded upon understanding, tolerance and interdependence.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the {{lang-grc|κοσμοπολίτης}}, or ''kosmopolitês'', formed from "{{lang|grc|κόσμος}}", ''[[cosmos|kosmos]]'', i.e. "world", "universe", or "cosmos", and {{lang|grc|πολίτης}}, "''politês''", i.e. "citizen" or "[one] of a city". Contemporary usage defines the term as "citizen of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kosmopoli/ths|κοσμοπολίτης|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cosmopolitan|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cosmopolitan&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}} {{cite web|title=cosmopolite|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cosmopolite&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Definitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the Greek etymology of "citizen of the world". However, as Appiah points out, "world" in the original sense meant "cosmos" or "universe", not earth or globe as current use assumes.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'', W.W. Norton, New York, 2006, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; One definition that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality. &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite Article = Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global | url= https://www.academia.edu/7547819/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._4_Political_Philosophies_of_the_Global_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical roots===
[[File:Waterhouse-Diogenes.jpg|thumb|Diogenes]]
Cosmopolitanism can be traced back to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] movement in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|The Lives of Eminent Philosophers]]'', Book VI, passage 63; online text [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=D.+L.+6.2.63&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0257 in Greek] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D2 in English] at the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, the broadest basis of social identity in at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The Stoics, who later took Diogenes' idea and developed it, typically stressed that each human being "dwells [...] in two communities&amp;nbsp;– the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. (1997). Kant and Stoic Cosmopolitanism, in The ''Journal of Political Philosophy'' Volume 5, Nr 1, pp. 1–25&lt;/ref&gt;
A common way to understand [[Stoicism|Stoic]] cosmopolitanism is through [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]]' circle model of identity that states that we should regard ourselves as concentric circles, the first one around the self, next immediate family, extended family, local group, citizens, countrymen, humanity. Within these circles human beings feel a sense of "affinity" or "endearment" towards others, which the Stoics termed [[Oikeiôsis]]. The task of world citizens becomes then to "draw the circles somehow towards the centre, making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers, and so forth".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Modern cosmopolitan thinkers===
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Immanuel Kant]], who argued for a ''ius cosmopoliticum'']]
In his 1795 essay ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] stages a ''ius cosmopoliticum'' (cosmopolitan law/right) as a guiding principle to protect people from war, and morally grounds this cosmopolitan right by the principle of universal hospitality. Kant there claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" (see [[common heritage of humanity]]) would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. 'Toward Perpetual Peace' in Practical Philosophy – Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Gregor MJ (trans.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1999. p329 (8:358).&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical concepts of [[Emmanuel Levinas]], on ethics, and [[Jacques Derrida]], on hospitality, provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes. For Levinas, the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the Other. In Being for the Other, he writes that there is no "universal moral law," only the sense of responsibility (goodness, mercy, charity) that the Other, in a state of vulnerability, calls forth.  The proximity of the Other is an important part of Levinas's concept: the face of the Other is what compels the response.

For Derrida, the foundation of ethics is hospitality, the readiness and the inclination to welcome the Other into one's home. Ethics, he claims, is hospitality. Pure, unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others. Levinas's and Derrida's theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the Other as different but of equal standing. Isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world, therefore, it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions, and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others: what conditions of hospitality to impose, and whether or not we have responded to the call of the Other. Further, both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the Other and others, and what is at stake.

Derrida in an interview with Bennington (1997) summarized "cosmopolitanism",&lt;ref name=Bennington1997&gt;

{{Quote
| text  = There is a tradition of cosmopolitanism, and if we had time we could study this tradition, which comes to us from, on the one hand, Greek thought with the Stoics, who have a concept of the 'citizen of the world'. You also have St. Paul in the Christian tradition, also a certain call for a citizen of the world as, precisely, a brother. St. Paul says that we are all brothers, that is sons of God, so we are not foreigners, we belong to the world as citizens of the world; and it is this tradition that we could follow up until Kant for instance, in whose concept of cosmopolitanism we find the conditions for hospitality. But in the concept of the cosmopolitical in Kant there are a number of conditions: first of all you should, of course, welcome the stranger, the foreigner, to the extent that he is a citizen of another country, that you grant him the right to visit and not to stay, and there are a number of other conditions that I can't summarise here quickly, but this concept of the cosmopolitical which is very novel, very worthy of respect (and I think cosmopolitanism is a very good thing), is a very limited concept. (Derrida cited in Bennington 1997).

A further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the [[Second World War]].  As a reaction to the [[Holocaust]] and the other massacres, the concept of [[crimes against humanity]] became a generally accepted category in international law. This clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Ulrich (2006). The Cosmopolitan Vision, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical cosmopolitans are [[Moral universalism|moral universalists]]: they believe that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, come under the same moral standards. The boundaries between nations, states, cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant. A widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Appiah, Kwame Anthony (2006), Cosmopolitanism. Ethics in a World of Strangers, London: Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today's unique historical moment, an emerging [[planetary phase of civilization]], creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as [[global citizen]]s and possible formation of a [[global citizens movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 GTI Paper Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182551/http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 |date=2008-02-11 }} see ''[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/PDFFINALS/15Movements.pdf Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement]'', paper #15, and ''[[Global politics|Global Politics]] and Institutions'', paper #3&lt;/ref&gt; These emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications; [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space; the emergence of [[global warming]] and other ecological threats to our collective existence; new global institutions such as the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], or [[International Criminal Court]]; the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic [[globalization]]; the emergence of global [[NGO]]s and [[Transnationalism|transnational]] social movements, such as the [[World Social Forum]]; and so on. [[Globalization]], a more common term, typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural, social, political, environmental, demographic, values and knowledge transitions taking place.

===Contemporary cosmopolitan thinkers===
{{Cleanup section|Numbers with no known meaning appear in several places|date=February 2012}}
A number of contemporary theorists propose, directly and indirectly, various ways of becoming or being a cosmopolitan individual.

[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] discusses what he calls "Interbeing" as a way of living one's life in relation to others; "Interbeing" might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism. Nhat Hanh's philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of [[Buddhist]] teachings, which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people, animals, plants, and minerals.&lt;ref name=NhatHanh1996/&gt;{{rp|88}} He further describes what he calls "Mindfulness Training of the Order of Interbeing" as being aware of sufferings created by, but not limited to, the following causes: fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others; indoctrination of narrow-minded beliefs; imposition of views; anger; and miscommunication.&lt;ref name=NhatHanh1996&gt;{{cite book |first=Thich |last=Nhất Hạnh |author-link=Thich Nhat Hanh |editor-last=Kotler |editor-first=Arnold |others=Illustrations by Mayumi Oda |title=Being Peace |orig-year=1987 |location=Berkeley |publisher=Parallax |date=1996 |oclc=36745774 |isbn=978-0-938077-97-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–95}} Understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others' suffering and the root causes of suffering. Therefore, to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering, which then leads to compassion. It is through this process that others can be recognized as people.

Other theorists, philosophers, and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence. In ''[[Scared Sacred]]'', [[Velcrow Ripper]] takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Ripper, Velcrow (director) |title=Scared Sacred |medium=Film |publisher=National Filmboard of Canada |date=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Planet", [[Paul Gilroy]] explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what [[Judith Butler]] calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise.

In ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'', [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] notices something important about how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, "at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion" for valuing others?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |location=New York |publisher=Verso |date=2004 |oclc=803802111 |isbn=978-1-84467-005-5 |page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that "methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment."&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;{{rp|67}} This estrangement entails a "process of exposure to otherness" in order to foster "the irreducible value of diversity within sameness."&lt;ref name="Gilroy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilroy |first=Paul |chapter=The Planet |title=After Empire: Multiculture or Postcolonial Melancholia |location=London |publisher=Routledge |date=2004 |oclc=56454095 |isbn=978-0-415-34307-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Estrangement, therefore, could lead to de-emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness.

For Gilroy, being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social, ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise. In "The Planet", Gilroy describes the cases of [[Tom Hurndall]] and [[Rachel Corrie]];&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} each seems to exemplify what might be considered Gilroy's figure of the cosmopolitan. Both Hurndall and Corrie removed themselves (geographically) from their home cultures, presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories. Hurndall and Corrie were both killed in 2003 (in separate incidents) and their stories might serve as affirmations of familiarity, rather than models of estrangement. Gilroy’s model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples; this might be construed as a failure of Gilroy’s theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar.&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;

[[The Venus Project]], an international, multidisciplinary educational organization created by [[Jacque Fresco]], works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding our interdependence with nature and each other.

Some forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Frantz Fanon]], in ''The Wretched of the Earth'', observes that when nations achieved independence from European colonizers, frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future, and they became "manager[s] for Western enterprise...in practise set[ting] up its country as the brothel of Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fanon |first=Frantz |author-link=Frantz Fanon |date=1963 |chapter=The Pitfalls of National Consciousness |title=The Wretched of the Earth |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |translator-first=Constance |translator-last=Farrington |pages=148–205 |oclc=817260777 |isbn=978-0-8021-5083-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}} When "third world" nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital, ostensibly to improve their national quality of life, often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well-placed individuals and not the nation itself.

Further, Mahmood Mamdani in ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim'' suggests that the imposition of Western cultural norms, democracy and [[Christianity]] to name only two, has historically resulted in nationalist violence;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mamdani |first=Mahmood |title=Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |date=2004 |oclc=53315228 |isbn=978-0-375-42285-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Appiah has implied that democracy is a pre-requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appiah |first=Kwame Anthony |author-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |chapter=Kindness to Strangers |title=Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=W.

Much of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken [[nationalism]] and the framework of the sovereign [[nation-state]] for granted. Now, with the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication, some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation-state has become obsolete and that it  is time to design a better and more efficient alternative. [[Jesús Mosterín]] analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mosterín |first=Jesús |author-link=Jesús Mosterín |date=2008 |title=La cultura de la libertad |location=Madrid |publisher=Espasa-Calpe |isbn=978-84-670-2697-9 |oclc=693823808 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church, or the party. From this point of view, the [[Internet]] provides a much more attractive model than the nation-state. Neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people, ideas, or goods.  Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without sovereign nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mosterín |first=Jesús |author-link=Jesús Mosterín |date=2005 |title=A World without Nation States |journal=Acta Institutionis Philosophiae et Aestheticae |volume=23 |pages=55–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasizes the difference between international institutions, led by representatives of the national governments, and world or universal institutions, with clearly defined aims served by directors selected by their personal qualifications, independently of any national bias or proportion.

Criticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism, [[Charles Blattberg]] has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be "rooted," by which he means based upon a "global patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blattberg |first=Charles |date=5 April 2012 |editor1-last=Kymlicka |editor1-first=Will |editor2-last=Walker |editor2-first=Kathryn |ssrn=2034932 |chapter=We Are All Compatriots |title=Rooted Cosmopolitanism |location=Vancouver |publisher=UBC Press |via=Social Science Research Network |isbn=978-0-7748-2262-6 |oclc=886376838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available. Carol Nicholson compares the [[John Searle]]'s opposition to multiculturalism with [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s celebration of it. She uses [[Richard Rorty]] as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism, but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against Searle and in favor of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nicholson |first=Carol |date=1998 |title=Three Views of Philosophy and Multiculturalism: Searle, Rorty, and Taylor |conference=Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy |url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Educ/EducNich.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a conference on "Philosophy in a Multicultural Context", Rasmus Winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism.  He develops [[Bruno Latour]]'s conception of the philosopher as public diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Winther |first=Rasmus Grønfeldt |date=2012 |title=Free to Universalize or Bound by Culture?

==Political and sociological==

[[Emile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) observed the development of what he called the 'cult of the individual', which is a new religion that replaced the Christianity that was dying out, and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity. This new religion would provide the new foundations of Western society, and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation's constitutions. A society's sacred object would be the individual's human dignity, and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country's way of interpreting human dignity and human rights. Thus, rather than finding solidarity through national culture, or a particular traditional religious doctrine, society would be unified by its adherence to political values, i.e. individual rights and a defence of human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile. "Individualism and Individuals": Originally published as "L'individualisme et les intellectuels," Revue bleue, 4e serie, 10 (1898): 7-13. Translated by Mark Traugott. Article accessed: https://www.scribd.com/document/85771137/Durkheim-Individualism-and-the-Intellectuals&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's cult of the individual has many similarities to [[John Rawls]]' [[political liberalism]], which Rawls developed almost a century after Durkheim.&lt;ref&gt;See Cladis, Mark. 'A Communitarian Defense of Liberalism: Emile Durkheim and Contemporary Social Theory' (Stanford University Press: Stanford, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ulrich Beck]] (May 15, 1944 – January 1, 2015) was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional [[nation-state]] politics.  Nation-state theory sees power relations only among different state actors, and excludes a global economy, or subjugates it to the [[nation-state]] model.  Cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta-power game in which global capital, states and civil society are its players.

It is important to mark a distinction between Beck's cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state. For Beck, imposing a single world order was considered [[hegemony|hegemonic]] at best and [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] at worst.  Rather, political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations:
* "Acknowledging the otherness of those who are culturally different"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of the future"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of nature"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of the object"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of other rationalities"

A number of philosophers, including [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have introduced the concept of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]". For Levinas, the Other is given context in ethics and responsibility; we should think of the Other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves. According to Levinas, our initial interactions with the Other occur before we form a will—the ability to make choices. The Other addresses us and we respond: even the absence of response is a response. We are thus conditioned by the Other's address and begin to form culture and identity. After the formation of the will, we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and, as a result, continue the process of forming identity.&lt;ref name="Levinas"&gt;Emmanuel Levinas. Totality and Infinity. An Essay on Exteriority. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;

During this process, it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with Others. Even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction, we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves. Our dependence on the Other for the continuous formation of language, culture, and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us. Also once we've formed a will, it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence. When we have gained the capacity for recognition, the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the Other in [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Levinas"/&gt;

Cosmopolitanism shares some aspects of [[Moral universalism|universalism]] – namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law. However, the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stojadinović|first1=Mladen|title=UNIVERSALISM REVIVED: NEEDS-BASED COSMOPOLITANISM AS A FOUNDATION OF GLOBAL DEMOCRACY|journal=Facta Universitatis, Series: Philosophy, Sociology, Psychology and History|date=2014|volume=13|pages=78–80|url=http://casopisi.junis.ni.ac.rs/index.php/FUPhilSocPsyHist/article/view/331/333|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development. Human dignity, however, is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable. Under cosmopolitanism, all humans have rights; however, history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

As an example, [[Judith Butler]] discusses a Western discourse of "human" in ''Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence''. Butler works through the idea of "human" and notes that "human" has been "naturalized in its 'Western' mold by the contemporary workings of humanism" (32). Thus, there is the idea that not all "human" lives will be supported in the same way, indeed, that some human lives are worth more protection than others. Others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan, present the world-over with varying identities in different places.&lt;ref name="Barua Circulating"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barua, Maan |year=2013 |title=Circulating Elephants: Unpacking the Geographies of a Cosmopolitan Animal |journal= Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers |volume=0 |issue= |url=https://www.academia.edu/5089770|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is reiterated in [[Sunera Thobani]]'s "Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada," where she discusses a discourse in which [[Muslim people]] fall into a good/bad dichotomy: a "good Muslim" is one who has been Westernized and a "bad Muslim" is one who visibly rejects Western cultural influences. Thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized. Individuals who embrace Western ideals are considered fully "human" and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non-Westernized [[Cultural identity|cultural identities]].

According to those who follow Beck's reasoning, a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states, which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents. States would also utilize the power of [[civil society]] actors such as Non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Other authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today's conception of nation-states. These scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity of [[Global Citizen]] will take hold, diminishing the importance of national identities. The formation of a [[global citizens movement]] would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions, creating the space for global political discourse and decisions, would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level. Nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility (i.e., the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level, such as [[global warming]]) and [[subsidiarity]] (i.e., the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible) would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 GTI Paper Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182551/http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 |date=2008-02-11 }} see ''[[Global politics|Global Politics]] and Institutions'', paper #3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniele Archibugi]] proposes a renewed model for [[Global Citizen|global citizenship]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html   The Global Commonwealth of Citizens: Toward a Cosmopolitan Democracy], Princeton University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; institutional cosmopolitanism. It advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life. A number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible. Cosmopolitan democracy, for example, suggests strengthening the United Nations and other international organizations by creating a World Parliamentary Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], Debating Cosmopolitics, London: Verso, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political rhetoric==
{{Further|Rootless cosmopolitan}}
"Cosmopolitanism" became a rhetorical weapon used by nationalists against "alien" ideas that went counter to orthodoxy.  European Jews were frequently accused of being "rootless cosmopolitans."&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Miller and Scott Ury, "Cosmopolitanism: the end of Jewishness?" ''European Review of History—Revue européenne d'histoire'' 17.3 (2010): 337-359 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13507486.2010.481923 abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] in a 1946 Moscow speech attacked writings in which “the positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Greenfield, "The Ugly History of Stephen Miller’s ‘Cosmopolitan’ Epithet: Surprise, surprise—the insult has its roots in Soviet anti-Semitism."

A '''Dear Colleague letter''' is a letter sent by one member of a [[legislative body]] to all fellow members, usually describing a new bill and asking for cosponsors or seeking to influence the recipients' votes on an issue. They can also be used for administrative matters, such as announcing elevator repairs, or informing colleagues of events connected with congressional business, or to set or modify procedures.

== Description ==

A typical "Dear Colleague letter" is written by staff members and will be approved by a Legislative Director as it represents a significant political communication by the member. Dear Colleague letters are short, typically no longer than 500 words.

== Use ==

The use of such letters dates back to at least to the early 20th century. Electronic Dear Colleague letters are now disseminated via in-house networks in the [[US House]] and [[US Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;“Dear Colleague” Letters: A Brief Overview, R. Eric Peterson, Jan. 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Several agencies of the US government have also made use of "Dear Colleague" letters to disseminate information to the public and issue statements on public policy, including those of the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].&lt;ref name = "dhhs"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/resource/csbg-dear-colleague-state-plan-revisions-second-open-comment-period|title=CSBG Dear Colleague State Plan Revisions: Second Open Comment Period|work=Office of Community Services {{!}} ACF|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "doe"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/byYear.jsp?type=dpcletters&amp;year=2018|title=Federal Student Aid - IFAP: iLibrary - Dear Colleague Letters|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Federal Student Aid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "dot"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/policy-letters/dear-colleague-letter-risk-based-reporting-policy|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Risk-Based Reporting Policy|date=2017-10-20|work=FTA|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[UK government]] agencies such as the [[U.K. Department of Health]], Dear Colleague letters convey general information, policy updates or a request for information or action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Lettersandcirculars/Dearcolleagueletters/index.htm Dear Colleague Letters], UK Dept of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurial leadership is effectively using the skills associated with successful individual entrepreneurs and applying those within the environment of a larger organisation.{{cn|date=July 2017}} This especially means within an organisation where those skills have been lost{{cn|date=July 2017}} and replaced with a [[corporation | "corporate"]] mindset that focuses on [[business process | process]], [[system]]s and risk minimisation rather than on entrepreneurial behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definitions and theories==
Other definitions of entrepreneurial leadership have also emerged:

An entrepreneurial leader will proactively identify opportunities to gain advantage through creativity, innovation and market understanding and then hoion and the customer.&lt;ref name="chrisroebuck.co"&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/media/tv-and-radio-interviews/1299-2/&lt;/ref&gt;j

==Attributes of an entrepreneurial leader==
The [https://www.eship.ox.ac.uk/what-does-it-mean-be-entrepreneurial entrepreneurial] leader will work within a formalised organisational structure, but use the approaches normally expected of an entrepreneur to identify opportunities. Once an opportunity has been identified, they work towards creating a value proposition which will enable a rapid testing of their key assumptions. Next to an effective management of risk (rather than the minimisation of risk often sought within corporate environments), they are required to operate with contextual awareness in order to create a value proposition that delivers value to the customer while taking into account the organisational requirements and strategic aims. The entrepreneurial leader must have the ability to learn fast and within environments of ambiguity and change, while providing clarity and coherence for those around them.&lt;ref name="1000ventures.com"&gt;http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/crosscuttings/leadership_entrepreneurial.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/09/CEO-Entrepreneur-Article-March-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="legacee.com"&gt;http://www.legacee.com/Info/Leadership/LeadershipEntrepreneurial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrepreneurial leader takes responsibility for their actions and those actions must be more proactive than reactive. They think about achieving organisational outcomes in an innovative way and working with a diverse group of people and resources to achieve these goals.&lt;ref name="legacee.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=347&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ACf6aSDfbc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srcaMjhsWtI&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
Perhaps the best known and most widely considered example of an entrepreneurial leader is [[Steve Jobs]],&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/blog/steve-jobs-a-true-transformational-leader/&lt;/ref&gt; but there are many real life examples in the world of business and other industries, such as [[Bill Gates]], [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and [[Richard Branson]].&lt;ref name="1000ventures.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chrisroebuck.co"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://4entrepreneur.net/2007/09/19/11-principles-of-entrepreneurial-leadership/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has been ongoing for centuries. History's greatest philosophical writings from Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' to Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' have explored the question "What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?". Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the "[[trait theory|trait theory of leadership]]".

The concept of entrepreneurial leadership was introduced in 2000 by [[Rita Gunther McGrath|McGrath]] and MacMillan who suggested that in dynamic markets where there is increased uncertainty and competitive pressure a new type of leader is required. They described this as the "entrepreneurial leader". These fast changing markets or situations give those with an "entrepreneurial" approach the ability to exploit opportunities to gain advantage for their organisation faster than others.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, R. G. &amp; MacMillan, I. C. 2000. The entrepreneurial mindset : strategies for continuously creating opportunity in an age of uncertainty. Boston, Mass.: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organisations have sought to develop the concept of entrepreneurial leadership within the business world. A good example is UBS, the global bank, which in the period 2002 to 2006 proactively developed entrepreneurial leadership amongst its top 500 leaders. The success of this was demonstrated by improvements in individual, team and financial performance, the project becoming a key element in the Harvard Business School Case study, "UBS Aligning the Integrated firm". The bank was subsequently awarded the title Best Company for Leaders (Europe) 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inspireimagineinnovate.com/pdf/Top_Companies_2005_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of this project over a multi divisional bank spread globally was complex and took a number of years. This is reviewed in a case study by Chris Roebuck, Visiting Professor of Transformational Leadership at Cass Business School in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231722/http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/10/UBS-Case-study-final-Nov-2011-v2.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roebuck was one of the leaders of the team who implemented entrepreneurial leadership in UBS.

The principles of entrepreneurial leadership can be applied to a number of sectors and to a wide variety of organisations. The success of this approach has confirmed the compatibility of entrepreneurial leadership to the majority of organisations seeking to improve client/customer service and overall performance.

Prof Chris Roebuck notes that in recent examples of applying entrepreneurial leadership to organisations, the link to employee engagement has increasingly become as a key success factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2012/11/In-My-Opinion-NOv-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723135817/http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2012/11/In-My-Opinion-NOv-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also allowed development of the concept of entrepreneurial support functions, such as Entrepreneurial HR and Entrepreneurial IT, to support the customer or client facing parts of organisations.&lt;ref&gt;http://chrisroebuck.co/files/2011/08/Different-Slant-Chris-roebuck-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Entrepreneurial Leadership is not so much a style of leadership as a focus of leadership and employees' efforts on specific actions that either maximise the effectiveness of service delivery currently or seek to improve it in the future.

==&lt;!-- The styles of leadership do not describe styles of Entrepreneurial Leadership. This section should thus be removed. --&gt;Styles of leadership==
Leadership style refers to a leader's behavior. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hariman]], Political Style, U of Chicago Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Participative or democratic style===
The democratic leadership style favors decision-making by the group. Such a leader gives instructions after consulting the group. They can win the cooperation of their group and can motivate them effectively and positively. The decisions of the democratic leader are not unilateral as with the autocrat because they arise from consultation with the group members and participation by them.&lt;ref name=Lewin/&gt;

===Autocratic or authoritarian style===
Under the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.

Leaders do not entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;

[[Image:Fasces.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|A ''fasces'' image, with the axe in the middle of the bundle of rods]]
'''Fasces''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|f|æ|s|iː|z}}, {{IPA-la|ˈfa.skeːs|lang}}; a ''[[plurale tantum]]'', from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:en:fascis#Latin|fascis]]'', meaning "bundle";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=fasces Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]: fasces&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-it|fascio littorio}}) is a bound bundle of wooden rods, sometimes including an axe with its blade emerging. The fasces had its origin in the [[Etruscan civilization]] and was passed on to [[ancient Rome]], where it symbolized a [[magistrate]]'s [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[jurisdiction]]. The axe originally associated with the symbol, the [[Labrys]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|xld-Grek|λάβρυς}}, ''{{lang|xld-Latn|lábrys}}'') the double-[[Axe#Parts of the axe|bitted]] [[axe]], originally from [[Crete]], is one of the oldest symbols of Greek civilization. To the Romans, it was known as a ''bipennis''.&lt;ref&gt;the term for a single-bladed axe being ''hēmipelekys'' "half-pelekys", e.g. [[Iliad|Il]]. 23.883.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, the symbol was associated with [[female deities]], from prehistoric through historic times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The image has survived in the modern world as a representation of magisterial or collective power, law and governance. The fasces frequently occurs as a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]: it is present on the reverse of the U.S. [[Mercury dime]] coin and behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]]; and it was the origin of the name of the [[National Fascist Party]] in Italy (from which the term ''[[fascism]]'' is derived).

During the first half of the 20th century both the fasces and the [[swastika]] (each symbol having its own unique ancient religious and mythological associations) became heavily identified with the [[authoritarian]]/[[Fascism|fascist]] political movements of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].  During this period the swastika became deeply stigmatized, but the fasces did not undergo a similar process.

The fact that the fasces remained in use in many societies after [[World War II]] may have been due to the fact that prior to Mussolini the fasces had already been adopted and incorporated within the governmental iconography of many governments outside Italy. As such, its use persists as an accepted form of governmental and other iconography in various contexts. (The [[swastika]] remains in common usage in parts of Asia for religious purposes which are also unrelated to early 20th century European fascism.)

The fasces is sometimes confused with the related term ''[[fess]]'', which in [[French heraldry]] is called a ''fasce''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Origin and symbolism==
[[File:Fasces in the Sheldonian Theatre.jpg|thumb|Ornamentation consisting of fasces held in the mouth of a lion inside the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] at Oxford University]]
A few artifacts found showing a thin bundle of rods surrounding a two-headed axe point to a possible Etruscan origin for fasces, but little is known about the Etruscans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, S. (2000). Etruscan civilization: A cultural history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Fasces symbolism might be derived via the Etruscans from the eastern Mediterranean, with the [[labrys]], the [[Anatolia]]n, and [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] double-headed axe, later incorporated into the [[praetor]]ial fasces. There is little archaeological evidence for precise claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Roman Republic]], the fasces had developed into a thicker bundle of [[Betula pubescens|birch]] rods, sometimes surrounding a single-headed axe and tied together with a red leather ribbon into a cylinder. On certain special occasions, the fasces might be decorated with a [[laurel wreath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of the fasces could suggest strength through unity (see [[Unity makes strength]]); a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is very difficult to break. This symbolism occurs in [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] "[[The Old Man and his Sons]]". A similar story is told about the [[Bulgar]] (pre-Bulgarian, proto-Bulgarian) Khan [[Kubrat]], giving rise to the Bulgarian national motto "Union gives strength" (Съединението прави силата). However, bundled birch twigs could also symbolise [[corporal punishment]] (see [[birching]]).

==Republican Rome==
The ''fasces lictoriae'' ("bundles of the lictors") [[symbol]]ised power and authority (''[[imperium]]'') in ancient [[Rome]], beginning with the early [[Roman Kingdom]] and continuing through the republican and [[Roman Empire|imperial]] periods. By republican times, use of the fasces was surrounded with tradition and protocol. A corps of ''apparitores'' (subordinate officials) called [[lictors]] each carried fasces before a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]], in a number corresponding to his rank. Lictors preceded [[Roman consul|consul]]s (and [[proconsul]]s), [[praetor]]s (and [[propraetor]]s), [[Roman dictator|dictator]]s, curule [[aedile]]s, [[quaestor]]s, and the [[Flamen Dialis]] during [[Roman triumph]]s (public celebrations held in Rome after a military conquest).

According to Livy, it is likely that the lictors were an Etruscan tradition, adopted by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8&lt;/ref&gt; The highest magistrate, the ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'', was entitled to twenty-four lictors and fasces, the consul to twelve, the proconsul eleven, the praetor six (two within the ''[[pomerium]]''), the propraetor five, and the curule aediles two.

Another part of the symbolism developed in Republican Rome was the inclusion of just a single-headed axe in the fasces, with the blade projecting from the bundle. The axe indicated that the magistrate's judicial powers (''[[imperium]]'') included capital punishment. Fasces carried within the ''[[Pomerium]]''—the boundary of the sacred inner city of Rome—had their axe blades removed; within the city, the power of life and death rested with the people through their assemblies. During times of emergency, however, the Roman Republic might choose a dictator to lead for a limited time period, who was the only magistrate to be granted capital punishment authority within the Pomerium. Lictors attending the dictator kept the axes in their fasces even inside the Pomerium—a sign that the dictator had the ultimate power in his own hands. There were exceptions to this rule: in 48 BC, guards holding bladed fasces guided [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 48 BCE)|Vatia Isauricus]] to the tribunal of [[Marcus Caelius Rufus|Marcus Caelius]], and Vatia Isauricus used one to destroy Caelius's magisterial chair (''[[Curule Chair|sella curulis]]'').{{Clear}}

An occasional variation on the fasces was the addition of a [[laurel wreath]], symbolizing victory. This occurred during the celebration of a ''[[Roman triumph|Triumph]]'' - essentially a victory parade through Rome by a returning victorious general. Previously, all Republican Roman commanding generals had held high office with imperium, and so, already were entitled to the lictors and fasces.

==Usage==
The modern Italian word ''[[fascio]]'', used in the twentieth century to designate peasant cooperatives and industrial workers' unions, is related to ''fasces''.

Numerous governments and other authorities have used the image of the ''fasces'' as a [[symbol]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] since the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. It also has been used to hearken back to the Roman republic, particularly by those who see themselves as modern-day successors to the old republic or its ideals.

[[Coat of arms of Ecuador|The Ecuadorian coat of arms]] incorporated the fasces in 1830, although it had already been in use in the coat of arm of [[Gran Colombia]] since 1821.

[[Italian Fascism]], which derives its name from the ''fasces'', arguably used this symbolism the most in the twentieth century. The [[British Union of Fascists]] also used it in the 1930s. The ''fasces'', as a widespread and long-established symbol in the West, however, has avoided the [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with much of [[fascist symbolism]], and many authorities continue to display them, including the federal government of the United States.

===France===
A review of the images included in ''Les Grands Palais de France ''Fontainebleau'' ''&lt;ref&gt;''Les Grands Palais de France '''Fontainebleau''', I re Série, Styles Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch. Eggimann, Succ, 106, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les Grands Palais de France : Fontainebleau '', II me Série, Les Appartments D'Anne D'Autriche, De François I er, Et D'Elenonre La Chapelle, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch. Eggimann, Succ, 106, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris, 1912&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that French architects used the Roman fasces (''faisceaux romains'') as a decorative device as early as the reign of [[Louis XIII]] (1610–1643) and continued to employ it through the periods of [[Napoleon I]]'s Empire (1804–1815).

The fasces typically appeared in a context reminiscent of the [[Roman Republic]] and of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[French Revolution]] used many references to the ancient [[Roman Republic]] in its imagery. During the [[French First Republic|First Republic]], topped by the [[Phrygian cap]], the fasces is a tribute to the Roman Republic and means that power belongs to the people. It also symbolizes the "unity and indivisibility of the Republic",&lt;ref name="elysee1"&gt;[http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-faisceau-de-licteur/le-faisceau-de-licteur.5979.html Site of the French Presidency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104072203/http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-faisceau-de-licteur/le-faisceau-de-licteur.5979.html |date=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as stated in the [[French Constitution]]. [[French Revolution of 1848|In 1848]] and [[Government of National Defense|after 1870]], it appears on the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of the French Republic, held by the goddess, [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]]. There is the fasces in the [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Republic]] with the "RF" for ''République française'' (see image below), surrounded by leaves of [[olive tree]] (as a symbol of [[peace]]) and [[oak]] (as a symbol of [[justice]]). While it is used widely by French officials, this symbol never was officially adopted by the government.&lt;ref name="elysee1"/&gt;

The fasces appears on the helmet and the buckle insignia of the French Army's [[Autonomous Corps of Military Justice]], as well as on that service's distinct cap badges for the prosecuting and defending lawyers in a court-martial.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===United States===
[[File:National Guard Bureau (insignia).svg|thumb|[[National Guard Bureau]] insignia]]
Since the original founding of the United States in the 18th century, several offices and institutions in the United States have heavily incorporated representations of the ''fasces'' into much of their iconography.

==== Federal fasces iconography ====
* The reverse of the [[Mercury Dime]], the design used until the adoption of the current FDR dime in 1945, features a fasces.
* In the [[Oval Office]], above the door leading to the exterior walkway, and above the corresponding door on the opposite wall, which leads to the president's private office; note: the fasces depicted have no axes, possibly because in the [[Roman Republic]], the blade was always removed from the bundle whenever the ''fasces'' were carried inside the city, in order to symbolize the rights of citizens against arbitrary state power (see above)
* Two fasces appear on either side of the [[flag of the United States]] behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]], and were added to the chamber's decor during the remodeling project of 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Capitol/1951-Present/ US House of Representatives: Chamber, 1951–Present] history.house.gov website.  Downloaded Aug. 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Mace of the United States House of Representatives]] resembles fasces and consists of thirteen ebony rods bound together in the same fashion as the fasces, topped by a silver eagle on a globe 
* The official [[seal of the United States Senate]] has as one component a pair of crossed fasces
* Fasces ring the base of the [[Statue of Freedom]] atop the [[United States Capitol]] building 
* A frieze on the facade of the [[United States Supreme Court building]] depicts the figure of a Roman [[centurion]] holding a fasces, to represent "order"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c01_e.html The Supreme Court Historical Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128162002/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c01_e.html |date=November 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] uses the fasces on the seal of the [[National Guard Bureau]], and it appears in the insignia of Regular Army officers assigned to National Guard liaison and in the insignia and unit symbols of National Guard units themselves; for instance, the regimental crest of the [[71st Infantry Regiment (New York)]] of the New York National Guard consisted of a gold fasces set on a blue background 
* At the [[Lincoln Memorial]], Lincoln's seat of state bears the fasces—without axes—on the fronts of its arms; fasces also appear on the pylons flanking the main staircase leading into the memorial 
* The official [[seal (device)|seal]] of the [[United States Tax Court]] bears the fasces at its center 
* Four fasces flank the two bronze plaques on either side of the bust of Lincoln memorializing his [[Gettysburg Address]] at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 
* The seal of the United States Courts Administrative Office includes a fasces behind crossed quill and scroll
* In the Washington Monument, there is a statue of George Washington leaning on a fasces 
* A fasces is a common element in U.S. Army Military Police heraldry, most visibly on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the [[18th Military Police Brigade]] and the [[42nd Military Police Brigade]]
* A fasces also appears [[shoulder sleeve insignia]] of the [[United States Army Reserve Legal Command|U.S. Army Reserve Legal Command]]
* Seated beside George Washington, a figure holds a fasces as part of ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'', a fresco mural suspended above the rotunda of the [[United States Capitol Building]].

==== State, local and other fasces iconography ====
* The main entrance hallways in the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] have lamps that are decorated with stone fasces motifs; in the woodwork before the podium of the speaker of the assembly, several double-bladed fasces are carved, but in the woodwork before the podium of the senate president are several single-bladed fasces 
* The grand seal of [[Harvard University]] inside Memorial Church is flanked by two inward-pointing fasces; the seal is located directly below the 112&amp;nbsp;m (368&amp;nbsp;ft) steeple and the [[Great Seal of the United States]] inside the Memorial Room; the walls of the room list the names of Harvard students, faculty, and alumni who gave their lives in service of the [[United States]] during [[World War I]] along with an empty tomb depicting [[Alma Mater]] holding a slain Harvard student 
* The fasces appears on the [[Seal of Colorado|state seal of Colorado]], U.S., beneath the "All-seeing eye" (or [[Eye of Providence]]) and above the mountains and mines 
* The hallmark of the [[Kerr &amp; Co]] silver company was a fasces 
* On the seal of the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]], a figure carries a fasces; the seal appears on the borough flag; fasces also can be seen in the stone columns at [[Grand Army Plaza]] and on a flagpole in [[Washington Square Park]]

'''Golden Week''' is the colloquial term for a unique period of early voting time during Ohio's election season in which citizens can register to vote and cast an absentee ballot on the same day.

== History ==
Golden Week was created in 2005 with new early voting legislation that allowed voters to cast absentee ballots up to 35 days before the election. The legislation was passed in response to vast complications and inefficiencies experienced during the 2004 presidential election. On top of the technical issues with vote counts and voting machines, there were many logistical issues that discouraged turnout and voter participation. Precincts were ill-equipped to handle the number of voters coming out, and in some cases waiting lines were reported to be as high as nine hours long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Voting Problems in Ohio Set Off an Alarm|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/politics/campaign/voting-problems-in-ohio-set-off-an-alarm.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2004-11-07|access-date = 2015-10-08|issn = 0362-4331|first = Adam|last = Liptak}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion of voting time resulted in about a week of overlap with the deadline of voter registration, which was October 6.

== Usage ==
As with any period of early voting, citizens used Golden Week (and the rest of the period that did not overlap with registration deadlines) as an opportunity to cast their ballots at a time more convenient for them than Election Day itself. The added ability to vote on the same day of registration created an ideal opportunity for those who could not afford to take too much time out of their work schedules, or other obligations. While people from all walks of life have reasons to take advantage of early voting, the practice is more often associated with minorities and low-income citizens. The number of people who took advantage of these opportunities proved to be considerable. During the 2012 general election, approximately 90,000 people cast votes during Golden Week, which translated to about 14% of the total early, in-person absentee ballots cast that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/018-01_smith_report.pdf|title = ANALYSIS OF EFFECTS OF SENATE BILL 238 AND DIRECTIVE 2014-06 ON EARLY IN-PERSON (EIP) ABSENTEE VOTING BY BLACKS AND WHITES IN OHIO|date = 30 June 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Smith|first = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several instances of organized intent to take advantage of the opportunities provided by Golden Week, as well. Many predominantly African-American churches coordinated "Souls to the Polls" campaigns designed to encourage their communities to get registered and exercise their voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Take Your Souls to the Polls: Voting Early in Ohio |url=https://www.aclu.org/podcast/take-your-souls-polls-voting-early-ohio |website=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contention and elimination ==
Golden Week and early voting opportunities in general haven been the subject of much debate among policymakers. Some see early voting as a safeguard against the disenfranchisement of minority and lower-income citizens who are believed to use such services more often. According to some studies, there is truth to this. Data from the Pew Research Center states that youth, minorities and the poor are much more likely to be nonvoters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Party of Nonvoters|url = http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/31/the-party-of-nonvoters-2/|website = Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corroborated with research from Caltech and MIT, it becomes clearer why this might be the case. Their study found that a multitude of reasons for not voting are more often used by minorities and youth than whites and older citizens. These reasons include illness, being too busy, or not having the proper transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Are the Poor and Minorities Less Likely to Vote?|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/why-are-the-poor-and-minorities-less-likely-to-vote/282896/|website = The Atlantic|accessdate = 2015-12-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is factors such as those that lead many to believe that having ample early voting opportunities is particularly beneficial to those demographics. In addition to that, some believe that early voting opportunities help offset logistical issues during election day, and promote a larger overall voter turnout. Others see offering voting opportunities to the extent that Ohio has as a waste of resources and as a detriment to informed decision-making. To some, voting too early before an election represents making too hasty a decision, as important information can surface any time that has potential to shift opinions. Others believe that tighter voting procedures help minimize fraud. As such, Ohio's voting policies have been an ever-present topic in the state's political arena.

=== NAACP v. Husted ===
This debate came to a head in 2014 when the Ohio House passed Senate Bill 238, which eliminated Golden Week. This action was followed by a directive from Secretary of State John Husted, which set statewide early voting hours to be used in forthcoming elections. Husted's opponents criticized the directive for its lack of evening hours, as well as for not providing hours on Sundays or on the Monday prior to Election Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Golden Week on the chopping block for Ohio Republicans and Democrats for years (time line)|url = http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/11/golden_week_on_the_chopping_bl.html|website = cleveland.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discontent with these measures eventually prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit that came to be known as NAACP v. Husted, as the complaint was filed on behalf of several civil rights groups including the Ohio Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the League of Women Voters of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACLU Files Federal Lawsuit Challenging Ohio’s Latest Attempts to Slash Early Voting Opportunities|url = https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-files-federal-lawsuit-challenging-ohios-latest-attempts-slash-early-voting-opportunities|website = American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case  was contested until it made its way to the US Supreme Court, which did not fully consider the case but still stayed the decision of the lower courts to uphold Husted's legislation. Due to persistent action by the ACLU, however, a new compromise was reached in April 2015, in which Husted agreed to restore some weekend and evening voting hours. Golden Week remained eliminated.

There has been discontent since the elimination of Golden Week from invested groups such as the ACLU, but until recently there has not been much action in the form of concentrated effort to reinstate the lost voting time. As of November 2015, attorneys have filed a new lawsuit representing Ohio democrats aimed at getting the judiciary to reexamine the state's voting policies regarding early ballot opportunities as well as rules on [[provisional ballot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal judge hearing dispute over Ohio’s voting rules|url = http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20151116/federal-judge-hearing-dispute-over-ohios-voting-rules|website = www.news-herald.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''golden age of Jewish culture in Spain''' coincided with the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, a period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] throughout much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. During intermittent periods of time, [[Jews]] were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed. 

The nature and length of this "Golden Age" has been a subject of much debate, as there were at least three Golden Ages interrupted by periods of oppression of all non-Muslims. A few scholars give the start of the Golden Age as  711–718, the [[Umayyad Conquest of Iberia|Muslim conquest of Iberia]]. Others date it from 912, during the rule of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]. The end of the age is variously given as 1031, when the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Caliphate of Cordoba]] ended; 1066, the date of the [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada massacre]]; 1090, when the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] invaded; or the mid-12th century, when the [[Almohades|Almohads]] invaded.

==The nature of the Golden Age==

Having invaded the areas throughout Southern Spain, and coming to rule in a matter of seven years, Islamic rulers were confronted with many questions relating to the implementation of Islamic Rule on a non-Islamic society. The coexistence of Muslims, Jews, and Christians during this time is revered by many writers. [[Al-Andalus]] was a key center of Jewish life during the early [[Middle Ages]], producing important scholars and one of the most stable and wealthy Jewish communities and a relatively educated society for the Muslim occupiers and their Jewish collaborators, as well as some Christians who openly collaborated with the Muslims and Jews. As [[Sefarad]], al-Andalus was the "capital" of world Judaism. 

[[María Rosa Menocal]], a specialist in Iberian literature at [[Yale University]], claims  that "tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828225825/http://twbookmark.com/books/52/0316566888/press_release.html The Ornament of the World by María Rosa Menocal]&lt;/ref&gt; Menocal's 2003 book, ''The Ornament of the World'', argues that the Jewish [[dhimmi]]s living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to ''al-Andalus'', where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trades were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on [[proselytisation]] and, sometimes, on [[synagogue]] construction.

[[Bernard Lewis]] takes issue with this view, calling it ahistorical and exaggerated. He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality nor even pretend that it did, arguing that it would have been both a "theological as well as a logical absurdity."&lt;ref name = lewis&gt;Lewis, Bernard W (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; However, also Lewis states:

{{Quotation|Generally, the Jewish people were allowed to practice their religion and live according to the laws and scriptures of their community. Furthermore, the restrictions to which they were subject were social and symbolic rather than tangible and practical in character. That is to say, these regulations served to define the relationship between the two communities, and not to oppress the Jewish population.&lt;ref name = lewis /&gt;|}} Jews were allowed certain freedoms but, like their Christian counterparts, were prohibited from having administrative authority over Muslims except in a few cases.

[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]], Professor of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], in his ''Under Crescent and Cross'', calls the idealized interfaith utopia a "myth" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as [[Heinrich Graetz]] in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name = cohen&gt;{{cite book |last= Cohen |first= Mark R. |title= Under Crescent and Cross |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |date=October 1995 |isbn= 0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This myth was met with the "counter-myth" of the "neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history" by [[Bat Yeor]] and others,&lt;ref name = cohen /&gt; which also "cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review |year=1997 |volume=88 |issue=1/2 |pages=76–78|doi=10.2307/1455066 |title=  Review of Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages by Mark R. Cohen |author= Daniel J. Lasker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of the Golden Age==
Prior to 581, the Jews experienced a Golden Age under the Arian Visigoth occupiers of Spain.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The [[Visigoths]] were mainly indifferent towards Jews and allowed them to grow and prosper. After the [[Visigoths]] joined the [[Catholic Church]], they placed ever greater economic burdens on the Jewish population, and later persecuted them severely. It is possible that Jews welcomed the [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and mainly [[Berber people|Berber]] conquerors in the 8th century.

A period of tolerance dawned for the Jews of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from North Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest.{{cn|date=April 2018}} North African Jewish immigrants  and immigrants from the Middle East bolstered the Jewish population, and made Muslim Spain probably the biggest center of contemporary Jews. Especially after 912, during the reign of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] and his son, [[Al-Hakam II]], the Jews prospered culturally, and some notable figures held high posts in the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]]. Jewish philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, poets, and rabbinical scholars composed highly rich cultural and scientific work. Many devoted themselves to the study of the sciences and philosophy, composing many of the most valuable texts of [[Jewish Philosophy]]. Jews took part in the overall prosperity of Muslim [[Al-Andalus]]. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In Toledo after the Christian reconquest in 1085, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages in the so-called [[Toledo School of Translators]], as they had been previously in translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to [[botany]], [[geography]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="weiner"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim] by Rebecca Weiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Abd al-Rahman's court physician and minister was [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], the patron of [[Menahem ben Saruq]], [[Dunash ben Labrat]], and other Jewish scholars and poets. In following centuries, Jewish thought flourished under famous figures such as [[Samuel Ha-Nagid]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] and [[Judah Halevi]].&lt;ref name="weiner" /&gt; During 'Abd al-Rahman's  term of power, the scholar [[Moses ben Hanoch|Moses ben Enoch]] was appointed [[rabbi]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and as a consequence [[al-Andalus]] became the center of [[Talmud]]ic study, and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] the meeting-place of Jewish savants.

This was a time of partial Jewish autonomy. As "[[dhimmi]]s", or "protected non-Muslims", Jews in the [[Islam]]ic world paid the [[jizya]], which was administered separately from the [[zakat]] paid by Muslims. The [[jizya]] has been viewed variously as a head tax, as payment for non-conscription in the military (as non-Muslims were normally prohibited from bearing arms or receiving martial training), or as a tribute. Jews had their own [[legal system]] and [[social services]]. [[Monotheism|Monotheist]] religions of the [[people of the book]] were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith, such as bells and processions, were discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Fred J. Hill et al., ''A History of the Islamic World'' 2003 {{ISBN|0-7818-1015-9}}, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the treatment of Jews in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] and medieval [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], the Jews were far more integrated in [[Political aspects of Islam|the political]] and [[Islamic economics in the world|economic life of Islamic society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R.

Other authors criticize the modern notion of Al-Andalus being a tolerant society of equal opportunities for all religious groups as a "myth".&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"&gt;Darío Fernández-Morera: [http://www.mmisi.org/ir/41_02/fernandez-morera.pdf "The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise"], ''The Intercollegiate Review'', Fall 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–31&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was more often than not marked by segregation and mutual hostility. In the [[1066 Granada massacre]] of much of the Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogromes in the [[Rhineland]] slightly later.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"/&gt; The notable Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the Almohads. In Letter to Yemen, Maimonides wrote:

{{Quotation|Dear brothers, because of our many sins Hashem has cast us among this nation, the Arabs, who are treating us badly. They pass laws designed to cause us distress and make us despised. ... Never has there been a nation that hated, humiliated and loathed us as much as this one.&lt;ref name="Finkel"&gt;Avraham Yaakov Finkel (translator): "Rambam: Selected Letters of Maimonides", Yeshivat Beit Moshe, Scranton, PA, 1994, {{ISBN|0-9626226-3-X}}, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==End of the Golden Age==
With the death of Al-Hakam II in 976, the Caliphate began to dissolve, and the position of the Jews became more precarious under the various smaller kingdoms.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The first major persecution was the [[1066 Granada massacre]], which occurred on 30 December, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in [[Granada]], [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jew]]ish [[vizier]] [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] and massacred many of the Jewish population of the city. According to one source, "more than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule.
[[Image:Manuscript page by Maimonides Arabic in Hebrew letters.jpg|thumb|150px|Manuscript page by [[Maimonides]], one of the greatest Jewish scholars of Al Andalus, born in [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]]. [[Arabic language]] in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters]]

Beginning in 1090, the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], a puritan Muslim sect from [[Morocco]]. Even under the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under [[Ali ibn Yusuf|Ali III]], than under his father [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]]). Among those who held the title of "[[vizier]]" or "[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]]" in Almoravid times were the poet and physician [[Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam]], [[Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial]], [[Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar]], and [[Solomon ibn Farusal]]. The Almoravids were ousted from the peninsula in 1148; however, the region was again invaded, this time by the even more puritanical [[Almohades]].

During the reign of these Berber dynasties, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which had been [[Reconquista|reconquered]] in 1085 by Christian forces.

The major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity in the [[Alhambra decree]] of 1492 and a similar [[Portuguese Inquisition|decree]] by  [[Portugal]] in 1496.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8730">A '''hierarchical organization''' is an [[organizational structure]] where every entity in the [[organization]], except one, is [[subordinate]] to a single other entity. This arrangement is a form of a [[hierarchy]]. In an organization, the hierarchy usually consists of a singular/group of [[Power (social and political)|power]] at the top with subsequent levels of power beneath them. This is the dominant mode of organization among large organizations; most [[corporation]]s, [[Forms of government|governments]], and [[organized religion]]s are hierarchical organizations with different levels of [[management]], power or [[authority]]. For example, the broad, top-level overview of the general organization of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic Church]] consists of the [[Pope]], then the [[Cardinal (Catholic)|Cardinals]], then the [[Archbishop]]s, and so on. 

Members of hierarchical organizational structures chiefly communicate with their immediate superior and with their immediate subordinates. Structuring organizations in this way is useful partly because it can reduce the communication overhead by limiting information flow; this is also its major limitation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Visualization==
A hierarchy is typically visualized as a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], where the height of the ranking or person depicts their power status and the width of that level represents how many people or business divisions are at that level relative to the whole—the highest-ranking people are at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]], and there are very few of them; the [[Base (geometry)|base]] may include thousands of people who have no subordinates. These hierarchies are typically depicted with a [[tree structure|tree]] or [[triangle]] [[diagram]], creating an [[organizational chart]] or organigram. Those nearest the top have more power than those nearest the bottom, and there being fewer people at the top than at the bottom. As a result, superiors in a hierarchy generally have higher status and command greater rewards than their subordinates.

==Common models==
All governments and most companies have similar structures. Traditionally, the [[monarch]] was the pinnacle of the [[State (polity)|state]]. In many countries, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] provided a formal [[social structure]] that established hierarchical links at every level of society, with the monarch at the top. 

In modern post-feudal states the nominal top of the hierarchy still remains the [[head of state]], which may be a [[president]] or a [[constitutional monarch]], although in many modern states the powers of the head of state are delegated among different bodies. Below the head, there is commonly a [[senate]], [[parliament]] or [[congress]], which in turn often delegate the day-to-day running of the country to a [[prime minister]]. In many [[democracies]], the people are considered to be the notional top of the hierarchy, over the head of state; in reality, the people's power is restricted to voting in elections.

In business, the business owner traditionally occupied the pinnacle of the [[organization]]. In most modern large companies, there is now no longer a single dominant shareholder, and the collective power of the business owners is for most purposes delegated to a [[board of directors]], which in turn delegates the day-to-day running of the company to a [[managing director]] or [[CEO]]. Again, although the shareholders of the company are the nominal top of the hierarchy, in reality many companies are run at least in part as personal fiefdoms by their management; [[corporate governance]] rules are an attempt to mitigate this tendency.

== Studies ==
The [[organizational development]] theorist [[Elliott Jacques]] identified a special role for hierarchy in his concept of [[requisite organization]]. 
 
The [[iron law of oligarchy]], introduced by [[Robert Michels]], describes the inevitable tendency of hierarchical organizations to become [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] in their decision making.

The [[Peter principle|Peter Principle]] is a term coined by [[Laurence J. Peter]] in which the selection of a candidate for a position in an  hierarchical organization is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and managers in an hierarchical organization "rise to the level of their incompetence." 

[[Hierarchiology]] is another term coined by Laurence J. Peter, described in his humorous book of the same name, to refer to the study of hierarchical organizations and the behavior of their members.

{{quote|Having formulated the Principle, I discovered that I had inadvertently founded a new science, hierarchiology, the study of hierarchies. The term hierarchy was originally used to describe the system of church government by priests graded into ranks. The contemporary meaning includes any organization whose members or employees are arranged in order of rank, grade or class. Hierarchiology, although a relatively recent discipline, appears to have great applicability to the fields of public and private administration.|Dr. [[Laurence J. Peter]] and [[Raymond Hull]]|''[[The Peter Principle]]: Why Things Always Go Wrong''}}

[[The IRG Solution – hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it]] argued that hierarchies were inherently incompetent, and were only able to function due to large amounts of informal [[lateral communication]] fostered by private informal networks.

==Criticism and alternatives==
In the work of diverse theorists such as [[William James]] (1842–1910), [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) and [[Hayden White]], important critiques of hierarchical epistemology are advanced. James famously asserts in his work "Radical Empiricism" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved. A hesitation to declare success upon the discovery of ambiguities leaves heterarchy at an artificial and subjective disadvantage in the scope of human knowledge. This bias is an artifact of an aesthetic or pedagogical preference for hierarchy, and not necessarily an expression of objective observation.

Hierarchies and hierarchical thinking has been criticized by many people, including [[Susan McClary]] and one political philosophy which is vehemently opposed to hierarchical organization: [[anarchism]]. [[Heterarchy]] is the most commonly proposed alternative to hierarchy and this has been combined with [[responsible autonomy]] by [[Gerard Fairtlough]] in his work on [[Triarchy]] theory. The most beneficial aspect of a hierarchical organization is the clear command that is established. However, hierarchy may become dismantled by abuse of power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Amidst constant innovation in information and communication technologies, hierarchical authority structures are giving way to greater decision-making latitude for individuals and more flexible definitions of job activities and this new style of work presents a challenge to existing organizational forms, with some research studies contrasting traditional organizational forms against groups that operate as online communities that are characterized by personal motivation and the satisfaction of making one's own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Rosson, Rosson (2007). The Future of Work: What Does Online Community Have to Do with It? 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)&lt;/ref&gt;  With all levels of an organization having access to information and communication via digital means, power structures align more as a [[wirearchy]], enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results.

The '''history of parliamentary procedure''' refers to the origins and evolution of [[parliamentary law]] used by [[deliberative assembly|deliberative assemblies]].

== Origins ==
''[[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure|Demeter's Manual]]'' traces the origins of parliamentary law, by which is meant orderly deliberation and action by an assembly of persons or a body of citizens, to c. 750 BC in Greece. It was during that era that the idea of [[self-government]], with the right to deliberate in assembly and to speak and vote on public questions, was conceived. The Greeks instituted the Athenian [[agora]], equivalent to the American [[town meeting]], consisting of the whole body of male citizens above eighteen years of age, which met forty times each year on the [[Acropolis]]. Any citizen could address the meeting from the [[Bema]] and vote on questions before the assembly.

Circa 450 BC, the Romans adopted the concept of self-government and expanded it with the institution of the [[Roman Forum]], where Roman orators addressed the General Assembly from the [[Rostra]] and the people afterward voted on pending questions.&lt;ref name=DemIntro&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anglo-Saxon tribes ==
According to ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'' (RONR), one commonly held view is that "our own tradition of parliamentary process may be traced to ways of life in Anglo-Saxon tribes before their migration to the island of Britain starting in the fifth century A.D. Among these peoples on the continent of Europe, the tribe was the largest regularly existing political unit."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = xxxi|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the early Anglo-Saxon kingdoms had its own [[witenagemot]], which was a national assembly consisting of freemen who owned land.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The structure of the Anglo-Saxon governmental machinery was left largely intact even after the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, with the Norman kings assembling a "Great Council" of court officials, barons, and prelates that was constitutionally a continuation of the witenagemot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = xxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early parliament ==
In the 13th and early 14th centuries, the [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] was converted into the [[English Parliament]]. The distinguishing feature of these early parliaments was that the barons were invited to not only express their opinions individually to the king, but to discuss with each other the business "of king and kingdom" rather than only "the king's business." The earliest parliament clearly identifiable as of this character was held in 1258. It was during the Thirteenth century that the rules of parliamentary law started taking form as a science.&lt;ref name="DemIntro" /&gt; The [[clerk of the House of Commons]] began writing the [[Journal of the House of Commons]] on his own initiative in 1547, which became a source of precedent in parliamentary procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Legislative Procedure: Parliamentary Practices and the Course of Business'' notes that "many usages were crystallized, so to speak, by the ruling of a Speaker or by some formal action of Parliament, such as a resolution or simple vote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legislative Procedure: Parliamentary Practices and the Course of Business|author=Luce, Robert|year=1922|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British parliamentary procedures were carried over to the American colonies and became the foundations of legislative procedure in the U.S. states. [[Jefferson's Manual]], published in 1801, recognized indebtedness to [[John Hatsell]]'s ''[[Precedents of Proceedings in the House of Commons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual of Parliamentary Practice|author=Jefferson, Thomas|year=1801|pages=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], parliamentary procedure was perfected into a system which was described in the U.S. House ''Rules and Manual'' thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rules and Manual|author=Deschler, Lewis|publisher=U.S. House|pages=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|They are perhaps the most finely adjusted, scientifically balanced,and highly technical rules of any parliamentary body in the world. Under them a majority may work its will at all times in the face of the most determined and vigorous opposition of a minority}}

The development of parliamentary law was similar to that of the [[common law]]. ''[[Mason's Manual]]'' notes that parliamentary law was built on precedents created by decisions on [[points of order]] or [[appeal (motion)|appeals]] and by decisions of courts. It was guided in its development by the authority to make rules inherent in every deliberative body. The common law of parliamentary procedure, however, did not rest upon mere custom but upon reasonable and equitable custom. ''Mason's Manual'' notes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=MAS|pages=33–34|edition=2000|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The state legislatures and local governmental bodies copied from Congress. However, the procedure of the state legislatures, local legislative bodies and voluntarily associations now differs greatly from the procedure of Parliament and Congress. While Congress is governed largely by rules adopted by the houses of Congress to meet their local and special needs, the states legislatures &amp;ndash; and particularly, the more local bodies, both public and private &amp;ndash; are governed by a branch of the common law based upon court decisions and upon precedents and customs of deliberative bodies.}}

== 20th century to present ==
By the beginning of the 20th century, ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', had been almost universally adopted by ordinary societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/HistoricalVignettes/GeneralHistory/038ChurchMeetings.aspx|title = Historical Vignette 038 - An Army Engineer Brought Order to Church Meetings|date = November 2001|accessdate = 2015-12-03|website = |publisher = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Office of History|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, [[Alice Sturgis]] published the ''Sturgis Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure'', later revised in 2001 by AIP as ''[[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]'', arguing that organizations need not continue operating under 19th century rules, and that it would be better to go with a simpler set of rules. In 1969 [[George Demeter]] published  ''[[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure]], Blue Book Edition'', that was longer and more in-depth than the then current version of ''Robert's Rules of Order Revised'' (ROR). In the 21st century, the latest editions of ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'' included coverage of current practices such as electronic meetings and sending communication by electronic means such as e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = xxvi-xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The horse shoe metaphor was used as early as during the [[Weimar Republic]] to describe the ideology of the [[Black Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Backes|first=Uwe|author-link=Uwe Backes|title=Politischer Extremismus in demokratischen Verfassungsstaaten|trans-title=Political Extremism in Democratic Constitutional States|language=de|location=Wiesbaden|publisher=Springer|date=1989|page=251-252|isbn=978-3-531-11946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern usage ==
In a 2006 book, political scientist Jeff Taylor wrote: "It may be more useful to think of the Left and the Right as two components of populism, with elitism residing in the Center. The political spectrum may be linear, but it is not a straight line. It is shaped like a horseshoe".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jeff (2006), Where Did the Party Go? (University of Missouri Press), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, the term was used when discussing an alleged resurgent hostility towards Jews and [[new antisemitism]] from both the far-left and the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Tzvi|last = Fleischer|date = 31 October 2006|title = The Political Horseshoe again|url = http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2006/31-11/scribb31-11.htm|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110516212834/http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2006/31-11/scribb31-11.htm|archivedate = 16 May 2011|quote = I think Mr. Loewenstein has done a good job demonstrating why many people believe, as the "political horseshoe" theory states, that there is a lot more common ground between the far left, where Loewenstein dwells politically, and the far right views of someone like Betty Luks than people on the left would care to admit.|work = Australia/Israel Review|publisher = [[AIJAC]]|accessdate = 27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 essay, [[Josef Joffe]] (a visiting fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], a conservative think tank)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Josef Joffe Distinguished Visiting Fellow| url = http://www.hoover.org/profiles/josef-joffe|}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: {{quote|Will globalization survive the gloom?

In Germany, it was left-wing populism ("Die Linke"); in Austria it was a bunch of right-wing parties that garnered almost 30% in the 2008 election. Left and right together illustrated once more the "horseshoe" theory of modern politics: As the iron is bent backward, the two extremes almost touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = New Year's Essay 2009| date = 2008-12-22| publisher = [[Roland Berger Strategy Consultants]]| url = http://www.rolandberger.com/news/2008-12-22-rbsc-news-NewYearEssay.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054730/http://www.rolandberger.com/news/2008-12-22-rbsc-news-NewYearEssay.html| archivedate = 2009-02-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2015, reformist Muslim [[Maajid Nawaz]] invoked the horseshoe theory while lamenting a common tendency on the far-left and far-right towards the compiling and publishing of "[[Blacklisting|lists of political foes]]",&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news | title = The left's witchunt against Muslims| date = 2015-12-14|publisher= [[The Daily Beast]] | url = http://maajidnawaz.com/the-lefts-witch-hunt-against-muslims/}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding:
{{quote|As the political horseshoe theory attributed to Jean-Pierre Faye highlights, if we travel far-left enough, we find the very same sneering, nasty and reckless bully-boy tactics used by the far-right. The two extremes of the political spectrum end up meeting like a horseshoe, at the top, which to my mind symbolizes totalitarian control from above. In their quest for ideological purity, Stalin and Hitler had more in common than modern neo-Nazis and far-left agitators would care to admit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In a recent article for [[Eurozine]] titled "How Right is the Left?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = How Right is the Left?| date = 2018-05-15| publisher = [[Eurozine]]| url = https://www.eurozine.com/how-right-is-the-left/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyrylo Tkachenko wrote about the common cause found recently between the far-left and the far-right in [[Ukraine]]:
{{quote|The pursuit of a common political agenda is a trend discernible at both extremes of the political spectrum. Though this phenomenon manifests itself primarily through content-related overlaps, I believe there are good reasons to refer to it as a red-brown alliance. Its commonalities are based on shared anti-liberal resentment. Of course, there remain palpable differences between far left and the far right. But we should not underestimate the dangers already posed by these left-right intersections, as well as what we might lose if the resentment-driven backlash becomes mainstream.}}

== Criticism ==
The horseshoe theory has been criticized not just by people on both ends of the political spectrum who oppose being grouped with those they consider to be their polar opposites, but also by those who see horseshoe theory as oversimplifying political ideologies and as ignoring fundamental differences between them.

Simon Choat, a senior lecturer in political theory at [[Kingston University]], criticizes horseshoe theory from a leftist perspective. He argues that far-left and far-right ideologies only share similarities in the vaguest sense in that they both oppose the [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] ''[[status quo]]'', but the two sides both have very different reasons and very different aims for doing so. Choat uses the issue of globalization as an example. Both the far-left and the far-right attack [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]] and its elites, but have conflicting views on who those elites are and conflicting reasons for attacking them: {{quote|For the left, the problem with globalisation is that it has given free rein to capital and entrenched economic and political inequality. The solution is therefore to place constraints on capital and/or to allow people to have the same freedom of movement currently given to capital, goods, and services. They want an ''alternative'' globalisation. For the right, the problem with globalisation is that it has corroded supposedly traditional and homogeneous cultural and ethnic communities – their solution is therefore to ''reverse'' globalisation, protecting national capital and placing further restrictions on the movement of people.&lt;ref name=choat&gt;Choat, Simon (May 12, 2017) [https://theconversation.com/horseshoe-theory-is-nonsense-the-far-right-and-far-left-have-little-in-common-77588 "‘Horseshoe theory’ is nonsense – the far right and far left have little in common"] ''The Conversation''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Choat also argues that although proponents of the horseshoe theory may cite examples of alleged history of collusion between [[Fascism|fascists]] and [[Communism|communists]], those on the far-left usually oppose the rise of far-right or fascist regimes in their countries. Instead, he argues that it has been centrists who have supported far-right and fascist regimes that they prefer in power over socialist ones.&lt;ref name=choat /&gt;

'''Integral nationalism''' ({{lang-fr|nationalisme intégral}}) is a type of [[nationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;David Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ruiGAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Contemporary Nationalism], Routledge, 2003, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More recently, [[Peter Alter]] discussed integral nationalism in his book ''Nationalismus'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Integral nationalism is one of five types of [[nationalism]] defined by [[Carlton Hayes]] in his 1928 book ''The Historical Evolution of Modern Nationalism.''&lt;/ref&gt; originated in 19th-century [[France]] and opposed to [[Risorgimento nationalism]].

==Overview==
Whereas risorgimento nationalism applies to a [[nation]] seeking to establish a liberal [[State (polity)|state]] (for example the [[Risorgimento]] in [[Italy]] and similar movements in [[Greece]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Japan]] in the 19th century or [[civic nationalism]], e.g., [[American nationalism]]), integral nationalism results after a nation has achieved [[independence]] and has already established a state. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism. Some of the qualities that characterise integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive [[expansionist]] [[militarism]]. Integral states are [[totalitarian]] and the government or state dominates all aspects of society.

Integral nationalism generally tends to arise in states (such as colonies or countries that do not have [[sovereignty]]) where a strong [[military]] ethos has become entrenched through a struggle for independence, resulting in the belief that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state once the state attains independence. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.

'''Jewish political movements''' refer to the organized efforts of [[Jew]]s to build their own [[Political party|political parties]] or otherwise represent their interest in politics outside the [[Jewish community]]. From the time of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] by the Romans to the foundation of [[Israel]] the Jewish people had no territory, and, until the 19th century they by-and-large were also denied equal rights in the countries in which they lived. Thus, until the 19th century effort for the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]], almost all Jewish political struggles were internal, and dealt primarily with either religious issues or issues of a particular Jewish community. (See [[Judaism and politics]].){{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Birth of Jewish political movements==
[[Image:Moses Mendelson P7160073.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Moses Mendelssohn, the founder of the [[Haskalah]] movement]]
Since Jews were excluded as outsiders throughout Europe, they were mostly shut out of politics or any sort of participation in the wider political and social sphere of the nations in which they were involved until the Enlightenment, and its Jewish counterpart, [[Haskalah]], made popular movements possible. As long as the Jews lived in [[Religious segregation|segregated]] communities, and as long as all avenues of social intercourse with their [[gentile]] neighbors were closed to them, the [[rabbi]] was the most influential member of the Jewish community. In addition to being a religious scholar and clergy, a rabbi also acted as a civil [[judge]] in all cases in which both parties were Jews. Rabbis sometimes had other important administrative powers, together with the community elders. The rabbinate was the highest aim of many Jewish boys, and the study of the [[Torah]] (first five books of the Bible) and the [[Talmud]] was the means of obtaining that coveted position, or one of many other important communal distinctions. Haskalah followers advocated "coming out of the [[ghetto]]", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.  The example of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]  (1729&amp;ndash;1786), a [[Prussia]]n Jew and grandfather of the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]], served to lead this movement. Mendelssohn's extraordinary success as a popular philosopher and [[man of letters]] revealed hitherto unsuspected possibilities of integration and acceptance of Jews among non-Jews.

The changes caused by the Haskalah movement coincided with rising revolutionary movements throughout Europe.  Despite these movements, only France, Britain, and the Netherlands had granted the Jews in their countries equal rights with gentiles after the [[French Revolution]] in 1796.  Elsewhere in Europe, especially where Jews were most concentrated in Central and Eastern Europe, Jews were not granted equal rights. It was in the revolutionary atmosphere of the mid-19th century that the first true Jewish political movements would take place.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Emancipation movements==
{{see also|Jewish Emancipation|Haskalah}}
During the early stages of [[Jewish Emancipation|Jewish emancipation movements]], Jews were simply part of the general effort to achieve freedom and rights that drove popular uprisings like the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals like [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Jacoby]], [[Gabriel Riesser]], [[Berr Isaac Berr]], and [[Lionel Nathan Rothschild]] were active with the general movement towards liberty and political freedom.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Still, in the face of persistent [[anti-semitic]] incidents like the [[Damascus affair|Damascus Blood Libel]] of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations started to form in order to push for the emancipation and protection of Jews.  The [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] under [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Central Consistory]] of Paris, and the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]] founded by [[Adolphe Crémieux]], all began working to assure the freedom of the Jews throughout the middle of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Socialist and Labor movements==
{{see also|Jewish left}}
Frustration with the slow pace of Jewish acceptance into European society, and a revolutionary [[utopianism]], led to a growing interest in proto-[[socialism|socialist]] and [[communist]] movements, especially as early socialist leaders, like [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], preached the emancipation of the Jews. [[Moses Hess]] played a role in introducing [[Karl Marx]] (who was descended from a long line of rabbis) and [[Friedrich Engels]] to [[historical materialism]].  The Jewish [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], founded the first actual workers' party in Germany, the [[General German Workers' Association]] (which ultimately merged with other parties to become the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]) and made Jewish emancipation one of his goals.  {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The more intellectual socialist movements of the Jews in Western Europe never gathered steam as emancipation took hold. In Eastern Europe and Russia, however, the ''Bund''{{spaced ndash}}the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Labor Union]]{{spaced ndash}}founded in 1897, became a key force in organizing Jews, and, at least initially, the major opponent of another Jewish political movement of the time, [[Zionism]]. There were other Jewish socialist parties in Russia, like the ([[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialist]]) [[Zionist Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Jewish Socialist Workers Party]], which united their destinies in 1917 as the [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party]]. Another left-wing Russian Jewish party was the [[Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poalei Zion)]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Zionist movements==
{{main|Zionism}}
The aim of Zionism was to set up a secular state in the vicinity of the Biblical [[Land of Israel]]. Zionism, or the idea of a restored national homeland and common identity for the Jews, had already started to take shape by the mid-19th century, with Jewish thinkers such as [[Moses Hess]] whose 1862 work ''Rome and Jerusalem; The Last National Question'' argued for the Jews to settle in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] as a means of settling the [[national question]]. Hess proposed a socialist state in which the Jews would become [[agrarianism|agrarianised]] through a process of "redemption of the soil" which would transform the Jewish community into a "true" nation, in that Jews would occupy the productive layers of society rather than being an intermediary non-productive merchant class, which is how he perceived Jews in Europe. Hess, along with later thinkers such as [[Nahum Syrkin]] and [[Ber Borochov]], is considered a founder of ''Socialist Zionism'' and [[Labour Zionism]] and one of the intellectual forebears of the [[kibbutz]] movement. Others like Rabbi Zvi Kalischer viewed a return to the Jewish homeland as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy through natural means.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Image:Theodore Herzl.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodor Herzl]], a key figure in the development of Zionism]]
As the 19th century wore on, the persecution of the Jews in Eastern Europe where emancipation had not occurred to the extent it did in Western Europe (or at all) increased.  Starting with the state-sponsored massive [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]] following the assassination of [[Russian history, 1855-1892|Tsar Alexander II]], through the bloody pogroms of 1903 to 1906 who left thousands of Jews dead and many more wounded, continuing with the [[Dreyfus Affair]]  in [[France]] in 1894, Jews were profoundly shocked to see the continuing extent of [[anti-Semitism]] from Russia to France, a country which they thought of as the home of enlightenment and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Robert. ''The Revolution of 1905 in Odessa: Blood on the Steps''. 1993, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the first, [[Judah Leib Pinsker]] published the pamphlet [[Auto-Emancipation]] on January 1, 1882.  The pamphlet became influential for the ''Political Zionism'' movement. The movement was to achieve momentum under the leadership of an Austrian-Jewish journalist, [[Theodor Herzl]], who published his pamphlet ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' ("The Jewish State") in 1896. Prior to the Dreyfus Affair, Herzl had been an assimilationist, but after seeing how France treated its loyal Jewish subjects, he proposed building a separate Jewish state. In 1897 Herzl organized the [[First Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], which founded the [[World Zionist Organisation]] (WZO) and elected Herzl as its first President.  After the state's establishment Zionism, in its various forms, would become the largest Jewish political movement, although more Jews would participate in the national politics of the countries in which they resided.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Folkists==
{{see also|Jewish Autonomism}}
In the aftermath of the 1905 pogroms in Russia, the historian [[Simon Dubnow]] founded the [[Folkspartei]] (Yiddishe Folkspartay) which had some intellectual audience in Russia, then, in independent [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] in the 1920–1930s where it was represented as well in the Parliaments ([[Sejm]], [[Seimas]]) as in numerous municipal councils (incl. [[Warsaw]]) till in the late 1930s. The party did not survive the Shoah, the Holocaust.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Territorialists==
{{main|Jewish Territorialist Organization}}
The territorialists, who had split from the Zionists after the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905, called for creation of a sufficiently large and compact Jewish territory (or territories), not necessarily in the [[Land of Israel]] and not necessarily fully autonomous. Some territorialist leaders, such as [[Nachman Syrkin]], supported the [[Socialism|Socialist]] versions of [[Zionism]], while some others, such as [[Lucien Wolf]], actively opposed [[Zionism]] and promoted anti-nationalist ideas. [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]], one of the founders of the [[Freeland League]], held anti-authoritarian socialist views, as well as his close friend [[Erich Fromm]], who supported Steinberg's territorialist ideas.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Anarchists==
{{main|Jewish Anarchism}}
While the Jews in general played an important role in the international anarchist movements, many Jewish anarchists actively promoted [[Yiddish]] language and culture, focused on specifically Jewish issues. While most Jewish anarchists were irreligious or even vehemently anti-religious, some Jewish anarchist and anti-authoritarian thinkers, such as [[Martin Buber]], rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]] and [[Gustav Landauer]], were religious or religiously inclined and often referred to the Torah, Talmud and other traditional Judaic sources, claiming that anarchist ideas are deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition. The Jewish anarchists believe that in the stateless, free and diverse anarchist society the Jews would have more opportunities to express their individual and cultural autonomy. Many Jewish anarchists, while promoting universal [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] values, had actively participated in the development of the Yiddish culture and Jewish community life. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There was some intersection between the Jewish anarchist, [[Folkism|Folkist]] and [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|Territorialist]] movements. For example, [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]], a renowned Territorialist leader, held anarchist views. Most Jewish anarchists supported [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[communist anarchism]], while a few were individualist anarchists. The small contemporary [[Anarchism in Israel|anarchist movement in Israel]] is very active in [[Israeli peace camp|peace]] and Palestinian solidarity actions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Modern Jewish political movements==
Zionism continues to be the central trans-national political movement of most Jews, although it has split into a variety of branches and philosophies that span the political spectrum from left-wing to right-wing.  Jews are also active in government in many of the countries in which they live, as well as in Jewish community organizations that often take political positions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===In Israel===
{{main|Politics of Israel}}
{{see also|List of political parties in Israel}}

===Outside Israel===
In the 20th century, Jews in Europe and the Americas traditionally tended towards the [[left-wing politics|political left]], and played key roles in the birth of the [[labor movement]] as well as [[socialism]].  While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the [[conservatism|conservative]] side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] more consistently than many other elements of the [[right-wing politics|political right]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Daniel J. Elazar connects this pluralist tendency to the fact that Jews are not expected to proselytize, and argues that whereas [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] anticipate a single world-state, Judaism does not.[http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/jud-democ.htm]  This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in their countries, and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed for over 2,000 years. ''(See [[List of Jews#Politics|list of Jews in politics]], which illustrates the diversity of Jewish political thought and of the roles Jews have played in politics.)''

There are also a number of Jewish secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels.  These organizations often play an important part in the Jewish community.  Most of the largest groups, such as [[Hadassah]] and the [http://www.ujc.org/ United Jewish Communities], have an elected leadership.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular [[United Jewish Communities]] (UJC), formerly known as the [[United Jewish Appeal]] (UJA), represents over 150 [[Jewish Federations]] and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local "Jewish Federation", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] and [[humanitarian]] causes in North America and Israel. Other organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], Zionist Organization of America, Americans for a safe Israel, [[B'nai B'rith]] and [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]] represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The 21st century has brought changes in the political leanings of Jewish communities in the diaspora. In the U.S. and Canada, the two largest Jewish diaspora communities, voters are shifting from liberal to more conservative leanings. in 2011 an Ipsos Reid exit poll of voters in the federal election of Canada found that 52 per cent of Jewish voters supported the Conservatives, 24 per cent the Liberals and 16 per cent the NDP, reflecting " an enormous shift in voter preference among Canadian Jews." The shift appears to reflect an alignment with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition government and its views on Israel’s security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/how-the-political-shift-among-jewish-voters-plays-in-canada/article4199522/ How the political shift among Jewish voters plays in Canada], The Globe and Mail, 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community in Great Britain is also leaning conservative in the 21st century as a poll published by the Jewish Chronicle in early 2015 shows. Of British Jews polled, 69% would vote for the Conservative Party, while 22% would vote for the Labour Party.  This is in stark contrast to the rest of the voter population, which according to a BBC poll had Conservatives and Labor almost tied at about a third each. Jews have typically been a part of the British middle class, traditional home of the Conservative Party, though the number of Jews in working class communities of London is in decline. The main voting bloc of poorer Jews in Britain now, made up primarily of ultra-Orthodox, votes "en masse" for the Conservatives. Attitudes toward [[Israel]] influence the vote of three out of four of British Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/133505/huge-majority-british-jews-will-vote-tory-jc-poll-reveals Huge majority of British Jews will vote Tory, JC poll reveals] The JC.com, 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/218262/how-ed-miliband-lost-britains-jewish-voters/ How Ed Miliband Lost Britain's Jewish Voters] The Jewish Daily Forward, 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Leo Mechelin 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Leo Mechelin]]
'''Leopold (Leo) Henrik Stanislaus Mechelin''' (24 November 1839 in [[Hamina]], Finland – 26 January 1914 in [[Helsinki]], Finland) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] professor, statesman, senator and [[Liberalism|liberal]] reformer. A leading defender of the [[autonomy]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], and of the rights of women and minorities, Mechelin's 1905–1908 government
("Mechelin's Senate") made Finland the first nation in the world with the [[Universal suffrage|universal right to vote]] and to be elected. During his period in office the freedom of [[freedom of expression|expression]], the [[freedom of press|press]], and of [[freedom of assembly|assembly]] were introduced.

==Career==
He also founded the [[Liberal Party of Finland]] (1880–1885), wrote its program, was one of the founders of the Union Bank of Finland 1862 (now part of Nordea Bank) and co-founded the [[Nokia|Nokia Company]] (1871) with [[Fredrik Idestam]], was the first chairman of the [[town council]] of [[Helsinki]] (1875–1876 and 1892–1899) and an internationally respected expert on politology and member of peace movement. Emperor Alexander II ennobled Mechelin 1876.

Mechelin led the passive resistance in Finland during the [[Russification of Finland|first period of oppression]] (1899–1905) until and even after his banishment (1903), from which officials had to let him return as a member of parliament (House of Nobles) 1904, welcomed by a celebrating crowd of 10,000 people. In a secret meeting of the [[Kagaali]], Mechelin had written a petition against the draft of Finns to the Russian army, which collected almost 500,000 signatures. His coalition, the Constitutionals, managed to end the draft through boycott.

==Biography==
[[File:Leo Mechelin Bust.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Leo Mechelin's bust in [[Helsinki]].]]
Born in [[Hamina]] in 1839, the son of Gustaf Johan Mechelin and Amanda Gustava Costiander, Leo Mechelin studied at the [[University of Helsinki]], gaining his [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degree's in [[Philosophy]] in 1860, a bachelor's degree in law in 1864, and a [[Licentiate (degree)|License]] and [[Doctorate]] in 1873.

As professor of jurisdiction and politology 1874-82, Mechelin had argued that the tsars were bound by the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772|old constitutional laws]] from the time of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] rule of Finland (before 1809), and hence affirmed that Finland was a separate, constitutional state, which the tsar could only rule by law, whereas in Russia he had absolute power. During the periods of oppression, the tsar tried to impose unconstitutional laws, which Mechelin opposed. The [[Russian Revolution of 1905|unrests in Russia]] and [[Finnish general strike of 1905|Finland]] (1905) finally compelled the tsar to comply with the [[November Manifesto]] written by Mechelin. This allowed Mechelin to form a government (1905–1908) and to transform Finland into what was in many respects the first [[liberal democracy]] (e.g., in [[New Zealand]] women already had the right to vote but not to be voted; in [[Australia]] only white people had those rights) in 1906. In 1907, the first universal elections to the one-chamber [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] ("eduskunta") were held, and 19 of its 200 first members were women. However, the constitutionals of all parties did not obtain the majority of seats, and the tsar realised that he could carry on with the oppression, starting the [[Russification of Finland|second period of oppression]] (1908–1917). After Mechelin's death (in 1914), the two revolutions in Russia allowed  Finland to declare its independence (1917) and Mechelin's younger co-workers were able to complete his work.

[[Nokia]], once a world-leading [[mobile phone]] corporation, was founded by Mechelin and his student days' roommate [[Fredrik Idestam]] as a [[forestry]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=HugmyrqibtwC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=leo+mechelin+and+nokia&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit75W7ydbVAhXGWBQKHe7YDoYQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=leo%20mechelin%20and%20nokia&amp;f=false|title=Wireless Horizon: Strategy and Competition in the Worldwide Mobile Marketplace|last=Steinbock|first=Dan|date=2003|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=9780814407141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mechelin's wish to expand into the electricity business was at first thwarted by Idestam's opposition, but Mechelin managed to convince most shareholders of his plans and became the company chairman (1898–1914), thus being able to realise his visions.

Mechelin was also active in [[civil society]] and President of the current [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] and of the [[Finnish Art Society]]. As a politician he was always highly respected among all parties and citizens, although after the dissolution of the Liberal Party (1885) he never joined any other party.

Mechelin demanded peaceful [[nonviolent resistance]] and did not bend even during hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/3553 | title = Mechelin, Leo (1839 - 1914) | author = Tapio Helen | date = 1997-09-16 | publisher = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liberal conservatism''' is a [[list of political ideologies|political ideology]] combining [[conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on ethical and social issues, or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} It is a political position which also supports [[civil liberties]] along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions and is usually regarded as a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] ideology. In [[western Europe]], especially [[northern Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and has also adopted some [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] positions.

==Overview, definitions and usage==
As both "conservatism" and "liberalism" have had different meanings over time and across countries, the term "liberal conservatism" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[conservatism]], which rejects the principle of equality as something in discordance with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and the United States), the term "liberal conservatism" came to be understood simply as "conservatism" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical liberal values to call themselves "[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112&lt;/ref&gt; However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a "hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the term "liberal conservatism" is not used. American "[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]" happens to be quite different from the [[Liberalism in Europe|European brand]] and occupies the [[center-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] and [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those conservatives who have embraced [[national conservatism|national conservative]] views, more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stances and/or outright [[populism]], let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. Several regional characteristics can be observed:

* In much of [[central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries as well as Britain and [[Belgium]], a divide persists between liberals on the centre and conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) further to their right.
* On the other hand, in countries strongly influenced by French political culture, such as Spain, Italy or Greece, economic liberalism was originally adopted in the 1830s by social conservatives; as a result, the 'niche' of liberalism is split between two distinct traditions:  'liberalism' itself is considered a centre-right, conservative philosophy, distinct from the centre-left political tradition of social-democratic and humanist liberalism known as Radicalism.

Often liberalism therefore involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. Compared to other [[centre-right politics|centre-right politic]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;al traditions, such as those proposed by Christian democrats, liberal conservatism is less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] economically, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy. In the modern European discourse, "liberal conservatism" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and environmentalism. In this sense, "liberal conservatism" has been espoused for instance by [[nordic countries|Nordic]] conservative parties (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have seen right-wing populist parties emerge to their right and do not comprise Christian democrats who form separate parties and the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[David Cameron]], who in an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010 said that he had always described himself as a "liberal conservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first speech to a Conservative Party's conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of "grand schemes to remake the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm "Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference"], BBC, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]
Historically, in the 18th and 19th centuries "[[conservatism]]" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous "[[liberalism]]" – now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] – advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].

[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]
According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is "economics is prior to politics".&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, Sandoff, "Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism." ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435–464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of current liberal conservatism as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] and the ideological outlook of centre-right parties. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] – without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term "liberal" is used to describe those with free market economic views.

To take land values for public purposes is not really to impose a tax, but to take for public purposes a value created by the community. And out of the fund which would thus accrue from the common property, we might, without degradation to anybody, provide enough to actually secure from want all who were deprived of their natural protectors or met with accident, or any man who should grow so old that he could not work. All prating that is heard from some quarters about its hurting the common people to give them what they do not work for is humbug. The truth is, that anything that injures self-respect, degrades, does harm; but if you give it as a right, as something to which every citizen is entitled to, it does not degrade.

'''Monarchism''' is a movement that supports the [[monarchy]] as a form of [[government]].

{{Monarchism |expanded=all}}

==Ancient kingdoms and royal dynasties==

A monarch is the person at the head of a monarchy. This is a form of [[government]] in which a [[Sovereign state]] or country is ruled or controlled by an individual who typically inherits the throne by birth and rules for life or until abdication. Monarchs may be autocrats (absolute monarchy) or ceremonial heads of state who exercise the power, with actual authority vested in a [[parliament]] or other body (constitutional monarchy).

Monarchism is a system based on the belief that political power should be concentrated in one person who rules by [[decree]]. A monarchist is an individual who supports this form of government, independent from the person, the monarch.

This is a list of [[scandal]]s or controversies whose names include a "-gate" suffix, by analogy with the [[Watergate scandal]], as well as other incidents to which the suffix has (often facetiously) been applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://public.oed.com/blog/the-gate-suffix/ |title=Oxford English Dictionary |chapter=-gate, suffix |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list also includes controversies that are widely referred to with a "-gate" suffix, but may be referred to by another more common name (such as the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal]]). Use of the "-gate" suffix has spread beyond U.S. English to many other countries and languages.

== Etymology, usage, and history of ''-gate'' ==

The [[suffix]] ''[[wikt:-gate|-gate]]'' derives from the Watergate scandal of the United States in the early 1970s, which resulted in the resignation of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;"-gate, comb. form." OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2015. Web. June 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal was named after the [[Watergate complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; the complex itself was named after the "Water Gate" area where [[symphony orchestra]] concerts were staged on the [[Potomac River]] between 1935 and 1965.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPostAnswerManWaterGate&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60120-2004Dec12.html|title=Answer Man: A Gate to Summers Past|author=John Kelly|work=The Washington Post|date=December 13, 2004|accessdate=September 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jsdEHs1g?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60120-2004Dec12.html|archivedate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix is used to embellish a noun or name to suggest the existence of a [[Conspiracy (criminal)|far-reaching scandal]], particularly in [[politics]] and [[government]]. As a [[CBC News]] column noted in 2001, the term may "suggest unethical behaviour and a [[cover-up]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I|last=Partridge|first=Eric|page=844|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-25937-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such usages have been criticised by commentators as [[cliché]]d and misleading;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-06-16/watergate-scandal-changed-political-landscape/55639974/1|title=Watergate scandal changed the political landscape forever|work=USA Today|date=June 16, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Stanyer comments that "revelations are given the 'gate' suffix to add a thin veil of credibility, following 'Watergate', but most bear no resemblance to the painstaking investigation of that particular piece of presidential [[corruption]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanyer|first=James|title=Modern political communication: mediated politics in uncertain times|page=59|publisher=Polity|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-2797-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanyer links the widespread use of ''-gate'' to what the sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]] calls "scandal syndrome":

{{quote|[A] self-reproducing and self-reinforcing process, driven on by competitive and combative struggles in the media and political fields and giving rise to more and more scandals which increasingly become the focus of mediated forms of public debate, marginalizing or displacing other issues and producing on occasion a climate of political crisis which can debilitate or even paralyse a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=John|authorlink=John Thompson (sociologist)|title=Political scandal: power and visibility in the media age|page=265|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7456-2550-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The adoption of ''-gate'' to suggest the existence of a scandal was promoted by [[William Safire]], the conservative ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist and former Nixon administration speechwriter. As early as September 1974 he wrote of "Vietgate", a proposed [[Nixon pardon|pardon of the Watergate criminals]] and [[Vietnam War]] [[draft dodger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=Watergate in American memory: how we remember, forget, and reconstruct the past|page=151|publisher=Basic Books|year=1993|isbn=978-0-465-09083-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he coined numerous ''-gate'' terms, including ''Billygate, Briefingate, Contragate, Deavergate, Debategate, Doublebillingsgate'' (of which he later said "My best [-gate coinage] was the encapsulation of a minor ... scandal as doublebillingsgate"), ''Frankiegate, Franklingate, Genschergate, Housegate, Iraqgate, Koreagate, Lancegate, Maggiegate, Nannygate, Raidergate, Scalpgate, Travelgate, Troopergate'' and ''Whitewatergate''. The ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine suggested that his aim in doing so was "rehabilitating Nixon by relentlessly tarring his successors with the same rhetorical brush – diminished [[guilt by association]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Smoking Lexicon|last=Cohen|first=Noam|work=New York Magazine|page=13|date=February 5, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safire himself later said to author [[Eric Alterman]] that he "may have been seeking to minimize the relative importance of the crimes committed by his former boss with this silliness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sound and fury: the making of the punditocracy|page=79|last=Alterman|first=Eric|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8639-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage has spread into languages other than English; examples of ''-gate'' being used to refer to local political scandals have been reported from [[Argentina]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]], [[Hungary]], [[Greece]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph |first=Brian D. |editor-last1=Spencer |editor-first1=Andrew |editor-last2=Zwicky |editor-first2=Arnold M.|title=The handbook of morphology|page=361|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|chapter=Diachronic Morphology|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-22694-9}} He cites:

The use of a suffix in this way is not new. ''-mandering'' has long been used as a suffix by a politician's name in analogy with [[Gerrymandering#Etymology|gerrymandering]] ([[Andrew Johnson#Congressman (1843–1853)|"Henry-mandering" was used in 1852]]). In recent years, the ''-gate'' suffix as a catch-all signifier for scandal has seen some competition from {{nowrap|''-ghazi'',}} as in "Ballghazi" instead of "[[Deflategate]]", or "Bridgeghazi" instead of "[[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|Bridgegate]]".  The use of ''-ghazi'' is a play on the [[investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack]], which despite numerous official investigations into the possibility of government cover-ups, has resulted in no criminal charges or major repercussions for the individuals supposedly involved.  ''-ghazi'' may be seen as carrying an ironic or self-effacing connotation in its usage, implying that the event described has the appearance and media coverage of a scandal, but does not actually amount to much in a grander sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DeflateGate ... or Ballghazi? Will the new scandal suffix have staying power|last=Farhi|first=Paul|work=The Washington Post|date=January 27, 2015|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/deflategate--or-ballghazi-will-the-new-scandal-suffix-have-staying-power/2015/01/27/db1c5eac-a571-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation also revealed that head coach [[Sean Payton]] knew about the scheme but took no steps to stop it. NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] handed out multiple suspensions to coaches and players involved in the scheme.

| [[Deflategate]] || 2015 || After the [[2014–15 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship Game: New England Patriots 45, Indianapolis Colts 7|2015 AFC Championship game]], the [[National Football League|NFL]] acknowledged it was investigating reports that the game balls had been deflated. One report may have come from [[Indianapolis Colts]] player [[D'Qwell Jackson]] after he intercepted a pass by [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Tom Brady]]. Patriots coach [[Bill Belichick]] stated he knew nothing of the reports until the morning following the game, and that he and the team would "cooperate fully" with any investigation.  Brady called the allegation "ridiculous". On January 20, sources reported that 11 of 12 footballs provided by the Patriots were underinflated. On May 11, 2015, the NFL announced it had suspended [[Tom Brady]] without pay for 4 games of the [[2015 NFL season|upcoming season]]. The Patriots were fined $1 million and lost their first-round pick in the [[2016 NFL Draft]] and their fourth-round pick in the [[2017 NFL Draft]]. In September 2015 a federal judge overturned the suspension, allowing Brady to play the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]].

It was later revealed that French judge [[Marie-Reine Le Gougne]] had been pressured by [[Didier Gailhaguet]], the head of the French skating federation into voting for the Russians in the pairs competition in exchange for the Russians voting for the French team in the ice dance competition.  As a result, Le Gougne was suspended by the ISU for 3 years and her marks for the long program were thrown out, resulting in a 4–4 split decision.  The IOC then decided to upgrade the Canadians' silver to gold, and a second medal ceremony was held with both the Russian and Canadian pairs attending. || &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3027011/Judge-suspended-after-Skategate-scandal.html|title=Judge suspended after 'Skategate' scandal|date=May 1, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=September 19, 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Driv3rgate]]
|2004
|Before the worldwide release of ''[[Driver 3]]'', Atari offered the magazines ''[[PSM3|PSM2]]'' and ''[[Xbox World]]'' early review copies of the game in exchange for positive review scores. This deal was taken by both of them, yet, due to the disappointing nature of the game when it was released, gamers took to forums to complain about the mysterious circumstances related to why both magazines gave positive scores for a heavily berated game. Many then figured out that Atari had paid both, and as a response the comments were systematically wiped by administrators, which gave way to suggestions of a cover up by the publishing house. This controversy would later be referred to as "DRIV3Rgate" and the affair gained a fairly large amount of coverage in the games press and on Internet forums. During this time, Atari hired a guerrilla team to, in desperation, repeatedly make new accounts and post positive threads and comments about the game in an attempt to reduce the controversy.

|Refers to the controversy following the November 2007 dismissal of [[Jeff Gerstmann]] from his position as Editorial Director of [[GameSpot]]. Gerstmann had awarded a ''Fair'' rating to the game ''[[Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men]]'' at a time when the game was being heavily advertised on GameSpot, which led to accusations from many games journalists of a lack of editorial integrity on the part of GameSpot, who denied that the review had been a part of the reasoning behind the dismissal. However, a subsequent interview with Gerstmann in 2012 countered this statement, with Gerstmann claiming that, although there was more to his firing than any single review, it would not be untrue to say that the Kane &amp; Lynch episode contributed to it.

{{Political anthropology|Studies}}

'''''Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali''''' is a 1980 book written by [[anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geertz argues that the pre-colonial Balinese state was not a "[[Hydraulic empire|hydraulic bureaucracy]]" nor an [[oriental despotism]], but rather, an organized spectacle. The noble rulers of the island were less interested in administering the lives of the Balinese than in dramatizing their rank and hence political superiority through large public rituals and ceremonies. These cultural processes did not support the state, he argues, but ''were'' the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=13–17, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps most clear in what was, after all, the master image of political life: kingship. The whole of the negara - court life, the traditions that organized it, the extractions that supported it, the privileges that accompanied it - was essentially directed toward defining what power was; and what power was what kings were. Particular kings came and went, 'poor passing facts' anonymized in titles, immobilized in ritual, and annihilated in bonfires. But what they represented, the model-and-copy conception of order, remained unaltered, at least over the period we know much about. The driving aim of higher politics was to construct a state by constructing a king. The more consummate the king, the more exemplary the centre. The more exemplary the centre, the more actual the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geertz used the Balinese case to develop an abstract model of the [[Theatre state]] applicable to all the South East Asian Indic polities. To succinctly summarize his theory, "Power served pomp, not pomp power." Other anthropologists have contested the ahistorical, static nature of the model. They point out that he has depoliticized a political institution by emphasizing culture while ignoring its material base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=393–413|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Clifford Geertz was an American anthropologist who is remembered for his influence on the practice of [[symbolic anthropology]], and who was considered "for three decades...the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford, Shweder, R. A., &amp; Good, B. (2005). Clifford Geertz by his colleagues. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geertz used this model to provide "an alternate conception of what politics is about"; to advance an approach to history as a succession of broad cultural schemata; and to contribute to the cultural dimension of the discussion on Southeast Asian polities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=398|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is a consideration of many elements of Balinese life, such as cremation ceremonies, that many would not consider a part of a state apparatus. In order to understand why cremation ceremonies should be so key to the "Theatre state" Geertz provides a detailed description of Balinese social organization [[Ethnography|in its own cultural terms]]. Particular aspects of Balinese life have been over-emphasized, according to some, to accommodate his model. Those aspects focus, in particular, on the role of irrigation.

===The Ruling Class===
For most of the nineteenth century, there were seven principal kingdoms, of which Klungkung was considered the oldest and most sacred. The others were Tabanan, Badung, Gianyar, Karengasem, Bangli, and Mengwi. They were primarily located on the plain on the south side of the island. Each of the kingdoms  controlled a riverine valley and hence the water supply required for rice irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdoms of Bali were said to have been founded by Javanese refugees from the Hinduized kingdom of [[Majapahit]] which had just fallen to Muslim invaders. They, in turn, invaded in 1352 at Gelgel and established an Indic state based upon the caste system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The caste system====
The caste system only loosely resembled the caste system in India. The three noble castes were referred to as "''triwangsa''," (three peoples), the "insiders" (''wong jero'') as opposed to the commoners (''wong jaba'', outsiders).&lt;ref name="Geertz-p26-27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacRae argues that this emphasis on the Indic heritage of Bali is overdrawn, and points out that Geertz himself admits that caste is a misnomer in Bali, and "that the Indic surface  of Balinese political institutions has acted to inhibit a comparative reference eastwards... towards the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|page=398|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dadia====
The basic unit of the triwangsa castes was the "noble house" or dadia. The commoners, for the most part, lacked these corporate kin groups.&lt;ref name="Geertz-p26-27" /&gt; The dadia was a kinship group whose leadership passed through the line of the eldest male, from father to son. Younger sons remained identified with the group, lived nearby, but had less status. The children of the core line also had more status than the children of the junior lines. Geertz refers to this as the principle of "sinking status." Each of these junior lines could potentially sever itself and form an independent dadia. This process of schism formed the internal politics within the royal houses, as distinct from political conflict between houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status differentials both within and between houses made patron-client relations the basic idiom of politics. These client relationships were especially important between castes, linking the priestly caste (''padanda'') with noble houses in a teacher-disciple tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these patron-client ties within dadia, alliances also formed between dadia in different kingdoms. These alliances were frequently codified in treaties, although the issues they covered seemed "designed more to codify the pretexts upon which alliances could be broken than to establish the bases upon which they could be built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Village and the State===
[[File:Bali temple diagram.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of a Balinese temple]]
[[File:PuraDalemSidan.jpg|thumbnail|Pura Dalem Sidan (temple)]]

The Balinese ruling classes seemed fragmented, internally torn by intrigues within dadia, and weakly allied between kingdoms. This poor political integration was aggravated by the political independence of the villages under royal dadia rule. The Balinese state was composed of institutions that cross-cut villages. Villages were not independent, self-contained "village republics" but were cross-cut by membership in three separate locally based political institutions that organized local life: the hamlet (''banjar''), the irrigation society (''subak''), and the temple congregation (''pemaksan''). Villages were also crosscut by tax obligations to different lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The village (''banjar'')====
The Balinese village has been falsely described in the colonial literature as a "village republic", bounded, self-contained and wholly autonomous. According to Geertz, an important part of this book was to disrupt colonial images of the closed corporate village. Geertz emphasizes that the village controlled only certain aspects of the everyday life of Balinese villagers, and that the tax and temple systems cross-cut village membership. That is, the members of a single village might pay taxes through several ''perbekel'' and be part of different temple congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village did have a constitution, which spelled out its members responsibilities for road making, upkeep of public facilities, night watch, and settlement of civil disputes. The village had its own leadership (''klian banjar''). This range of duties led Geertz to conclude "In brief, perhaps the bulk (though as we shall see, far from the whole) of Balinese government, in the strict sense of authoritative regulation of social life, was carried out by the hamlet, leaving the state free to dramatize power rather than to administer it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The temple congregation (''pemaksan'')====
Although focused on religious rites, the pemaksan was a corporate public body that was also an agency of government because of the link between religion and custom, i.e. forms of worship and social behaviour in Bali. Such religious rites were considered "adat" (custom), "the entire framework of social action in which both men and gods are enclosed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of small variations in adat defined the boundaries between pemaksan. The pemaksan thus stands as the moral community, next to the civil community embodied in the hamlet and the economic community in the irrigation society. The pemaksan will draw on one to ten villages for its members.

The pemaksan will maintain the "Three Great Temples" (''Kahyangan Tiga''): 1) the Origin Temple (''Pura Puseh'') which commemorates the human settlement of the area. 2) The Death Temple (''Pura Dalem'') used to pacify the not yet cremated and hence dangerous dead. And 3) the Great Council Temple (''Pura Balai Agung'') for ensuring the overall fertility of the pemaksan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irrigation system (''Subak'')====
[[File:1 Tegalalang rice terrace ubud bali.jpg|left|thumb|[[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system]]

According to Geertz, one of the most important of state institutions in Bali is the irrigation society (''subak'') given the theoretical emphasis placed upon irrigation in the materialist models of the "[[Asiatic mode of production]]." These models viewed the control of irrigation by lords as the major means of also controlling the population that depended on those irrigation works for their sustenance. Geertz views the subak as an autonomous organization separate from the state, much like the banjar. The system of dams, dikes and canals were the property of the subak, and hence controlled by the farmers themselves. Geertz thus dismisses any notion of "primitive communism" - and its spectre, "state capitalism."&lt;ref name="Geertz-p69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subak controls the water flowing from a single up-river dam. The water flows through its rice terraces to other subaks farther downstream. Once water flowed into a subak it was divided through a series of weirs so that each farmer would get the amount of water they needed at the right time. The regulation of water is thus a serious issue, and encounters regular bottlenecks where control of the supply for a whole subak can be seized. Controlling the complex flow of water within a subak was accomplished through a highly regimented series of rituals. Water temples placed at points of water division would coordinate the flow of water through carefully timed rituals. Geertz emphasizes that there is no central control of the timing of these rituals, and hence that the state is not an "oriental despotism" controlling the population through the control of water.&lt;ref name="Geertz-p69" /&gt;

[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Balinese rice terraces is part of Subak irrigation system.]]

It is Geertz's characterization of the irrigation system as headless that has attracted critique. Stephen Lansing's examination of Balinese irrigation shows that the need for effective water management links thousands of farmers in clear hierarchies, beginning with the most sacred temples dedicated to the Goddess of the volcanic Crater Lake ([[Mount Agung]]) that all Balinese hold sacred, and descending into the plains and low-lying rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansing|first=Stephen|title=Priests and Programmers: technologies of power in the engineered landscape of Bali|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on nineteenth century Balinese records, Brigitta Hauser-Schaublin has shown that regional lords and kings played a large role in managing irrigation, and that this role was lost only in the Dutch colonial period. She argues that Geertz's failure to see the larger state role in water management reflects this change in colonial practice, thereby weakening the "theatre state" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser-Schaublin|first=Brigitta|title=Temple and King: Resource Management, Rituals and Redistribution in Early Bali |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|year=2005|volume=11|issue=4|pages=747–71|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2005.00260.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Perbekel system ====
The free, land-owning ''kawulas'' made up 90% of the population. Kawulas were attached to a perbekel, a "political foreman" to whom they owed specific obligations and taxes. The perbekels were attached to punggawas, the lords of dadia. Unlike the village, none of these political roles was based upon territorial residence. In other words, membership in the village was cross-cut by obligations to different perbekels and their lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bali was thus not a feudal realm where lords controlled land and people within a fiefdom. Lords and kawulas owned their own land, and lords did not generally seek their kawulas as tenants on their land. Kawulas had only two obligations to their perbekels: ritual service and military support: "He was a stagehand, spear carrier, and [[claqueur]] in an endless political opera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Although Bali lies along major Indonesian trade roots in the north, its mountainous geography orients it to the south; its only navigable port was at Kuta, on a southern peninsula. The bulk of trade remained in foreign hands, including the Chinese, [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis|Buginese]] and Europeans. Foreigners were largely restricted to these insulated ports of trade. Trade within Bali occurred in rotating markets characterized by traditional fixed exchange rates. Goods and services were also circulated through large scale [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistributive]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of international trade was leased out by the king to a ''subandar'' (harbour master), who served as an intermediary between the traders and the dadia of the royal house, to whom he paid the rent. This rent was paid to each Lord of the royal house whenever they held a ceremony. The more ceremonies held, the greater share a Lord would receive of the spoils of trade. The point of trade then, was to hold larger spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectacle and political power===
[[File:Ubud Cremation 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|Balinese Cremation tower]]

Geertz argues that state ceremonials in the Negara were "metaphysical theatre"; that is, theatre designed to express a vision of the ultimate nature of reality that at the same time tried to shape current conditions to match that reality. Ritual events all re-created social relations of jero ("inner", to whom one surrendered power in the ritual event thereby making them powerful) and jaba ("outer", a provider of services to those who are jero) between lords and their kawula. Every ritual performance reproduced jero-jaba relations as both symbolic ideal and pragmatic reality, thereby reinforcing social order. Thus, although the state was cross-cut by the conflicting jurisdictions of temples, hamlets, and irrigation societies, they all come together  for mass state rituals in which the ideal social order of the state is made real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of the cremation ceremony====
The cremation ceremony was the largest and most ostentatious of the state rituals, attended by all the political dependants of a lord. At the centre of the ritual was the cremation tower (badé) on which the body of the deceased lord rested in state until the whole was consumed in fire. The cremation tower itself symbolized the cosmic order the ritual sought to make real. At its base were the world of demons (winged serpents), above which stood a platform called the House, representing the world of man. Above that were the tiers of roofs symbolizing the world of the gods, to which the deceased was ascending; a commoner would ascend to the first heaven (1 tier), whereas a king to the eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While having an eleven storey tower was iconic of regal status, accomplishing a cremation ritual was an accomplishment - a struggle - that justified that status. The first part of the ceremony, for example, involved transporting the tower in a procession to the cremation ground, a mob scene involving thousands; some of these carried the bier forward, while others tried to stop it. The struggle could potentially prevent those who lacked the status and resources from making what others felt were false claims; the scene "was a bit like a playful riot - a deliberated, even studied, violence, designed to set off a no less deliberated and even more studied stillness, which the variously imperturbable priests, agnates, widows and tributary dead contrived to gather about the central tower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=118–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and critique of the book==
[[File:Southeast Asian Historical Mandalas.svg|thumb|right|Notable mandala states in [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian history]] (circa 5th to 15th century). From north to south; [[Pagan Kingdom|Bagan]], [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Champa]], [[Khmer empire|Angkor]], [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]].]]
Although Geertz considered this the pinnacle of his thinking on politics and history, reactions to the book have been mixed, "combining admiration for its scope and ambition with scepticism about its claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=394|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of the scepticism is that the book is clearly not a history of a specific polity, but a generalized ideal-type model intended to guide representations of the Southeast Asian Indic states found in [[Bali]], [[Java]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]] in the fifth to fifteenth centuries. As such, it is one of several models, such as that of O.W. Wolters "[[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]]" model, or [[Stanley Tambiah]]'s model of the "Galactic polity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Tony|title=Fluid Iron: State formation in Southeast Asia|year=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geertz made it clear that his emphasis was a general model of the "theatre state" and not a specific Balinese kingdom by referring to the Balinese state with the Indic term Negara, whereas the Balinese refer to their pre-colonial state as a ''kerajaan''. As such, it over-estimates the Indic influence on Bali, and under-estimates its similarities with Polynesian kingdoms in [[Tahiti]], [[Samoa]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=398–403|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of the book have focused on:

1) As a culturalist approach to history, it is remarkably static and ahistorical. [[Fredrik Barth]] argued that it "depoliticized" a political institution as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|title=Balinese worlds|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) By subordinating power to culture, the book ignores the material base of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Leo|title=Rice, ideology and the legitimation of hierarchy in Bali|journal=Man|year=1991|volume=26|issue=4|pages=445–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Geertz's book was published, several other historical studies of particular kingdoms have appeared which emphasize the more conventional political economic forms of power underlying the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|page=395|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Geertz makes the ritual aspect of Balinese culture "more exotic, more extraordinary and more other than the evidence warrants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Leo|title=Rice, ideology and the legitimation of hierarchy in Bali|journal=Man|year=1991|volume=26|issue=4|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4) Tambiah notes that Geertz presents the Balinese kings as, at once, the focus of ritual theatre that creates the exemplary centre as a still point, "immobilized into passivity and reflective trances" yet at the same time "Rent by virtually continuous intrigue, dispute, violence and an enormous amount of micro-upheaval."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge MA|pages=320–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his best effort, Geertz does not transcend the break between expressive and instrumental action, or between power as pomp and power as control of people and resources.  He thus leaves himself open to Marxist critiques that view the state as a mystification, an "illusory representation of the unity of the village communities (as Marx put it in his sketch of 'oriental despotism'), and that the ceremonies of state are nothing but the spiritualizing of material interests and the covering up of material conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge MA|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21271">'''New Public Management''' (NPM) is an approach to running [[public service]] organizations that is used in government and public service institutions and agencies, at both sub-national and national levels. The term was first introduced by academics in the UK and Australia &lt;ref&gt;Hood 1991 and Hood and Jackson 1991&lt;/ref&gt; to describe approaches that were developed during the 1980s as part of an effort to make the public service more "businesslike" and to improve its efficiency by using private sector management models. As with the private sector, which focuses on "[[customer service]]", NPM reforms often focused on the "...centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used [[e-government]] consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using [[quasi-market]] structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in [[health care]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key themes in NPM were "...financial control, value for money, increasing efficiency...,identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over.. power to the senior management" [[Senior management|executives]]. Performance was assessed with audits, benchmarks and performance evaluations. Some NPM reforms used private sector companies to deliver what were formerly public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPM advocates in some countries worked to remove "...collective agreements [in favour of]...individual rewards packages at senior levels combined with short term contracts" and introduce private sector-style [[corporate governance]], including using a [[Board of Directors]] approach to strategic guidance for public organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NPM approaches have been used in many countries around the world, NPM is particularly associated with the most industrialized [[OECD]] nations such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States of America]]. NPM advocates focus on using approaches from the private sector–the [[corporation|corporate]] or business world–which can be successfully applied in the public sector and in a [[public administration]] context. NPM approaches have been used to reform the public sector, its policies and its programs. NPM advocates claim that it is a more efficient and effective means of attaining the same outcome. 

In NPM, citizens are viewed as "customers" and public servants are viewed as public managers. NPM tries to realign the relationship between public service managers and their political superiors by making a parallel relationship between the two. Under NPM, public managers have incentive-based motivation such as pay-for-performance, and clear performance targets are often set, which are assessed by using [[performance evaluation]]s. As well, managers in an NPM paradigm may have greater discretion and freedom as to how they go about achieving the goals set for them. This NPM approach is contrasted with the traditional [[public administration]] model, in which institutional decision-making, policy-making and public service delivery is guided by regulations, legislation and [[administrative law|administrative procedures]]. 

NPM reforms use approaches such as disaggregation, customer satisfaction initiatives, [[customer service]] efforts, applying an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial spirit]] to public service, and [[innovation|introducing innovations]]. The NPM system allows "the expert manager to have a greater discretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance, and Public Administration|date=Feb 2, 2006|pages=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Public Managers under the New Public Management reforms can provide a range of choices from which customers can choose, including the right to opt out of the service delivery system completely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first practices of New Public Management emerged in the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Thatcher played the functional role of “policy entrepreneur" and the official role of prime minister.{{fact|date=November 2016}} Thatcher drove changes in public management policy in such areas as organizational methods, civil service, labor relations, expenditure planning, financial management, audit, evaluation, and procurement. Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]], kept public management policy on the agenda of the Conservative government, leading to the implementation of the Next Steps Initiative. Major also launched the programs of the Citizens Charter Initiative, Competing for Quality, Resource Accounting and Budgeting, and the Private Finance Initiative.

A term was coined in the late 1980s to denote a new (or renewed) focus on the importance of management and ‘production engineering’ in public service delivery, which often linked to doctrines of economic rationalism (Hood 1989, Pollitt 1993). During this timeframe public management became an active area of policy-making in numerous other countries, notably in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden.  At the same time, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ]] (OECD) established its Public Management Committee and Secretariat (PUMA), conferring to public management the status normally accorded more conventional domains of policy. In the 1990s, public management was a major item on President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]’s agenda. Early policy actions of the Clinton administration included launching the [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government|National Partnership]] and signing into law the [[Government Performance and Results Act]]. Currently there are few indications that public management issues will vanish from governmental policy agendas. A recent study showed that in Italy, municipal directors are aware of a public administration now being oriented toward new public management where they are assessed according to the results they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1093–1115|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Public Management (NPM) expresses the idea that the cumulative flow of policy decisions over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[North America]]. A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.

== Globalization ==
Although the origins of NPM came from Westernized countries it expanded to a variety of other countries in the 1990s. Before the 1990s, NPM was largely associated to an idea utilized by developed countries that are particularly Anglo-Saxon. However the 1990s have seen countries in Africa, Asia and other countries looking into using this method. In Africa, downsizing and decrease of user fees have been widely introduced. These autonomous agencies within the public sectors have been established in these areas. Performance contracting became a common policy in crisis states worldwide. Contracting out of this magnitude can be used to do things such as waste management, cleaning, laundry, catering and road maintenance.

== Aspects  ==

NPM was accepted as the "gold standard for administrative reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management: Theory, Ideology, and Practice|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance and Public Administration|date=Jan 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s. The idea for using this method for government reform was that if the government guided private-sector principles were used rather than rigid hierarchical bureaucracy, it would work more efficiently. NPM promotes a shift from bureaucratic administration to business-like professional management. NPM was cited as the solution for management ills in various organizational context and policy making in education and health care reform.

The basic principles of NPM is can best be described when split into seven different aspects elaborated by Christopher Hood in 1991. Hood also invented the term NPM itself. &lt;ref&gt;in "A Public Management for all seasons?", Public Administration Review, Voæl 69, Spring1991 (3-19).&lt;/ref&gt; They are the following:

=== Management ===
Because of its belief in the importance and strength of privatizing government, it is critical to have an emphasis on management by engaging in hands-on methods. This theory allows leaders the freedom to manage freely and open up discretion.

=== Performance standards ===
Its important to maintain explicit standards and measures of performance in a workforce. Using this method promotes clarification of goals/intent, targets, and indicators for progression.

=== Output controls ===
The third point acknowledges the "shift from the use of input controls and bureaucratic procedures to rules relying on output controls measured by quantitive performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;Yamaoto, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect requires using performance based assessments when looking to outsource work to private companies/groups.

=== Decentralization ===
NPM advocates often shifted from a unified management system to a decentralized system in which managers gain flexibility and are not limited to agency restrictions.

=== Competition ===
This characteristic focuses on how NPM can promote competition in the public sector which could in turn lower cost, eliminate debate and possibly achieve a higher quality of progress/work through the term contacts. Competition can also be found when the government offers contracts to the private sectors and the contract is given in terms of the ability to deliver the service effectively, quality of the goods provided, hence this will increase competition because the other private sector which did not get the contract will make strides to improve the quality and ability thereby facilitating competition.

=== Private-sector management ===
This aspect focuses on the necessity to establish short-term labor contracts, develop corporate plans or [[business plan]]s, performance agreements and [[mission statement]]s. It also focuses on establishing a workplace in which public employees or contractors are aware of the goals and intention that agencies are trying to reach.

=== Cost reduction ===
The most effective one which has led to its ascent into global popularity, focuses on keeping cost low and efficiency high. "Doing more with less" &lt;ref&gt;Hood, 1991: 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;
moreover cost reduction stimulates efficiency and is one way which makes it different from the traditional approach of management&lt;ref&gt;Deffy, 1999:67-78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between public and private sectors ==
New Public Management draws practices from the private sector and uses them in the public sector of management. NPM reforms use market forces to hold the public sector accountable and the satisfaction of preferences as the measures of accountability.  In order for this system to proceed, certain conditions, such as the existence of competition, must exist and information about choices must be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms that promise to reinvent government by way of focusing on results and customer satisfaction as opposed to administrative and political processes fail to account for legislative self-interest. Institutions other than federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinvention would not even be announced, except perhaps on hallway bulletin boards.

== Issues ==

===Criticisms===
There are blurred lines between policymaking and providing services in the New Public Management system. Questions have been raised about the potential politicization of the public service, when executives are hired on contract under pay-for-performance systems.  There are concerns that public managers may move away from trying to meet citizens' needs. NPM brings to question integrity and compliance when dealing with incentives for public managers. Questions such as managers being more or less faithful arise. The public interest is at risk and could undermine the trust in government. Accountability can be a big issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relevance  ====

Although NPM had a dramatic impact in the 1990s on managing and policymaking, many scholars believe that NPM has hit its prime. Scholars like Frank Dunleavy believe New Public Management is phasing out because of disconnect with “customers” and their institutions. Scholars cite the Digital Era and the new importance of technology that kills the necessity of NPM. In countries that are less industrialized the NPM concept is still growing and spreading. This trend has much to do with a country's ability or inability to get their public sector in tune with the Digital Era. New Public Management was created in the Public Sector to create change based on: disaggregation, competition, and incentives. Using incentives to produce the maximum services from an organization is largely stalled in many countries and being reversed because of increased complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
Post-NPM, many countries explored [[digital era governance]] (DEG). Dunleavy believes this new way of governance should be heavily centered upon information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology will help re-integrate with digitalization changes. Digital Era Governance provides a unique opportunity for self- sustainability however, there are various factors that will determine whether or not DEG can be implemented successfully. When countries have proper technology, NPM simply can't compete very well with DEG. DEG does an excellent job of making services more accurate, prompt and remove most barriers and conflicts. DEG also can improve the service quality and provide local access to outsourcers.

===Comparisons to New Public Administration===

New Public Management is often mistakingly compared to [[New Public Administration]]. The ‘New Public Administration’ movement was one established in the USA during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James|title=Public Administration versus The New Public Management|url=http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Book_Chapters/NewPublicMgt.doc.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there may be some common features, the central themes of the two movements are different. The main thrust of the New Public Administration movement was to bring academic public administration into line with a radical egalitarian agenda that was influential in US university campuses. By contrast, the emphasis of the New Public Management movement a decade or so later was firmly managerial in the sense that it stressed the difference that management could and should make the quality and efficiency of public services. It focuses on public service production functions and operational issues contrasted with the focus on public accountability, ‘model employer’ public service values, ‘due process,’ and what happens inside public organizations in conventional public administration. That meant New Public Management doctrines tended to be opposed to egalitarian ideas of managing without managers, juridical doctrines of rigidly rule-bound administration and doctrines of self-government by public-service professionals like teachers and doctors.

[[File:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Is it material composition, or organization of parts, that creates the mutual [[symbiosis]] between [[Amphiprion]] [[clownfish]] and tropical [[sea anemone]]s?]]
'''Organicism''' is the philosophical perspective which views the [[universe]] and its parts as organic wholes and – either by analogy or literally – as living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory that everything in nature has an organic basis or is part of an organic whole" [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be synonymous with [[holism]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Organicism is an important tradition within the history of [[natural philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, the philosophers of the [[Ionian Enlightenment]] were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as ''[[Hylozoism|hylozoists]]'' meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see [[Benjamin Farrington|Farrington]] (1941/53)&lt;/ref&gt; where it has remained as a vital current alongside [[reductionism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], the approaches that have dominated science since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see [[Fritjof Capra|Capra]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] is among the earliest philosophers to have regarded the universe as an intelligent living being (see ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''). Organicism flourished for a period during the era of [[German romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular the writings of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Goethe]]&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the new science of biology was first defined by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Within modern-day [[Biology|biological]] [[sciences]] organicism is the approach that stresses the organization (particularly the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] properties), rather than the composition, of [[organism]]s. [[John Scott Haldane]] was the first biologist to use the term to describe his philosophical views in 1917, after which it was followed by certain other biologists in the 20th century.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and [[reductionism]] (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects [[vitalism]], the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" &gt;Fritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.&lt;ref&gt;What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from [[monism]] (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe)  to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in [[symbolic logic]], in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], or in metaphysics.

[[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. "Holism," the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by "[[holistic medicine]]" and by [[New Age]] Thought. German [[Nazism]] appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet [[Dialectical Materialism]] also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from [[Hegel]] via [[Karl Marx]]'s co-worker [[Friedrich Engels]], again giving a controversial political association to organicism.

Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], Jacques Novicow, [[Albert Schäffle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[René Worms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Barberis, "In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism.

==In biology==

In breathing entities, cells – i.e., the smallest unit of life – were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"biology". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/science/biology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" /&gt; puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from "the parts to the whole" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology.

In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are  a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology]'', Joseph Needham,  Journal of Philosophical Studies''  1928 . Accessed Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are [[Ross Granville Harrison|Ross Harrison]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. [[Donna Haraway]] discusses them in her first book ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields''. [[John Scott Haldane]] (father of [[J. B. S. Haldane]]), [[William Emerson Ritter]], [[E. S. Russell|Edward Stuart Russell]], [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], founder of "Relational Biology" provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. 1991. "Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Columbia University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Biology Club===

In the early 1930s [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] and [[Joseph Needham]], together with [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], Dorothy Needham, and [[Dorothy Wrinch]], formed the [[Theoretical Biology Club]], to promote the organicist approach to [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Organic|last=Peterson|first=Erik|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822944669|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was in opposition to [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[reductionism]] and the [[gene-centric view of evolution]]. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of molecular biology, Michel Morange, Matthew Cobb, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950, Christopher Lawrence, George Weisz, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The future of DNA, Johannes Wirz, Edith T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5433">'''Parity of esteem''' is a concept which can be applied in a variety of contexts.

==As a political philosophy==
Parity of esteem can be used to establish a theory to overcome inter-communal conflict. Promoters of the theory argue that ''"parity of esteem"'' "offers a language for negotiation of a post-conflict equilibrium". This negotiation begins with the communities recognising the stalemate of their position. Rather than continue trying to out-do each other, the communities should attempt to negotiate a peaceful coexistence in a shared physical space despite their cultural differences.

''"Parity of esteem"'' can be described as a [[Age of Enlightenment|post-Enlightenment]] theory as it differs drastically from classical [[Liberalism|liberal]] or [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[rationalism]] and is contrary to 20th-century ideas of "[[self-determination]]" or the 19th-century idea of the [[nation-state]]. Many of these anticipated a "withering away of [[nationalism]]" once minorities were brought within the nation-state. These concepts are today the most dominant within contemporary political theory. As [[Ernest Gellner]] writes, "the idea that political boundaries must be congruent with ethnic ones, that rulers must not be ethnically distinguishable from the ruled now has a salience and authority which it has never possessed in the previous history of mankind". Where Enlightenment theories addressed issues of inter-communal conflict, it did so either by promoting "non-sectarianism" against "tribalism" (liberalism) or emphasising "class politics" against "[[bourgeois nationalism]]" (Marxism). Neither of these approaches recognised the traditions of belligerents in inter-communal conflicts. ''"Parity of esteem"'' on the other hand can accepts various nationalist traditions within one state.

Interest in ''"parity of esteem"'' approaches emerged during the mid-1980s and accelerated following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the early 1990s. It was recognised that while there were 184 independent states, there were more than 600 living [[Language family|language groups]] and more than 5,000 [[ethnic groups]]. Simply put, without enough [[Geo-politics|geo-political space]], slogans such as the Serb nationalist claim for "All Serbs in One State" were simply unworkable. Since the end of the 1990s, ''"Parity of esteem"'' is a core concept to the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].

==Health care==
''"Parity of Esteem for Mental Health"'' is an issue for many [[healthcare system]]s because of the pervasive [[Mental disorder#Stigma and discrimination|stigma of mental illness]]. People with diagnosed mental illness die on average around 20 years earlier than those without such a diagnosis, some because of suicide, but mostly because of poorly treated physical illness. Mental illness has been assessed as constituting around a quarter of the [[disease burden]] in developed countries.  There is much bigger [[Global mental health#Treatment gap|treatment gap]] for mental illness than for physical illness.  

In the USA legislation was enacted in 2006 which attempted to achieve equality in health insurance coverage between surgical treatment and mental health treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parity of Esteem for Mental Health|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-485/POST-PN-485.pdf|accessdate=13 September 2015|issue=485|publisher=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the UK [[Norman Lamb]] campaigned for mental health to be given parity of esteem with physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norfolk MP Norman Lamb defeated by Tim Farron in his bid to lead the LiberalD emocrats|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/norfolk_mp_norman_lamb_defeated_by_tim_farron_in_his_bid_to_lead_the_liberal_democrats_1_4156211|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] proposed that parity of esteem should be defined as "Valuing mental health equally with physical health". In practice most arguments have been centred on levels of funding.  Expenditure on mental health services provided by NHS trusts fell by around 8.25% between 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health trust funding down 8% from 2010 despite coalition’s drive for parity of esteem|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/03/20/mental-health-trust-funding-8-since-2010-despite-coalitions-drive-parity-esteem/|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Community Care|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr Phil Moore chair of the Mental Health Commissioners Network at NHS Clinical Commissioners discussions in 2016 had degenerated into a funding dispute.  He wanted to see discussions about the degree to which mental health is embedded into other services, including the integration of psychological services with general practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal||title=\CCG deputy chair urges commissioners to refocus 'parity of esteeem'talks|journal=Commissioning Review|issue=Summer 2016|pages=36-38|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paternalism''' is action limiting a person's or group's liberty or autonomy which is intended to promote their own good.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Gerald, "Paternalism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2010 Edition)'', Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism can also imply that the behavior is against or regardless of the will of a person, or also that the behavior expresses an attitude of superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Shiffrin, Seana. 2000. "Paternalism, Unconscionability Doctrine, and Accommodation". ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'' 29(3): 205–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism, paternalistic and paternalist have all been used as a [[pejorative]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

The word paternalism is from the Latin ''pater'' "father" via the adjective ''paternus'' "fatherly", which in Medieval Latin became ''paternalis''. Some, such as [[John Stuart Mill]], think paternalism to be appropriate towards children: "It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood."&lt;ref name=Mill1859&gt;Mill, J.S. [1859]/(1991) "On Liberty", published in Gray, John (ed), ''John Stuart Mill: On Liberty and Other Essays'', Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Paternalism towards adults is sometimes thought of as treating them as if they were children.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Joel. 1986. ''Harm to Self''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Soft and hard===
Soft Paternalism is the view that paternalism is justified only if an action to be committed is involuntary. [[John Stuart Mill]] gives the example of a person about to walk across a damaged bridge. We can't tell the person the bridge is damaged as he doesn't speak your language. According to Soft paternalism we would be justified in forcing him to not cross the bridge so we could find out whether he knows about the damage. If he knows and wants to jump off the bridge and commit suicide then we should allow him to. Hard paternalists say that at least sometimes we are entitled to prevent him from crossing the bridge and committing suicide.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/#Intr |title=Paternalism |author=Gerald Dworkin |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pure and impure===
Pure paternalism is paternalism where the person(s) having their liberty or autonomy taken away are those being protected. Impure paternalism occurs when the class of people whose liberty or autonomy is violated by some measure is wider than the group of persons thereby protected.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

===Moral and welfare===
Moral paternalism is where paternalism is justified to promote the moral well being of a person(s) even if their welfare wouldn't improve. For example, it would be argued that someone should be prevented from prostitution even if they make a decent living off it and their health is protected. A moral paternalist would argue that it is ethical considering prostitution is morally corrupting.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

== Criteria for effective paternalism ==
[[Thomas Pogge]] argues that there are a number of criteria for paternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=World poverty and human rights|date=2008|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4143-0|edition=2nd|url=http://thomaspogge.com/paternalism/|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The concept should work within human flourishing. Generally accepted items such as nutrition, clothing, shelter, certain basic freedoms may be acceptable by a range of religious and social backgrounds. 
*The criteria should be minimally intrusive.
*The requirements of the criteria should not be understood as exhaustive; leaving societies the ability to modify the criteria based on their own needs.
*The supplementary considerations introduced by such more ambitious criteria of justice must not be allowed to outweigh the modest considerations.{{elucidate|date=March 2015}}

==Opponents==
{{See also|Social engineering (political science)|Nanny state}}
In his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', [[John Locke]] argues (against [[Robert Filmer]]) that political and paternal power cannot be identified.

[[John Stuart Mill]] opposes state paternalism on the grounds that individuals know their own good better than the state does, that the moral equality of persons demands respect for others' liberty, and that paternalism disrupts the development of an independent character. In ''On Liberty'' he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right.&lt;ref name=Mill1859/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary opponents of paternalism often appeal to the ideal of personal [[autonomy]].

==In society==

In the southern [[United States]] before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], paternalism was a concept used to justify the legitimacy of [[slavery]]. Women would present themselves as mothers for the slaves, or protectors that provided benefits the slaves would not get on their own. Plantation mistresses would attempt to civilize their workers by providing food, shelter, and affection. These women would justify that the conditions for freed blacks were poorer than those who were under the mistresses' protection. Paternalism was used as an argument against the emancipation of slavery due to these mistresses providing better living conditions than the enslaved's counterpart in the factory-based north.&lt;ref&gt;Erin R. Mulligan, “Paternalism and the Southern Hierarchy: How Slaves Defined Antebellum Southern Women,” Armstrong Undergraduate ''Journal of History'' 2, no. 2, August 2012 [https://www.armstrong.edu/history-journal/history-journal-paternalism-and-the-southern-hierarchy-how-slavery-defined]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this conclusion, often the whites would manage basic rights of the enslaved such as child rearing and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eiu.edu/historia/Cole.pdf|title=The Excuse of Paternalism in the Antebellum South: Ideology or Practice?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paternalism was also used against [[Women's Suffrage]], with opponents of women's suffrage saying that granting women the right to vote would make their lives harder and separate them from their families.

'''Political science''' is a [[social science]] which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of [[politics|political]] activities, political thoughts, and political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/political-science%20Oxford%20Dictionary:%20political%20science Oxford Dictionary: political science]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and resources. Political scientists "see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/political-science/ Political Science]. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (22 February 1999). Retrieved on 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science -- occasionally called politicology -- comprises numerous subfields, including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], [[international relations]], [[political theory]], [[public administration]], [[public policy]], and [[political methodology]].  Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of [[economics]], [[Legal education|law]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[geography]], [[psychology]]/[[psychiatry]], and [[anthropology]].

Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of [[constitutions]], political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. [[International relations]] deals with the interaction between [[nation-state]]s as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in [[social research]]. Approaches include [[positivism]], [[Verstehen|interpretivism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[behaviouralism]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], and pluralism. Political science, as one of the [[social science]]s, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], [[case studies]], experimental research, and model building.

==Overview==
Political scientists study matters concerning the allocation and transfer of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in [[decision making]], the roles and systems of governance including [[governments]] and [[international organizations]], political behaviour and [[public policies]]. They measure the success of [[governance]] and specific policies by examining many factors, including [[Economic stability|stability]], [[justice]], [[material wealth]],  [[peace]] and [[public health]]. Some political scientists seek to advance [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] (attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) theses by analysing politics. Others advance [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] theses, by making specific policy recommendations.

Political scientists provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the [[Constituency|electorate]] analyse issues. According to Chaturvedy,
{{quote|Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties or as civil servants. They may be involved with [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to [[corporation]]s. Private enterprises such as [[think tank]]s, research institutes, polling and [[public relations]] firms often employ political scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaturvedy|first1=J. C.|title=Political Governance: Political theory|publisher=Isha Books|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzV4V59udu8C&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=28 October 2014|isbn=9788182053175|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, political scientists known as "[[American politics (political science)|Americanists]]" look at a variety of data including [[United States Constitution|constitutional development]], [[elections]], [[public opinion]], and [[public policy]] such as [[Social Security reform]], [[foreign policy]], [[US Congress]]ional committees, and the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]&amp;nbsp;— to name only a few issues.

Because political science is essentially a study of [[human behaviour]], in all aspects of [[politics]], observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though [[experiment]]al methods are increasingly common (see [[experimental political science]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Druckman|editor1-first=James|editor2-first=Donald|editor2-last=Green|editor3-first=James|editor3-last=Kuklinski|editor4-first=Arthur|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Lupia|year=2011|title=Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-17455-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing this difficulty, former [[American Political Science Association]] President [[Lawrence Lowell]] once said "We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science."&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. 1910. "The Physiology of Politics." ''American Political Science Review'' 4: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.

Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in [[biology]] or inanimate objects as in [[physics]]. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. In fact, the designation "political scientist" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|title=How to Become a Political Scientist|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/political-scientists.htm#tab-4|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena.  To date, the &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/apsr|title=American Political Science Association &gt; PUBLICATIONS &gt; About APSA Journals &gt; American Political Science Review|website=www.apsanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;American Political Science Review is the leading journal in Political Science research. 

===Behavioural revolution and new institutionalism===

In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioural revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behaviour swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behaviour, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioural political science, including work by [[Robert Dahl]], [[Philip Converse]], and in the collaboration between sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and public opinion scholar [[Bernard Berelson]].

The late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive, [[game theory|game theoretic]] formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behaviour, such as voting. [[William H. Riker]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of Rochester]] were the main proponents of this shift.

Despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Quaile Hill, "In Search of General Theory," Journal of Politics 74(October 2012), 917-931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anticipating of crises===

The theory of political transitions,&lt;ref&gt;Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677820 "A theory of political transitions."] American Economic Review. 2001 Sep 1:938-963.&lt;/ref&gt; and the methods of their analysis and anticipating of crises,&lt;ref&gt;McClelland C.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600146 "The Anticipation of International Crises: Prospects for Theory and Research."] International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 1, Special Issue on International Crisis:Progress and Prospects for Applied Forecasting and Management (March 1977), pp. 15-38&lt;/ref&gt; form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M., Carpenter S.R., Lenton T.M., Bascompte J., Brock W., Dakos V., Van De Koppel J., Van De Leemput I.A., Levin S.A., Van Nes E.H., Pascual M. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/344 "Anticipating critical transitions."] Science. 2012 Oct 19;338(6105):344-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, a statistical indicator of crisis, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]] in large groups, was proposed for crises anticipation and successfully used in various areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T. A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuran T. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025019 "Sparks and prairie fires: A theory of unanticipated political revolution."] Public Choice, Vol. 61, No. 1 (April 1989), pp. 41–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science in the Soviet Union===
In the [[Soviet Union]], political studies were carried out under the guise of some other disciplines like theory of state and [[law]], [[area studies]], [[international relations]], studies of labor movement, "critique of bourgeois theories", etc. Soviet scholars were represented at the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA) since 1955 (since 1960 by the Soviet Association of Political and State Studies).

In 1979, the 11th World Congress of IPSA took place in [[Moscow]]. Until the late years of the Soviet Union, political science as a field was subjected to tight control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was thus subjected to distrust. Anti-communists accused political scientists of being "false" scientists and of having served the old regime.&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;Political Science in Russia: Institutionalization of the Discipline and Development of the Professional Community&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Soviet Union, two of the major institutions dealing with political science, the Institute of Contemporary Social Theories and the Institute of International Affairs, were disbanded, and most of their members were left without jobs. These institutes were victims of the first wave of [[anticommunist]] opinion and ideological attacks. Today, the Russian Political Science Association unites professional political scientists from all around Russia.

===Recent developments===
In 2000, the [[Perestroika Movement]] in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veelUVVHg8MC|title=Perestroika!: The Raucous Rebellion in Political Science|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300130201|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic [[cognitive bias]]es of current politics.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. "The evolutionary psychology of mass politics".

==Political science education==

Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, "as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name=Stoner&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoner |first=J. R. |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |title=Political Science and Political Education |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the APSA Teaching and Learning Conference ([[American Political Science Association|APSA]]), San Jose Marriott, [[San Jose, California]] |date=22 February 2008 |quote=... although one might allege the same for social science as a whole, political scientists receive funding from and play an active role in both the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [in the United States]. |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130234044/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |archivedate=30 November 2009 }} &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p245585_index.html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate [[College of Arts and Sciences|School
 or College of Arts and Sciences]] per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of Humanities or [[Liberal Arts]].&lt;ref name=Marist&gt;See, e.g., the department of [http://www.marist.edu/liberalarts/polsci/ Political Science] at [[Marist College]], part of a Division of Humanities before that division became the School of Liberal Arts (c. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas classical [[political philosophy]] is primarily defined by a concern for [[Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for "[[modernity]]" and the contemporary [[nation state]], along with the study of classical thought, and as such share a greater deal of terminology with [[sociologists]] (e.g. [[structure and agency]]).

Most [[United States]] [[Higher education in the United States|colleges and universities]] offer B.A. programs in political science. M.A. or M.A.T. and Ph.D. or Ed.D. programs are common at larger universities. The term ''political science'' is more popular in [[North America]] than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of ''political studies,'' ''politics,'' or ''government.'' While ''political science'' implies use of the [[scientific method]], ''political studies'' implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' is the term used to refer to this field by [[Brandeis University]]; [[Cornell College]]; [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; [[Hendrix College]]; [[Lake Forest College]]; [[Monash University]]; [[Mount Holyoke College]]; [[New York University]]; [[Occidental College]]; [[Princeton University]]; [[Ursinus College]]; [[Washington and Lee University]]; and [[Zeppelin University]]. ''Government'' is the term used for this field by [[Bowdoin College]]; [[Colby College]]; [[Cornell University]]; [[Dartmouth College]]; [[Georgetown University]]; [[Harvard University]]; [[Smith College]]; [[Wesleyan University]]; the [[College of William and Mary]]; the [[University of Sydney]]; the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; the [[University of Ulster]]; the [[University of Essex]]; [[Victoria University of Wellington]], which has both a "School of Government" and a separate "Political Science and International Relations Programme"; and the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. ''Politics and government'' is the term used by the [[University of Puget Sound]]. ''Government and politics'' is used by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;/ref&gt; Separate degree granting programs in international relations and [[public policy]] are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Master's level programs in political science are common when political scientists engage in [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vernardakis |first=George |title=Graduate education in government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd3DDiQm3M8C&amp;pg=PA77 |page=77 |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-1171-8 |quote=...existing practices at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is [[Pi Sigma Alpha]].

===Cognate fields===
Most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:
* [[Comparative politics]], including [[area studies]]
* [[International relations]]
* [[Political philosophy]] or political theory
* [[Public administration]]
* [[Public law]]

Some political science departments also classify [[methodology]] as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. In the United States, [[American political science|American politics]] is often treated as a separate subfield.

In contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, [[Theories of political behavior|political behaviour]] (including [[public opinion]], [[collective action]], and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]), and political institutions (including [[legislature]]s and [[international organization]]s). Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categories. The American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/content_4596.cfm APSA Organized Sections | APSA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Add sections here on each subfield --&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of political science}}

As a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. At that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]] which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. The term "political science" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.

The term '''political statement''' is used to refer to any act or non-verbal form of communication that is intended to influence a decision to be made for or by a political party.

A political statement can vary from a [[mass demonstration]] to the wearing of a badge with a [[political slogan]]. It was a term popularised in the 1960s but still has some currency.

The term has also been used to describe negotiated statements such as the [[Seville Statement on Violence]] or the [[Waldorf Statement]], or [[extempore]] utterances with political implications.

{{About|the biased form of communication||Propaganda (disambiguation)}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}

'''Propaganda''' is information that is not [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] and is used primarily to [[Social influence|influence]] an audience and further an [[Political agenda|agenda]], often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using [[loaded language]] to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.&lt;ref name="brit_BLS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Bruce L. | author-link = Bruce Lannes Smith | title = Propaganda | website = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Inc. | date = 17 February 2016 | url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/propaganda | access-date = 23 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies, religious organizations and the media can also produce propaganda. 

In the twentieth century, the term propaganda has often been associated with a [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term.&lt;ref name="brit_BLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. Propaganda is now moving into a digital age utillizing bots, algorithms, to create computational propaganda and [[Propaganda on social media|spread fake or biased news using social media]]. 

In a 1929 literary debate with [[Edward Bernays]], [[Everett Dean Martin]] argues that, "Propaganda is making puppets of us. We are moved by hidden strings which the propagandist manipulates."&lt;ref&gt; [[Everett Dean Martin|Martin, Everett Dean]], Are We Victims of Propaganda, Our Invisible Masters: A Debate with [[Edward Bernays]], The Forum, pp. 142–150, March 1929 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postflaviana.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/martin-bernays-debate.pdf |title=Martin Bernays debate |website=''postflaviana.org'' |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Propaganda'' is a modern Latin word, the gerundive form of ''propagare'', meaning ''to spread'' or ''to propagate'', thus ''propaganda'' means ''that which is to be propagated''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally this word derived from a new administrative body of the [[Catholic]] church ([[Congregation (Roman Curia)|congregation]]) created in 1622, called the ''[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]]'' (''Congregation for Propagating the Faith''), or informally simply ''Propaganda''.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=propaganda|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activity was aimed at "propagating" the Catholic faith in non-Catholic countries.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

From the 1790s, the term began being used also to refer to ''propaganda'' in secular activities.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt; The term began taking a pejorative or negative connotation in the mid-19th century, when it was used in the political sphere.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of propaganda}}

Primitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists. The [[Behistun Inscription]] (c. 515 BC) detailing the rise of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]] to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nagle|first=D. Brendan|title=The Ancient World: Readings in Social and Cultural History|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-69187-6|author2=Stanley M Burstein |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another striking example of propaganda during Ancient History is the last Roman civil wars (44-30 BC) during which [[Augustus|Octavian]] and [[Mark Antony]] blame each other for obscure and degrading origins, cruelty, cowardice, oratorical and literary incompetence, debaucheries, luxury, drunkenness and other slanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Borgies|first=Loïc|title=Le conflit propagandiste entre Octavien et Marc Antoine. De l'usage politique de la uituperatio entre 44 et 30 a. C. n.|year=2016|isbn=978-90-429-3459-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This defamation took the form of ''uituperatio'' (Roman rhetorical genre of the invective) which was decisive for shaping the Roman public opinion at this time.

Propaganda during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], helped by the spread of the [[printing press]] throughout Europe, and in particular within Germany, caused new ideas, thoughts, and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had never been seen before the 16th century. During the era of the [[American Revolution]], the American colonies had a flourishing network of newspapers and printers who specialized in the topic on behalf of the Patriots (and to a lesser extent on behalf of the Loyalists).&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Richard G, 1975, "The Reformation in Print: German Pamphlets and Propaganda. Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte – Archive for Reformation History", Pg. 93–102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anti-Japan2.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A propaganda newspaper clipping that refers to the [[Bataan Death March]] in 1942]]
The first large-scale and organised propagation of government propaganda was occasioned by the outbreak of [[First World War|war]] in 1914. After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as [[Erich Ludendorff]] suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: [[Dolchstoßlegende]]). In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda, which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in 1933. Historian [[Robert Ensor]] explains that "Hitler...puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny."&lt;ref&gt; Robert Ensor in David Thomson, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: volume XII The Era of Violence 1890–1945'' (1st edition 1960), p 84. &lt;/ref&gt; Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]]. [[World War II]] saw continued use of propaganda as a weapon of war, building on the experience of WWI, by Goebbels and the British [[Political Warfare Executive]], as well as the United States [[Office of War Information]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J. C., 2007, "Film propaganda in Britain and Nazi Germany : World War II cinema.", Oxford:Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doloy prazdniki.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Antireligion|Anti-religious]] Soviet propaganda poster, the Russian text reads "Ban Religious Holidays!"]]
In the early 20th century, the invention of motion pictures gave propaganda-creators a powerful tool for advancing political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy. In the years following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films (e.g. the 1925 film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' glorifies [[Communist]] ideals.) In WWII, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the [[Sudetenland]] and attacking Poland. The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of [[totalitarian]] states and the [[Second World War]], are arguably the "Golden Age of Propaganda". [[Leni Riefenstahl]], a filmmaker working in [[Nazi Germany]], created one of the best-known propaganda movies, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In the US, [[American Animation in World War II|animation]] became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g.,''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1942), which ridicules [[Hitler]] and advocates the value of freedom. US [[war film]]s in the early 1940s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and [[consensus|convince]] viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the [[Axis Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip M. Taylor, 1990, "Munitions of the mind: A history of propaganda”, Pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film ''Calling mr. Smith''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lux.org.uk/work/calling-mr-smith1|title=Calling Mr. Smith – LUX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9|title=Calling Mr Smith – Centre Pompidou}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1943) about current nazi crimes in occupied Europe and about lies of nazi propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artincinema.com/franciszka-and-stefan-themerson-calling-mr-smith-1943/|title=Franciszka and Stefan Themerson: Calling Mr. Smith (1943) – artincinema|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Bloc|West]] and the [[Soviet Union]] both used propaganda extensively during the [[Cold War]]. Both sides used film, television, and radio programming to influence their own citizens, each other, and Third World nations. [[George Orwell]]'s novels ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' are virtual textbooks on the use of propaganda. During the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Fidel Castro]] stressed the importance of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prudentiapolitica.blogspot.com/2014/05/fidel-propaganda-is-heart-of-our.html|title=Prudentia Politica|author=prudentiapolitica|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Blogspot is not a reliable source.|date=March 2017}} Propaganda was used extensively by Communist forces in the [[Vietnam War]] as means of controlling people's opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sophana2007vietnamese.pdf] Vietnamese propaganda reflections from 1945 to 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Yugoslav wars]], propaganda was used as a [[military strategy]] by governments of [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia. Propaganda was used to create fear and hatred, and particularly incite the Serb population against the other ethnicities ([[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], [[Albanians]] and other non-Serbs). Serb media made a great effort in justifying, revising or denying mass [[war crimes]] committed by Serb forces during these wars.&lt;ref name="Boston University"&gt;{{cite web|date=12 April 1999|title=Serbian Propaganda: A Closer Look|url=http://www.bu.edu/globalbeat/pubs/Pesic041299.html|quote=NOAH ADAMS: The European Center for War, Peace and the News Media, based in London, has received word from Belgrade that no pictures of mass Albanian refugees have been shown at all, and that the Kosovo humanitarian catastrophe is only referred to as the one made up or over-emphasised by Western propaganda.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perceptions== 
In the early 20th century the term propaganda was used by the founders of the nascent [[public relations]] industry to refer to their people. Literally translated from the [[Latin]] [[gerundive]] as "things that must be disseminated", in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term "propaganda" can also vary over time. For example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the [[Southern Cone]], the word "propaganda" usually refers to the most common manipulative media&amp;nbsp;– "advertising".

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Poster of the 19th-century [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist]] movement]]
In English, ''propaganda'' was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, representing the intentional dissemination of often false, but certainly "compelling" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies. According to [[Harold Lasswell]], the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the [[Committee on Public Information|Creel Committee]] in the United States and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in Britain: Writing in 1928, Lasswell observed, "In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm, for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends. The outcry in the United States against Mr. Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information (or 'Inflammation') helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed. … The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it. Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate, and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as 'public relations council,' 'specialist in public education,' 'public relations adviser.' "&lt;ref&gt;pp. 260–261, "The Function of the Propagandist", ''International Journal of Ethics'', 38 (no. 3): pp. 258–268.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, political science professor Dayton David McKean wrote, "After World War I the word came to be applied to 'what you don’t like of the other fellow’s publicity,' as Edward L. Bernays said...."&lt;ref&gt;p. 113, ''Party and Pressure Politics'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is essentially contested and some have argued for a neutral definition&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press p 9 &amp;  Taylor, Phil M. (2002), ‘Debate: Strategic Communications or Democratic Propaganda?’, in Journalism Studies, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 437–452.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that ethics depend on intent and context,&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press&lt;/ref&gt; others define it as necessarily unethical and negative.&lt;ref&gt;Doob, L.W. (1949), Public Opinion and Propaganda, London: Cresset Press p 240&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Emma Briant defines it as "the deliberate manipulation of representations (including text, pictures, video, speech etc.) with the intention of producing any effect in the audience (e.g. action or inaction; reinforcement or transformation of feelings, ideas, attitudes or behaviours) that is desired by the propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press p 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Identifying propaganda has always been a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J Schwindt, [https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Modern-World-Traditionalist/dp/153282534X The Case Against the Modern World: A Crash Course in Traditionalist Thought], 2016, pp. 202–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The main difficulties have involved differentiating propaganda from other types of [[persuasion]], and avoiding a [[bias]]ed approach. Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term: "Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for [[ideology|ideological]], political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Alan Nelson, ''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'' (1996) pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; The definition focuses on the communicative process involved – or more precisely, on the purpose of the process, and allow "propaganda" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener. 
[[File:Propaganda poster in a primary school - DPRK (2604154887).jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster in North Korean primary school]]

According to historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]], propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite book|title=Selling the War|publisher=Orbis Publishing|first=Zbynek|last=Zeman|date=1978|ISBN=0-85613-312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare with [[black operation]], a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported.
&lt;!-- [[File:Edith Cavell propaganda.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of British nurse [[Edith Cavell#Role in World War I propaganda|Edith Cavell]] by the German Army in 1915 was a major theme of [[World War I]] anti-German propaganda.]] --&gt;

[[File:Propaganda Poster in North Korea.jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster in North Korea]]

The propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group. Propaganda, in this sense, serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved, not by filling people's minds with approved information, but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view. What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding. The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue, but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda.

===Religious===
Propaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues, particularly during the split between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]].

More in line with the religious roots of the term, propaganda is also used widely in the debates about [[new religious movement]]s (NRMs), both by people who defend them and by people who oppose them. The latter pejoratively call these NRMs [[cult]]s. [[Anti-cult movement|Anti-cult activists]] and [[Christian countercult movement|Christian countercult activists]] accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them. Some social scientists, such as the late Jeffrey Hadden, and [[CESNUR]] affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of "cults" and the [[anti-cult movement]] of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Religious Movements Page: Conceptualizing "Cult" and "Sect" | url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207042448/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archivedate=7 February 2006 | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Polish Anti-Cult Movement (Koscianska) – CESNUR | url=http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/riga2000/koscianska.htm | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime===
[[File:AntiJapanesePropagandaTakeDayOff.png|thumb|upright|left|A US Office for War Information poster uses [[stereotype]]d imagery to encourage Americans to work hard to contribute to the war effort]]

Post–World War II usage of the word "propaganda" more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas.

Propaganda is a powerful weapon in war; it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy, either internal or external, by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens. This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms (e.g., the racist terms "Jap" and "gook" used during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively), avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities. Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice, which may be fictitious or may be based on facts (e.g., the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania]] by the German Navy in World War I). The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just. In NATO doctrine, propaganda is defined as "Any information, ideas, doctrines, or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion, emotions, attitudes, or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly."&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency Aap-6 –  Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this perspective, information provided does not need to be necessarily false, but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the "actor" or "system" that performs it.

Propaganda is also one of the methods used in [[psychological warfare]], which may also involve [[false flag]] operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation (e.g., The [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings). The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes (e.g., During the First World War, the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army, and women to work in the country's industry. The propaganda posters were used, because radios and TVs were not very common at that time.).&lt;ref&gt;Callanan, James D. The Evolution of The CIA's Covert Action Mission, 1947–1963. Durham University. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that, if people believe something false, they will constantly be assailed by doubts. Since these doubts are unpleasant (see [[cognitive dissonance]]), people will be eager to have them extinguished, and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power. For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented. This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select "agreeable" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations.

Propaganda may be administered in insidious ways. For instance, disparaging [[disinformation]] about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system. Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school, such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents, thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a "well-known fact", even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source. The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system, without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media. Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals: by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country, they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others.

In the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin, who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic. On the other hand, the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Karel C. Berkhoff, ''Motherland in Danger: Soviet Propaganda during World War II'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Motherland-Danger-Soviet-Propaganda-during/dp/0674049241/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin was a Georgian who spoke Russian with a heavy accent. That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero. Only his eyes and famous mustache remained unaltered. Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his "majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhores A. Medvedev and |title=The Unknown Stalin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3BrNF80AzUC&amp;pg=PA248|year=2003|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 20 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] prohibits any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes [[incitement]] to discrimination, hostility or violence by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|website=United Nations Human Rights: Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

===Advertising===
Propaganda shares techniques with advertising and [[public relations]], each of which can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization, person, or brand.

[[File:'Destroy this mad brute' WWI propaganda poster (US version).jpg|thumb|upright|[[World War I]] propaganda poster for enlistment in the [[American Expeditionary Forces|U.S. Army]]]]
Journalistic theory generally holds that news items should be objective, giving the reader an accurate background and analysis of the subject at hand. On the other hand, advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news. These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light, primarily meant to persuade rather than inform. Normally they use only subtle [[propaganda techniques]] and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements. If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item, the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily "believed" or "internalized". Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of "covert" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda, which is misleading. Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement.

===Politics===
Propaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with [[public information]] campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]], posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other [[Mass media|medium]]. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of '''overt propaganda''') and what the Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as "covert propaganda".

Roderick Hindery argues&lt;ref&gt;Hindery, Roderick R., Indoctrination and Self-deception or Free and Critical Thought? (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; that propaganda exists on the political left, and right, and in mainstream centrist parties. Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking "what is or is not propaganda?" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda, indoctrination, and terrorism/counterterrorism. He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself.

Since [[9/11]] and the appearance of greater media fluidity, propaganda institutions, practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain. [[Dr Emma Louise Briant]] shows how this included expansion and integration of the apparatus cross-government and details attempts to coordinate the forms of propaganda for foreign and domestic audiences, with new efforts in [[strategic communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briant|title=Allies and Audiences Evolving Strategies in Defense and Intelligence Propaganda|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=April 2015|volume=20|issue=2|pages=145–165|url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/20/2/145.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were subject to contestation within the [[US Government]], resisted by [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] [[Public affairs (military)|Public Affairs]] and critiqued by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briant|first1=Emma|title=Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: strategies for global change|date=2015|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (section 1078 (a)) amended the US Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (popularly referred to as the [[Smith-Mundt Act]]) and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within U.S. borders for the Archivist of the United States. The Smith-Mundt Act, as amended, provided that "the Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall make available to the Archivist of the United States, for domestic distribution, motion pictures, films, videotapes, and other material 12 years after the initial dissemination of the material abroad (...) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from engaging in any medium or form of communication, either directly or indirectly, because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material, or based on a presumption of such exposure." Public concerns were raised upon passage due to the relaxation of prohibitions of domestic propaganda in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smith-Mundt Act|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130715/11210223804/anti-propaganda-ban-repealed-freeing-state-dept-to-direct-its-broadcasting-arm-american-citizens.shtml|website='Anti-Propaganda' Ban Repealed, Freeing State Dept.

==Techniques==
{{details|Propaganda techniques}}

[[File:Anti-capitalism color.gif|right|upright|thumb|[[Anti-Capitalism|Anti-capitalist]] propaganda]]

Common media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports, government reports, historical revision, [[junk science]], books, leaflets, [[propaganda film|movies]], radio, television, and posters. Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to [[indoctrinate]] the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission, such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. (as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals). The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to [[opinion leader]] through indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;Garth S. Jowett and Victoria J.: O'Donnell, ''Propaganda &amp; Persuasion'' (5th ed. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of techniques based in [[social psychology|social psychological]] research are used to generate propaganda. Many of these same techniques can be found under [[Fallacy|logical fallacies]], since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.

Some time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted. That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with ''propagandistic messages''. Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. &lt;!-- Commented out: Below are a number of techniques for generating propaganda: [[File:Destroy the old world Cultural Revolution poster.png|right|thumb|Chinese propaganda to urge people to "destroy the old world, forge the new world," referring to the cultural aspects acceptable and unacceptable by the country's [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], 1966.]] --&gt;

==Models==

===Social psychology===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, "Stürmerkasten".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', [[Worms]], Germany, 1935]]
The field of [[social psychology]] includes the study of [[persuasion]]. Social psychologists can be [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociologists]] or [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychologists]]. The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion. For example, communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors (e.g., the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication), influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them. Nobel Prize–winning psychologist [[Herbert A. Simon]] won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are [[cognitive miser]]s. That is, in a society of mass information, people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially, as opposed to logically.

According to [[William W. Biddle]]'s 1931 article "A psychological definition of propaganda", "[t]he four principles followed in propaganda are: (1) rely on emotions, never argue; (2) cast propaganda into the pattern of "we" versus an "enemy"; (3) reach groups as well as individuals; (4) hide the propagandist as much as possible."&lt;ref&gt;Biddle, William W. [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1932-03618-001 A psychological definition of propaganda]. [[The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]], Vol 26(3), Oct 1931, 283–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herman and Chomsky===
[[File:Come unto me, ye opprest.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Early 20th-century depiction of a "European [[Anarchism|Anarchist]]" attempting to destroy the [[Statue of Liberty]]]]

The [[propaganda model]] is a theory advanced by [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] which argues [[systemic bias]]es in the mass media and seeks to explain them in terms of structural economic [[cause]]s:

{{quote|The 20th century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance: the growth of democracy, the growth of [[corporate power]], and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from Noam Chomsky" to ''Covert Action Quarterly,'' quoting [[Alex Carey (writer)|Alex Carey]], Australian social scientist, {{cite web |url=http://mediafilter.org/caq/CAQ54chmky.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710125156/http://mediafilter.org/caq/CAQ54chmky.html |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/25/006.html|title=Review of Alex Carey, Taking the Risk out of Democracy: Propaganda in the US and Australia|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

First presented in their 1988 book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', the [[propaganda model]] views the private media as businesses selling a product&amp;nbsp;– readers and [[audiences]] (rather than news)&amp;nbsp;– to other businesses (advertisers) and relying primarily on government and corporate information and propaganda. The theory postulates five general classes of "filters" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media: [[Ownership]] of the medium, the medium's Funding, Sourcing of the news, [[Propaganda model#Flak|Flak]], and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ideology.

The first three (ownership, funding, and sourcing) are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. Although the model was based mainly on the characterization of United States media, Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles the [[model (abstract)|model]] postulates as the cause of [[media bias]].

==Children==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
[[File:Propaganda do Estado Novo (Brasil).jpg|thumb|upright|A 1938 propaganda of the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|New State]] depicting Brazilian President [[Getúlio Vargas]] flanked by children. The text on the bottom right of this poster translates as: "Children! Learning, at home and in school, the cult of the Fatherland, you will bring all chances of success to life. Only love builds and, strongly loving Brazil, you will lead it to the greatest of destinies among Nations, fulfilling the desires of exaltation nestled in every Brazilian heart."]]

The text reads: "Sandinista children: Toño, Delia and Rodolfo are in the Association of Sandinista Children. Sandinista children use a [[neckerchief]]. They participate in the revolution and are very studious."]]
Of all the potential targets for propaganda, children are the most vulnerable because they are the least prepared with the critical reasoning and contextual comprehension they need to determine whether a message is propaganda or not. The attention children give their environment during development, due to the process of developing their understanding of the world, causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately. Also, children are highly imitative: studies by [[Albert Bandura]], [[Dorothea Ross]] and [[Sheila A. Ross]] in the 1960s indicated that, to a degree, [[socialization]], formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of [[indoctrination]]. The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany, as well as in [[Stalinist]] Russia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} 
[[John Taylor Gatto]] asserts that modern schooling in the USA is designed to "dumb us down" in order to turn children into material suitable to work in factories. This ties into the Herman &amp; Chomsky thesis of rise of Corporate Power, and its use in creating educational systems which serve its purposes against those of democracy.

===Anti-Semitic propaganda for children===
In [[Nazi]] Germany, the education system was thoroughly co-opted to indoctrinate the German youth with [[anti-Semitic]] ideology. This was accomplished through the [[National Socialist Teachers League]], of which 97% of all German teachers were members in 1937. The League encouraged the teaching of racial theory. Picture books for children such as ''Don't Trust A Fox in A Green Meadow or The Word of A Jew'', ''[[Der Giftpilz]]'' (translated into English as ''The Poisonous Mushroom'') and ''The Poodle-Pug-Dachshund-Pincher'' were widely circulated (over 100,000 copies of ''Don't Trust A Fox''...&amp;nbsp;were circulated during the late 1930s) and contained depictions of Jews as devils, child molesters and other morally charged figures. Slogans such as "Judas the Jew betrayed Jesus the German to the Jews" were recited in class.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Mary. "Propaganda and Children During the Hitler Years". Jewish Virtual Library. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/propchil.html&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example of a propagandistic math problem recommended by the National Socialist Essence of Education: "The Jews are aliens in Germany—in 1933 there were 66,606,000 inhabitants in the German Reich, of whom 499,682 (.75%) were Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, Herbert. ''Genocide and the Politics of Memory''. Chapel Hill &amp; London: University of North Carolina Press, 1995. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">A '''puppet ruler''' is a person who has a title indicating possession of [[political power]], but who, in reality, is controlled by outside individuals or forces.  Such outside power can be exercised by a foreign government, in which case the puppet ruler's domain is called a [[puppet state]].  But the puppet ruler may also be controlled by internal forces, such as non-elected officials.

== Examples ==
=== In Latin America ===
Governing through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in [[Latin America]]. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian façade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]], [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Núñez]] of [[Colombia]], [[Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez]] of [[Costa Rica]], [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], [[Ulises Heureaux]] and [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Gabriel García Moreno]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Raoul Cédras]] of [[Haiti]], [[Porfirio Díaz]] and [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] of [[Mexico]], the [[Somoza family]] of [[Nicaragua]], [[José Antonio Remón Cantera]], [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]], [[Dési Bouterse]] of [[Suriname]], and [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] and [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] of [[Venezuela]]. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the "puppets" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.
=== Elsewhere ===

A puppet does not have to be a national ruler.  For example, [[Oscar K. Allen]] was widely recognized to be [[Huey Long]]'s puppet while serving as governor of [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5107&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Interwar period|the years before]] and during [[World War II]], [[Puyi]], the deposed [[Emperor of China]], is usually considered to have been the [[Emperor of Manchukuo|puppet ruler of]] [[Manchukuo]], a [[client state]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] on the Chinese mainland. &lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Win Myint (politician)|Win Myint]], the current [[President of Myanmar|president]] of [[Myanmar]], is widely viewed by political commentators as a puppet president for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who is constitutionally barred from holding the office of president.

'''Reformism''' is a political doctrine advocating the [[reform]] of an existing system or institution instead of its abolition and replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/reformism | title=Reformism | author=Collins English Dictionary | year= | website= | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers | accessdate=8 August 2017 | quote= a doctrine or movement advocating reform, esp political or religious reform, rather than abolition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[socialist]] movement, reformism is the view that gradual changes through existing institutions can eventually lead to fundamental changes in a society’s [[Political system|political]] and [[economic system]]s. Reformism as a political tendency and hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that revolutionary upheaval is a necessary precondition for the structural changes necessary to transform a [[capitalist]] system to a qualitatively different socialist economic system.

As a doctrine, reformism is distinguished from the act of pragmatic reform: pragmatic reform aims to safeguard and permeate the status quo by preventing fundamental structural changes to it, whereas reformism posits that an accumulation of reforms can eventually lead to the emergence of entirely different economic and political systems than those of present-day capitalism and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today and Jesus followers | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | website= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are two types of reformism. One has no intention of bringing about socialism or fundamental economic change to society and is used to oppose such structural changes. The other is based on the assumption that while reforms are not socialist in themselves, they can help rally supporters to the cause of revolution by popularizing the cause of socialism to the working class.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate on the ability for [[social democratic]] reformism to lead to a socialist transformation of society is over a century old.

Reformism is criticized for being paradoxical: it seeks to overcome the existing economic system of capitalism, but it tries to improve the conditions of capitalism thereby making it appear more tolerable to society. According to [[Rosa Luxemburg]], under reformism, "(capitalism) is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm | title=Do We Support Reformist Demands? | author=Duncan Hallas | year=1973 | website=Controversy: Do we support reformist demands? | publisher=International Socialism | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Stan Parker of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] argues that reforms are a diversion of energy for socialists and are limited because they must adhere to the logic of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism |title=Reformism - or socialism? |author=Stan Parker |date=March 2002 |publisher=Socialist Standard |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French social theorist [[Andre Gorz]] criticized reformism by advocating a third alternative to reformism and social revolution that he called "non-reformist reforms", specifically focused on structural changes to capitalism, as opposed to reforms for improve living conditions within capitalism or to prop it up through economic interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/363/do-we-need-reform-or-revolution |title=Do we need reform of revolution?|author=Lois Clifton |date=November 2011 |publisher=Socialist Review |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1875 [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) adopted a [[Gotha Program]] that proposed "every lawful means" on a way to a "socialist society" and was criticized by [[Karl Marx]] who considered the [[communist revolution]] a required step. One of the delegates to the SPD congress,  [[Eduard Bernstein]], expanded on the concept, proposing ''evolutionary socialism''. Bernstein was a leading [[social democracy|social democrat]] in Germany. Reformism was quickly targeted by [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]], with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemning Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Reform or Revolution?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm Rosa Luxemburg. ''Reform or Revolution'' (1900)]&lt;/ref&gt; While Luxemburg died in the [[German Revolution]], the reformists soon found themselves contending with the [[Bolsheviks]] and their satellite [[Communism|communist]] parties for the support of intellectuals and the [[working class]].

In 1959, the [[Godesberg Program]] (signed at a party convention in the West German capital of [[Bad Godesberg]]) marked the shift of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) from a Marxist program espousing an end to capitalism to a reformist one focused on social reform.

After [[Joseph Stalin]] consolidated power in the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Comintern]] launched a campaign against the Reformist movement by denouncing them as "[[Social fascism|social fascists]]".  According to ''[[The God that Failed]]'' by [[Arthur Koestler]], a former member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], the largest communist party in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Interwar period]], communists, aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], continued to consider the "social fascist" Social Democratic Party of Germany to be the real enemy in [[Germany]], even after the [[Nazi Party]] had gotten into power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler|Koestler, Arthur]]. ''[[The God That Failed]].'' Edited by [[Richard Crossman]]. Bantam Matrix, Tenth Edition. pp 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, reformists are seen as [[centre-left]]. Some social democratic parties, such as the Canadian [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, are still considered to be reformist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/dowson/ndp.html#3|title=The Socialist Vanguard and the New Democratic Party|last=Dowson|first=Ross|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformism in the British Labour Party==
The term was applied to elements within the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the 1950s and subsequently, on the party's right. [[Anthony Crosland]] wrote ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956) as a personal manifesto arguing for a reformulation of the term. For Crosland, the relevance of [[nationalization]] (or [[public ownership]]) for socialists was much reduced as a consequence of contemporary [[full employment]], [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] management of the economy and reduced [[capitalism|capitalist]] exploitation. In 1960, after the third successive defeat of his party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 General Election]] [[Hugh Gaitskell]] attempted to reformulate the original wording of [[Clause IV]] in the party's constitution, but proved unsuccessful.

Some of the younger followers of Gaitskell, principally [[Roy Jenkins]], [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] left the Labour Party in 1981 to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], but the central objective of the [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellites]] was eventually achieved by [[Tony Blair]] in his successful attempt to rewrite Clause IV in 1995.

The use of the term is distinguished from the [[gradualism]] associated with [[Fabianism]] (the ideology of the [[Fabian Society]]), which itself should not be seen as being in parallel with the revisionism associated with Bernstein and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, as originally the Fabians had explicitly rejected [[Marxism]].

The '''Revisionist school of Islamic studies''', (also '''Historical-Critical school of Islamic studies''') is a movement within Islamic studies which started in the 1970s and initiated a [[paradigm shift]] in Islamic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, edited by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main thesis and the concept of Revisionism ==

The core concern of the Revisionist School is to finally show consequence concerning the knowledge, practically available since [[Ignác Goldziher]]'s time, that the traditional Islamic accounts about [[Islam]]'s early times - written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad - are highly questionable as historical sources. This relates to [[Muhammad]]'s biography, the formation history of the [[Quran]], and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed by applying the [[historical criticism|historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation ''Revisionism'' was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a dismissive undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010. Judith Herrin, [https://www.opendemocracy.net/judith-herrin/patricia-crone-brief-memoir Patricia Crone: memoir of a superb Islamic Scholar], openDemocracy 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Today, also the adherents of the new movement use ''Revisionism'' to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Patricia Crone: [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/42023/among-the-believers Among the Believers], Tablet Magazine 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The major representatives ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The new movement originated at the [[SOAS, University of London]] by two publications of [[John Wansbrough]]: ''Quranic Studies'' (1977) and ''The Sectarian Milieu'' (1978). Among the students of Wansbrough are: [[Andrew Rippin]], [[Norman Calder]], [[G. R. Hawting]], [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]. With their work ''Hagarism'' (1977) Patricia Crone and Michael Cook set a milestone in Islamic Studies, since by provocative theses they provided maximal attention in the academic community. Later, both distanced themselves from their too far reaching theses in ''[[Hagarism]]''. Yet they adhered to the basically new academic approach. [[Martin Hinds]], too, studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. [[Robert G. Hoyland]] is a student of Patricia Crone.

A second local focus of the new movement is at the [[Saarland University]] in [[Saarbrücken]], Germany ({{ill|Saarbrücker Schule|de}}). Since the 1970s there is a focus on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran, by [[Günter Lüling]] und [[Gerd R. Puin|Gerd-Rüdiger Puin]]. Also in Saarbrücken, [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]] developed in the 2000s together with [[Volker Popp]], [[Christoph Luxenberg]] and [[Markus Groß]] a theory of Islam's earliest times which has no need for Muhammad as a historical person.

Further representatives are: [[Hans Jansen]] from the Netherlands who in 2005/7 published a work showing in detail why the known accounts of Muhammad's life are legends only. [[Yehuda D. Nevo]] published in 2003 his work ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' in which he denies the historicity of Muhammad. [[James A. Bellamy]] is known for his textual criticism of the Quran and for his proposals of emendations, i.e. proposals to correct the traditional text of the Quran. [[Fred Donner]] published in 2010 the first well-founded hypothesis on the early time of Islam without excessive exaggerations which found public attention.

[[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] studied history and became a renowned author of popular science publications on ancient history. With his work ''[[In the Shadow of the Sword (book)|In the Shadow of the Sword]]'' (2012) Tom Holland contributed heavily to the popularization of the new research results. Tom Holland depicts a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches, thus having like Fred Donner provided a well-founded hypothesis of Islam's early times which avoids exaggerations.

[[Sven Kalisch]] is a German Islamic theologian who rejected teaching Islamic theology without considering the new results of historical-critical research. Thereupon the German Islamic associations withdrew his allowance to teach future Islamic theologians and teachers. Later Kalisch left Islam. Today he is teaching the history of ideas in the Near East in Late Antiquity in [[Münster]].

== The thesis of the incredibility of the traditional Islamic accounts ==
The arguments against the credibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. [[Hans Jansen]] in his work ''De Historische Mohammed''. Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by [[Ibn Ishaq]] resp. [[Ibn Hisham]] which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.

Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jansen, ''De Historische Mohammed'', 2005/7&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although there were [[leap month]]s at the time of Muhammad which had to be intercalated frequently into the moon calendar and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq is in a leap month.
* The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later is not very credible.
* The depiction of a strong relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha is motivated politically resp. theologically: [[Aisha]] was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, [[Ali]]. In order to legitimate this succession against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that the prophet consummated marriage with Aisha allegedly at an astonishingly early age. 
* The depiction of slaughtering the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qurayza]] is motivated politically resp. theologically: As the "[[Constitution of Medina|treaty of Medina]]" shows, the Jews were initially part of the [[Umma]] and were addressed as "believers"; cf. the research of Prof. [[Fred Donner]]. When Islam later separated from Judaism, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished but not each single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the "treaty of Medina". Finally, such an mass slaughtering would not have gone unnoticed, even not in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews: Jews used to live in international trading networks, and Jews are known to write down their history. Most likely, the slaughtering of the Banu Quraiza never happened.
* The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to boldly exaggerate the capacities of the prophet. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad always kills more enemies than according to other traditions. Even the depiction of he prophet's male potency (who allegedly could satisfy all his wives in one night) is exaggerated in a questionable way. Of the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as an illiterate person. The [[revelation]] of the [[Quran]]ic text is all the more miraculous and the capacity of the prophet is all the more astonishing if Muhammad was an illiterate person.
* The account of [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State]] including the emperor of Byzantium, that they should convert to Islam, retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion.

Jansen points out that the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation of the Quran. The Quran mostly does not reveal the situation for which a revelation was made. The historical context is merely indicated, at best. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.

In her work ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' Patricia Crone gave a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This examination is much cited in literature yet discusses only a few aspects of Muhammad's biography meant to be exemplary for the nature of all the Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: ''""These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there ''was'' an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities."''&lt;ref name="crone-encounter"&gt;Patricia Crone: Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, 1987, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

== The new theses about the true beginnings of Islam ==
Starting point for all researchers is the awareness that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:

* The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later resp. were reworked later. In addition to that many small deviations came into the text as usual with ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.&lt;ref&gt;John Wansbrough: ''Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation'' (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd-Rüdiger Puin: ''Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San’a’'', in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur’an as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence and meaning of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially with the question whether any and how many parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or, whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time. The researchers' opinions differ in this question.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003); Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Donner suggests an early date for the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'' (1998), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Quran is not written in a "pure" Arabic yet the syriac Aramaic language seems to have a certain influence on the language of the Quran which was forgotten later. This could be a possible explanation why a fifth of the Quranic text is difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 377 ff.; Christoph Luxenberg: ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran – A Contribution to the Decoding of the Koran'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Islam did not rise among polytheistic pagans in the desert, yet in a milieu where Jewish and Christian texts were well-known. The "infidels" were no pagan polytheists yet monotheists who were considered to deviate slightly from monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Hawting: ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Rise of Islam: From Polemic to History'' (1999); Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* The geographical descriptions in the Quran and later traditions do not fit to Mecca. They rather point to  a place somewhere in north-western Arabia, e.g. to Petra in Jordania.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) pp. 22-24; Patricia Crone: ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' (1987); and the private researcher Dan Gibson: ''Quranic Geography'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The connection of Muslims and Jews was very close in the early times of Islam. Also Jews were called "believers" and were part of the umma. Antisemitic texts as e.g. the slaughtering of the Jewish tribe of the Banu Qurayza came into being long after Muhammad when Islam separated from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) pp. 68 ff.; cf. also Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7) pp. 311-317 (German edition 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the beginning, secular and spiritual power were united in the person of the caliph. There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: ''God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Islamic expansion probably was no Islamic, religiously motivated expansion, yet a secular, Arabic expansion. The expansion did not yet result in an oppression of the non-Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Hoyland: ''In God's Path. The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Muhammad there were at least two phases which were of major importance for the formation of Islam in its later shape:
** Under the Umayyad caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was built. There the word "Islam" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply "believers", and coins ware minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003) pp. 410-413; Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 336 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
** During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest to legitimize their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone: ''Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity'' (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: ''Mohammed'' (2005/7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Revisionism ==

The consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book ''Hagarism'' (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.
&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism is expressed by researchers like [[Tilman Nagel]], who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/islamwissenschaft-befreit-den-propheten-aus-seiner-religioesen-umklammerung-1464313.html Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religiösen Umklammerung!] in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
A certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to "revisionism" alone but to "extreme revisionism" or "ultra-revisionism".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: [https://books.google.de/books?id=xI_7uosa4FMC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=EMLqEHO3nI&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity] (2012), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregor Schoeler]] discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: "To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schoeler, ''Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen Überlieferung über das Leben Mohammeds'', de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: "dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance comes partly from older academics who still live in their thoughts in the world of the Islamic legends.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/rezensionen/rezension-tilman-nagel-eine-sackgasse-ohlig/ Review of: Mohammed. Leben und Legende, by Tilman Nagel], in:  imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] in his famous work [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962) described, a new paradigm prevails in academia often not by convincing current academics but by convincing the next generation of academics.

Continuous resistance against the new paradigm comes from researchers who fundamentally reject the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. They argue that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too. Adherents of Revisionism doubt whether this still is a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam ==
{{POV check|section|date=October 2016}}
The [[relationship between religion and science]] had always been shaped by conflicts...{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} It is always a hurting process for every religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself;{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious [[reform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion (2010) pp. 292 f. - Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;

By nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/wissenschaftliches-arbeiten-in-der-islamwissenschaft/ Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft], in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):
* As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[Patricia Crone]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], [[Fred Donner]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[Günter Lüling]].
* As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[John Wansbrough]], [[Hans Jansen]], [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]], [[Yehuda D. Nevo]].

Besides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:&lt;ref&gt;Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;
* Traditional texts which had shaped Islam for centuries - yet ''not'' from the beginning - are not true.
* The Quranic text has not been handed down to our times unchanged.
* Even in the Quran, God's word is in many respects clothed in human words.
* Muhammad did not live in Mecca.
* The relationship between Muhammad and Jews and Christians was different than always thought it had been.

==Revisionism by non-specialists==
[[Ibn Warraq]], an author known for his criticism of Islam, has complied several revisionist essays in his book, ''[[The Quest for the Historical Muhammad (Ibn Warraq)|The Quest for the Historical Muhammad]].'' [[Fred Donner]], reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough school of revisionism, the author presents a "one-sided selection" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The results is "a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader."&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-middle-east-studies/article/the-quest-for-the-historical-muhammad-edited-and-translated-by-warraqibn-554-pages-glossary-list-of-tribes-and-individuals-chronology-amherst-ny-prometheus-books-2000-3495-cloth-isbn-1-57392-787-2/4C3D7FD138EF645D933ADDB0BCB33D6B Review of: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, by Ibn Warraq],  Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, 35(1), pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], in this book ''Did Muhammad Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam's Obscure Origins,'' advances the thesis that Islam was a state-religion created by the [[Abbasids]] to justify the empire.

'''Solidarity – Scotland's Socialist Movement''' is a [[List of political parties in Scotland|political party]] in [[Scotland]].  The party launched on 3 September 2006, founded by two Scottish Socialist Party MSPs, [[Tommy Sheridan]] and [[Rosemary Byrne]], in the aftermath of Sheridan's [[Sheridan v News International|libel action]].

On 23 December 2010, Tommy Sheridan was convicted of perjury during the 2006 defamation action, and sentenced to three years imprisonment on 26 January 2011. Solidarity performed poorly in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011|2011 Scottish Parliament election]], achieving only 2,837 votes or 0.14% of the overall regional list vote.

==History==
The Scottish Socialist Party returned six MSPs in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2003|2003 Scottish Parliament election]]. At the end of August 2006, the SSP's leader Tommy Sheridan and Rosemary Byrne, a SSP MSP for South of Scotland led a breakaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5297040.stm |title=New socialist party for Sheridan |work=BBC News |date=29 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solidarity launched on 3 September with 600 people attending the first meeting in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12428085.Solidarity_wins_on_decibel_count_But_SSP_defeats_Sheridan_apos_s_new_party_for_vitriol_levels/|title=Solidarity wins on decibel count but SSP defeats Sheridan's new party for vitriol levels |first=Douglas |last=Fraser |work=The Herald|date=4 September 2006|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5307316.stm|title=Sheridan unveils Solidarity party |work=BBC News |date=3 September 2006|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most SSP members and branches in the Highlands and Islands defected to the new party, while the Shetland membership voted unanimously to stay in the SSP.&lt;ref name="Herald 18Sep2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12421982.Police__probe_transfer_of_funds_to_Sheridan_apos_s_new_party/ |title=Police probe transfer of funds to Sheridan's new party |first=Robbie |last=Dinwoodie |work=The Herald |date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 250 people attended the founding conference on Saturday 5 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=10098 ''Socialist Worker Online'' - Solidarity founding conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new party was backed by the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] and [[Socialist Party Scotland]] (part of the [[Committee for a Workers' International]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/2006/453/index.html?id=pp2.htm | title=Solidarity: New socialist party launched in Scotland | work=The Socialist | date=7–13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups clashed at the first Solidarity conference on the political orientation of the party. After a close vote the interim title of "Solidarity - Scotland's Socialist Movement" was adopted as the name of the party, and Rosemary Byrne and Tommy Sheridan were unanimously endorsed as co-convenors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworld.net/eng/2006/11/07scotland.html ''Socialist World'' - Solidarity conference agrees to build a socialist party]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solidarityscotland.org/content/blogsection/1/2/10/80/ ''Solidarity Website'' - Solidarity Conference Elects Co-Convenors, Tommy Sheridan and Rosemary Byrne 4 November 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062314/http://www.solidarityscotland.org/content/blogsection/1/2/10/80/ |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party failed to win any seats in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliament election]]. The party won one council seat in [[Glasgow]] in [[Scottish local elections, 2007|local elections]], with Ruth Black taking the Craigton seat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12776314.River_City_continues_to_run_red/ |title=River City continues to run red |first=Stewart |last=Paterson |work=The Herald |date=5 May 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; then subsequently defected to Labour in December 2007 after Sheridan was charged with perjury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7154934.stm |title=Solidarity councillor defection |work=BBC News |date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They fielded a candidate in the [[Glasgow East by-election, 2008]] who came sixth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7524550.stm |title=Glasgow East result in full |work=BBC News |date=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Solidarity joined [[No to EU – Yes to Democracy]], a left-wing [[eurosceptic]] coalition for the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European Parliament elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solidarityscotland.org/content/view/604/66 http://www.solidarityscotland.org/content/view/604/66] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724110015/http://www.solidarityscotland.org/content/view/604/66 |date=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2009/03/10/exclusive-tommy-sheridan-to-stand-for-euro-elections-86908-21185994/ http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2009/03/10/exclusive-tommy-sheridan-to-stand-for-euro-elections-86908-21185994/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=17465 http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=17465]&lt;/ref&gt; which received 9,693 votes (0.9%) in Scotland. Sheridan stood for election to Westminster in 2010 under the [[Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition]] banner, winning 931 votes (2.9%) in [[Glasgow South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow South West]] and losing his deposit.

Ahead of the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011|2011 Scottish Parliament election]], Solidarity explored the possibility of coalition with [[George Galloway]]. In January Galloway had announced his intention to stand for Holyrood after failing to gain a seat at Westminster as a Respect party candidate in the May 2010 election. Solidarity did not field a candidate in the Glasgow region, lending support to Galloway, who stood as the Respect Party candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/14/george-galloway-scottish-politics-glasgow-holyrood |title=George Galloway is back in Scottish politics – let battle commence |first=Marianne |last=Taylor |work=The Guardian |date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solidarity performed poorly with a result of only 2,837 votes, or 0.14% of the regional vote, and won no seats in the Scottish Parliament. The party's issues were compounded when Solidarity leader Tommy Sheridan was convicted of perjury following a [[HM Advocate v Sheridan and Sheridan|12-week-long court case]] at the High Court in Glasgow, and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment on 26 January 2011. He was released in early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-16780740|title=Tommy Sheridan vows to clear name after release from jail|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of 2015, Solidarity faced its own split as Socialist Party Scotland withdrew its support for the party and said Sheridan had moved to the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/solidarity-faces-breakaway-over-tommy-sheridans-support-for-snp.120847613|title=Solidarity faces breakaway over Tommy Sheridan's support for SNP|date=17 March 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015|publisher=The Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party registered the name ''Hope Over Fear'' for the [[2016 Scottish parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gordon |first=Tom |date=11 October 2015 |title=Sheridan's Solidarity party registers name "Hope Over Fear" for 2016 election |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13839598.Sheridan_s_Solidarity_party_registers_name__quot_Hope_Over_Fear_quot__for_2016_election/ |newspaper=The Sunday Herald |accessdate=17 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solidarity fielded 40 candidates across Scotland's eight regional lists for the 2016 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36150369 |title=Holyrood 2016: Solidarity calls for new independence referendum |work=BBC News |date=28 April 2016 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 2016 elections the party received 14,333 votes (0.6% of the electorate) across all the regions and returned none of their candidates. However they gained the largest number of votes among the left wing parties in Scotland making them the third most supported pro-independence party in Scotland behind the SNP and Green Party

In June 2016, Sheridan resigned from his position as co-convener of the Solidarity, with councillor Pat Lee elected to replace him alongside Byrne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14551826.Sheridan_quits_as_Solidarity_leader_after_party_wins_0_6__of_Holyrood_vote/ |title=Sheridan steps aside as Solidarity leader after struggling party wins 0.6% of Holyrood vote |first=Paul |last=Hutcheon |work=Sunday Herald |date=12 June 2016 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/tommy-sheridan-quits-solidarity-role-to-focus-on-bringing-down-rupert-murdoch-1-4152181|title=Tommy Sheridan quits Solidarity role to focus on ‘bringing down Rupert Murdoch’|work=The Scotsman|date=11 June 2016|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party campaigned in favour of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union during the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;https://solidarity.scot/solidarity-only-standing-left-party-for-lexit/&lt;/ref&gt;

Solidarity did have an elected official in Scotland; councillor Pat Lee in [[South Lanarkshire]]. Lee was elected as an SNP councillor and defected to Solidarity in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=29 May 2015 |title=Clydesdale councillor leaves SNP for Solidarity |url=http://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/news/local-headlines/clydesdale-councillor-leaves-snp-for-solidarity-1-3787568 |newspaper=The Southern Reporter |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solidarity has been accused of using entryist tactics in [[North Lanarkshire]], with it being claimed that activists close to the party have infiltrated SNP branches in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=19 July 2015 |title=Fears over infiltration of Tommy Sheridan supporters in SNP|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13463776.Fears_over_infiltration_of_Tommy_Sheridan_supporters_in_SNP/ |newspaper=The Herald |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Solidarity's split from the SSP was beset by a number of controversies. In the immediate aftermath of Solidarity's launch, members of the SSP claimed that a transfer of funds from the account of the regional SSP to Solidarity was fraudulent.&lt;ref name="Herald 18Sep2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/pages/news%20stories/09_2006/shetland_socialists_call_in_cops.htm ''The Shetland News'' - Shetland socialists call in cops] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930234910/http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/pages/news%20stories/09_2006/shetland_socialists_call_in_cops.htm |date=30 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120913015854/http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/70399.html ''The Herald'' - Solidarity is cleared over funds ‘smear’]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/pages/news%20stories/09_2006/party_fraud_probe_still_ongoing.htm ''The Shetland News'' - Party fraud probe still ongoing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930233354/http://www.shetland-news.co.uk/pages/news%20stories/09_2006/party_fraud_probe_still_ongoing.htm |date=30 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Autumn 2006, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iww.org.uk/about/updates/061115-solidarity/index.html ''IWW website'' - Sheridan betrays his own workers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304133745/http://www.iww.org.uk/about/updates/061115-solidarity/index.html |date=4 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iww.org.uk/about/updates/061123-solidarity/index.html ''IWW Website'' - NUJ backs dispute with Sheridan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024032717/http://www.iww.org.uk/about/updates/061123-solidarity/index.html |date=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged that Sheridan and Byrne betrayed workers by ignoring their right of consultation about the impending redundancy of parliamentary staff, and unilaterally removing funding from the collective body which employed parliamentary staff.

A '''[[state (subnational)|state]] government''' is the [[government]] of a [[country subdivision]] in a [[federation|federal]] [[form of government]], which shares [[political power]] with the [[federal government|federal]] or [[central government|national government]]. A state government may have some level of political [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]], or be subject to the direct control of the federal government. This relationship may be defined by a [[constitution]].

The reference to "state" denotes country subdivisions which are officially or widely known as "states", and should not be confused with a "[[sovereign state]]". Provinces are usually divisions of unitary states. Their governments, which are also ''provincial governments'', are not the subject of this article.

The [[United States]] and [[Australia]] are the main examples of [[Federation|federal]] systems in which the term "state" is used for the subnational components of the federation. In addition, the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian provinces]] fulfil a similar role. The term for subnational units in non-English-speaking federal countries may also often be translated as "state", e.g. [[States of Germany]] (German ''Länder'').

==Australia==
{{main|States and territories of Australia}}
The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] is a [[Federation|federal]] nation with six states (and two mainland territories). [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution]] sets out the division of [[legislature|legislative]] power between the states and the Commonwealth (federal) government. The Commonwealth government is given a variety of legislative powers, including control of [[foreign policy]], [[taxation]] (although this cannot discriminate between states or parts of states), and regulation of interstate [[commerce]] and [[corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm Section 51 of the Australian Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014193759/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm |date=2011-10-14 }} at theamericanParliament website&lt;/ref&gt; Since the original ratification of the constitution, the [[High Court of Australia]] has settled a number of disputes concerning the extent of the Commonwealth's legislative powers, some of which have been controversial and extensively criticised; these included a dispute in 1982 over whether the Commonwealth was entitled to designate land for national heritage purposes under [[United Nations]] agreements,&lt;ref&gt;Barwick, Sir Garfield, [http://www.samuelgriffith.org.au/papers/html/volume6/v6chap1.htm A View of the External Affairs Power], Samuel Griffith Society&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous disputes over the extent of the Commonwealth's power over [[trade union]] and [[industrial relations]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Creighton, Breen |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2000/33.html |title=One Hundred Years of the Conciliation and Arbitration Power: A Province Lost?}} (2000) 24(3) Melbourne University Law Review 839.&lt;/ref&gt;

One difference between the Australian and [[United States]] models of federalism is that, in Australia, the Commonwealth Parliament has explicit constitutional power over [[marriage]] legislation; this has been a focal point for recent controversies over [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2001-02/02rn17.pdf The High Court and the Meaning of 'Marriage' in Section 51(xxi) of the Constitution], Australian Parliamentary Library&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government structure===
{{see also|Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|Premiers of the Australian states}}

Each state of Australia has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], who represents the [[Queen of Australia]] (currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]) and performs the ceremonial duties of a [[head of state]]. Every state also has a [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|parliament]]; most states have a [[bicameral]] parliament, except for [[Queensland]], where the upper chamber (the [[Legislative Council]]) was abolished in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/view/historical/historical.asp?area=council&amp;LIndex=6&amp;SubArea=presidents The Legislative Council of Queensland]{{Dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, Queensland Parliament website&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike their [[United States]] counterparts, Australian states have a [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary government; the head of government, known in each state as a [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]], is drawn from the  state parliament.

==India==
{{see also|List of States of India by type of legislature}}
In [[India]], the state governments are the level of governments below the central government. India is  a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic  with a Parliamentary system of government. The Republic is governed in terms of the Constitution. Sovereignty is shared between the centre and the state government, but the central government is given greater powers. The President is the constitutional head Executive of the Union. Real executive power vests in a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as head of government. The State resembles the federal system. In the states, the Governor is the head of Executive, but real executive power vests with the Chief Minister who heads the Council of Ministers. The judicial setup of the country is headed by the Chief justice, who presides over one of the largest judicial apparatus dispensing criminal, civil and all other forms of litigation. The government head of its legal wing is the Attorney General of India.

== Nigeria==
{{see also|States of Nigeria}}
In [[Nigeria]], States are constituent political entities, which shares sovereignty with the Federal Government of Nigeria. In the [[Nigerian constitution|Nigerian Constitution]] all powers not granted to the States are reserved to the Federal Government.

==Pakistan==
{{see also|Provincial Governments of Pakistan}}
In [[Pakistan]], the provincial governments are the level of government below the federal government. Pakistan is a Sovereign [[Islamic Republic]] and a unitary Parliamentary [[Multi-party system]] form of a [[Central government|National Government]].

==South Africa==
{{main|Provincial governments of South Africa}}
South Africa is divided into [[Provinces of South Africa|nine provinces]] which have their own elected governments. Chapter Six of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] describes the division of power between the national government and the provincial governments, listing those "functional areas" of government that are exclusively reserved to the provincial governments and those where both levels of government have concurrent powers; the remaining areas not listed are reserved to the national government. In areas where both levels have concurrent powers there is a complex set of rules in the event of a conflict between national and provincial legislation. Generally in such a case the provincial legislation prevails, but national legislation may prescribe standards and frameworks for provinces to follow, and may prevent provinces from adversely affecting national interests or the interests of other provinces. The functional areas in which the provincial governments have powers include agriculture, arts and culture, primary and secondary education, the environment and tourism, health, housing, roads and transport, and social welfare.

The provincial governments are structured according to a [[parliamentary system]] in which the executive is dependent on and accountable to the legislature. The unicameral [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]] is elected by [[party-list proportional representation]], and the legislature in turn elects one of its members as [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] to head the executive. The Premier appoints an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Executive Council]] (a cabinet), consisting of members of the legislature, to administer the various [[government department|departments]] of the provincial administration.

==United States==
{{Main|State law (United States)}}
{{See also|State governments of the United States}}
Under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], all governmental powers not granted to the [[Federal government of the United States]] nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

{{wiktionary|straight ticket}}
{{voting}}

'''Straight-ticket voting''' or '''straight-party voting''' is the practice of [[voting]] for every candidate that a [[political party]] has on a general election [[ballot]].  In general, straight-ticket voting was a very common occurrence until around the 1960s and 1970s.  Since that time, straight-ticket voting has declined in the United States among the general voting population; however, strong partisans (that is, strong party identifiers) have remained straight-ticket voters.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, Marjorie Randon. Party Politics in America 12th ed. 2007: Longman Classics in Political Science. Pages 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the parties, it was nearly impossible not to vote on a straight-party line vote. Voters would receive a colored ballot with that party's nominees on it.  A split-ticket vote would require two different colored ballots, which confused the voter.{{fact|date=August 2018}}  Often, the voter would choose a specific party, and vote for everyone from that party. Some states have had an option (sometimes known as a '''master lever''')&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/01/10/governor-backs-elimination-master-lever/x68o68mDu9AD1LOTJN5OlO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; to select "vote straight-ticket Democrat" and "vote straight-ticket Republican" that voters can check instead of voting for each race; states that do so include [[Alabama]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]]. West Virginia, Michigan, and Iowa abolished this practice in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, though Michigan's repeal was blocked by a federal judge due to discrimination issues in 2016 but was reinstated by the 6th Circuit Court and Supreme Court in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/07/21/federal-judge-blocks-michigan-ban-straight-party-voting/87392104/ Federal judge blocks Michigan ban on straight-party voting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/09/07/supreme-court-michigan-straight-ticket/1220941002/ Supreme Court keeps ban on Michigan straight-ticket voting]&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan voted to restore straight-ticket voting through a ballot proposal in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/michigan-voting-proposal-3-results/1885266002/&lt;/ref&gt; Texas's straight-ticket repeal will be effective in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/01/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-bill-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/ Gov. Abbott signs bill to eliminate straight-ticket voting beginning in 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Straight-ticket voting in individual states ==

The straight-ticket voting option differs slightly from state to state.

=== Michigan ===

General-election ballots in Michigan have three sections:

* The partisan section, which includes candidates for partisan offices;
* The non-partisan section, which includes candidates for judgeships, most municipal offices, and school boards; and
* The proposals section, which includes state and local ballot issues.

Voters in Michigan had long been able to vote a straight ticket or a split ticket (voting for individual candidates in individual offices).

Straight-ticket voting only involved the partisan section of the ballot, meaning that if an individual wished to vote in a non-partisan race or for or against a proposal, they had to cast those votes individually. One area in which this issue received attention was in races for the [[Michigan Supreme Court]]. All parties on the ballot can nominate candidates for Justice of the Supreme Court at their party conventions (2–3 months before the election for primary-eligible parties, or before the August primary for alternative parties which nominate only at conventions or county caucuses).  However, the races appear on the ballot in the nonpartisan section, meaning that a straight-ticket vote for either of these parties would not include a vote for that party's candidates for Supreme Court.

The [[Michigan Legislature]] passed and Governor [[Rick Snyder]] signed SB 13 on January 5, 2015, which repeals and abolishes straight-ticket voting in the state. This follows failed attempts to abolish it in 1964 and 2001-2002 after voter referenda repealing abolition. With a $5 million appropriation in SB 13, however, a voter referendum is no longer possible due to a constitutional prohibition on referenda on bills appropriating moneys by the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/05/snyder-signs-bill-eliminating-straight-ticket-voting/78302866/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2016/01/gov_rick_snyder_signs_bill_eli.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Michigan voters passed a ballot proposal that restored straight-ticket voting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/michigan-voting-proposal-3-results/1885266002/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Carolina ===

North Carolina had an option for voting "straight party" (using the term from an NC ballot) that did not include a vote for the President and Vice President of the United States, through the 2012 elections. A [[voter ID]] law enacted in 2013 abolished all straight-ticket voting in the state, and went into effect in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20130812/governor-mccrory-signs-popular-voter-id-law Governor McCrory Signs Popular Voter ID into Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v8.pdf NC General Assembly: SESSION LAW 2013-381]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill eliminating it was HB 589.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the former system, North Carolina made separate selections for the President/Vice President and the straight-party option.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://www.app.sboe.state.nc.us/enrs/samples/DURHAM/8GDURH03.pdf sample ballot from Precinct 3, Durham, North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; This idiosyncrasy on the North Carolina ballot was described by some as "a ballot flaw,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norden |first1=Lawrence |last2=Chen |first2=Margaret |title=How Bad is North Carolina’s Ballot Flaw? The Numbers Say, Pretty Bad. |date=October 21, 2008 |url=http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/archives/how_bad_is_north_carolinas_ballot_flaw_the_numbers_say_pretty_bad/ |publisher=brennancenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially resulting in voters failing to cast a vote for President and Vice President when doing so was their intent. It was introduced in the 1960s to shore up Democrats at the state level as Republicans were gaining strength at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Year's Butterfly Ballot |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/opinion/27mon2.html?ref=opinion |newspaper=Nytimes.com |date=October 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 presidential election, there was a 3.15% "undervote" (i.e. (total voter turnout - total votes for President and Vice President) / total voter turnout); in the 2004 presidential election, there was a 2.57% undervote. This means that in raw numbers, more than 92,000 North Carolina voters in the 2000 election turned out to vote but did not vote for president; similarly, in 2004, more than 75,000 North Carolina voters turned out to vote but not vote for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Institute for Southern Studies |title=Voting Rights Watch: Could confusing ballots swing the presidential election in NC? |date=October 20, 2008|url= http://southernstudies.org/facingsouth/2008/10/voting-rights-watch-could-confusing.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texas ===
[[File:Straight Party voting on Harris County, Texas ballot in 2008 (299101265).jpg|thumb|Straight-party option on Texas ballot in the 2008 general election]]
In Texas, a vote for a straight-party ticket casts votes for all party candidates in all races where the party is fielding a candidate and the voter is eligible to cast a vote, from the President/Vice President (or Governor) to the county constable or justice of the peace. On June 1, 2017, Governor [[Greg Abbott]] signed into law House Bill 25, which eliminates the straight-ticket voting option in Texas for all races beginning in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCullough|first1=Jolie|title=Gov. Abbott signs bill to eliminate straight-ticket voting beginning in 2020|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/01/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-bill-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/|website=TexasTribune.org|publisher=Texas Tribune, Inc.|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter, however, may vote a straight-party ticket and subsequently cast an individual vote in a particular race.  This may happen in cases where
#the voter's party did not field a candidate in a specific race, and the voter wants to cast a vote in that race for one of the candidates from another party, and/or
#the voter does not wish to support the party's candidate in a specific race, but wishes to vote for another candidate in that race.  (However, Texas does not have a "none of the above" option; in a case where a voter wishes not to vote for any candidate in a race where his/her party is fielding one, the voter must cast a vote in each individual race separately and cannot choose the straight-party option.)  An individual vote will override the straight-party vote, but only in those specific races where an individual vote is cast.

Straight-party voting is only available in the general election for partisan elections.  It is not available for:
*party primary elections
*non-partisan races (such as City Council or School Board elections); even if a slate of candidates is endorsed by a particular group the slate cannot be elected on a single ticket, each candidate must be selected individually.
*ballot issues (such as an amendment to the [[Texas Constitution]] or a measure to approve bonds and assess taxes for their repayment), even if a political party officially endorses or opposes such an amendment.

In those cases where a partisan election is combined with a non-partisan election and/or ballot issues, the voter can vote straight-party in the partisan portion, but then must vote individually in the other portion(s).&lt;ref&gt;Texas Election Code, Section 52.071&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Virginia ===

In West Virginia, voting "straight party" included a vote for all candidates of the party voters selected, including the President and Vice President of the United States. Non-partisan candidates had to be voted separately. In 2015, however, straight-ticket voting was eliminated as an option on ballots through an Act of the State Legislature signed by Governor [[Earl Ray Tomblin]], SB 249.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
The [[Seneca Nation of Indians]], which operates under a republican form of government on reservations within the bounds of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], offers a straight-ticket voting option. To qualify, a political party must field candidates in each seat up for election in a given year. In practice, only the Seneca Party, which has been the [[dominant-party system|dominant party]] in the nation's politics for decades, has ever received the straight-ticket option. Opponents of the Seneca Party have accused the party of using the straight-ticket option to eavesdrop on voters and punish them with the loss of their jobs if they do not use it, also using the promise of jobs to those running in opposing parties to get them to drop out and deny those parties the straight-ticket option.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rick (October 26, 2016). [http://www.salamancapress.com/news/j-c-seneca-seeks-seneca-nation-presidency-again/article_7a699e4c-9a2c-11e6-a6d8-6bb82d32b950.html J.C. Seneca seeks Seneca Nation presidency again].

This is a timeline of the background of the '''Taliban's rise to power'''.

It details the [[Taliban]] movement's origins in [[Pashtun nationalism]], and briefly relates its ideological underpinnings with that of broader Afghan society.

It details the Taliban's consolidation of power, listing persecutions by the Taliban officials during its five years in power in Afghanistan and during its war with the [[Northern Alliance]].

==Contact with Pakistan's ISI==
During the power vacuum created by the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan]] in 1989, the country was torn apart by warring [[mujahideen]] groups and the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] of Pakistan grasped the chance to wield power in the region by fostering a previously unknown [[Kandahar]]i student movement.&lt;ref name="telegraphgodfathers"&gt;{{cite news

Taliban initially enjoyed enormous good will from Afghans weary of the corruption, brutality, and the incessant fighting of [[Mujahideen]] warlords.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world / editor in chief, Richard C. Martin, Macmillan Reference USA : Thomson/Gale, c2004&lt;/ref&gt; One story is that the rape and murder of boys and girls from a family traveling to Kandahar or a similar outrage by Mujahideen bandits sparked [[Mohammed Omar]] (Mullah Omar) and his students to vow to rid Afghanistan of these criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994-1997'', Oxford University Press, (1999), pp.25–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Another motivation was that the Pakistan-based truck shipping mafia known as the "Afghanistan Transit Trade" and their allies in the Pakistan government, trained, armed, and financed the Taliban to clear the southern road across Afghanistan to the Central Asian Republics of extortionate bandit gangs.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), 25-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many senior leaders of the Afghanistan [[Taliban]] were closely associated with and had attended the [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]] seminary in [[Akora Khattak]] in Pakistan, including [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], and its role in supporting the Taliban.&lt;ref name="jamestown"&gt;{{FIL-Luge link

==Allegations of connection to 'The West' or to the United States (CIA)==
{{See also|Allegations of CIA assistance to Osama bin Laden}}
After [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)#Soviet intervention and withdrawal|the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979]], Islamic [[mujahideen]] fighters engaged in war with those Soviet forces. Some of those Islamic fighters would later transform into the [[Taliban]] according to Professor [[Carole Hillenbrand]] who stated: "The West helped the Taliban to fight the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hillenbrand|2015|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there isn't any evidence that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] directly supported the Taliban or [[Al Qaeda]], some basis for military support of the Taliban was provided when, in the early 1980s, the CIA and the ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency) provided arms to Afghans resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the ISI assisted the process of gathering radical Muslims from around the world to fight against the Soviets.&lt;ref name='R000321'&gt;{{cite news | first=Joseph | last=Fitchett | coauthors= | title=What About the Taliban's Stingers? | date=26 September 2001 | publisher= | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/news/what-about-the-talibans-stingers.html | work=[[The International Herald Tribune]] | pages= | accessdate=2008-11-11 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017145308/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/news/what-about-the-talibans-stingers.html | archivedate=17 October 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama Bin Laden]] was one of the key players in organizing training camps for the foreign Arab volunteers, although his organization, [[Maktab al-Khidamat]], was exclusively Saudi funded.&lt;ref name=DID-THE-US-CREATE-OSAMA-BIN-LADEN&gt;{{cite web|title=Did the U.S. "Create" Osama bin Laden? |date=2005-01-14 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html |accessdate=2007-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html |archivedate=March 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BERGEN-BIN-LADEN-CIA-LINKS-HOGWASH&gt;{{Cite news

The Taliban were based in the [[Helmand Province|Helmand]], [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], and [[Uruzgan Province|Uruzgan]] regions and were overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns and predominantly [[Durrani]] Pashtuns.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence in Afghanistan==
The first major military activity of the Taliban was in October–November 1994 when they marched from [[Maywand District|Maiwand]] in southern Afghanistan to capture [[Kandahar|Kandahar City]] and the surrounding provinces, losing only a few dozen men.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'', (2000) pp.27–9&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the capture of a border crossing and a huge ammunition dump from warlord [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], a few weeks later they freed "a convoy trying to open a trade route from Pakistan to Central Asia" from another group of warlords attempting to extort money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/taliban.html |title=The Taliban — |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next three months this hitherto "unknown force" took control of twelve of Afghanistan's 34 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provinces]], with Mujahideen warlords often surrendering to them without a fight and the "heavily armed population" giving up their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1996 they had captured Afghanistan's capital, [[Kabul]].

==Consolidation of power==
Under the Taliban regime, [[Sharia law]] was interpreted to ban a wide variety of activities hitherto lawful in Afghanistan: employment, education and sports for women, movies, television, videos, music, dancing, hanging pictures in homes, clapping during sports events, kite flying, and beard trimming. One Taliban list of prohibitions included: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;pork, pig, pig oil, anything made from human hair, satellite dishes, cinematography, and equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computers, VCRs, television, anything that propagates sex and is full of music, wine, lobster, nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Waldman, `No TV, no Chess, No Kites: Taliban's Code, from A to Z,` ''New York Times'', 22 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Wikiquote|religious police}}

Men were required to have a beard extending farther than a fist clamped at the base of the chin. On the other hand, they had to wear their head hair short. Men were also required to wear a head covering.&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8222.htm |title=US Country Report on Human Rights Practices - Afghanistan 2001 |publisher=State.gov |date=2002-03-04 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possession was forbidden of depictions of living things, whether drawings, paintings or photographs, stuffed animals, and dolls.&lt;ref name="cr" /&gt;
 
These rules were issued by the [[Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Afghanistan)|Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Suppression of Vice]] (PVSV) and enforced by its "religious police," a concept thought to be borrowed from the [[Wahhabi]]s. In newly conquered towns hundreds of religious police beat offenders (typically men without beards and women who were not wearing their burqas properly) with long sticks.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

Theft was punished by the amputation of a hand, rape and murder by public execution. Married adulterers were stoned to death. In Kabul, punishments were carried out in front of crowds in the city's former [[soccer stadium]].

===Treatment of women===
{{main|Taliban treatment of women}}
[[File:Taliban beating woman in public RAWA.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A member of the Taliban's [[Mutaween#Other groups|religious police]] beating a woman in [[Kabul]] on 13 September 2001. The footage, which was filmed by [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan|RAWA]].]]
Women in particular were targets of the Taliban's restrictions. They were prohibited from working; from wearing clothing regarded as "stimulating and attractive," including the "Iranian [[chador]]," (viewed as insufficiently complete in its covering); from taking a taxi without a "close male relative" (''[[mahram]]''); washing clothes in streams; or having their measurements taken by tailors.&lt;ref name="Rashid218"&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), pp.218–9. See the full edict here: [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/taliban_in_their_own_words.html The Taliban In Their Own Words]&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment of women was restricted to the medical sector because male medical personnel were not allowed to examine women.  One result of the Taliban's ban on employment of women was the closing down of many primary schools, in places such as Kabul, not only for girls but for boys too, because almost all the teachers there were women.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also not permitted to attend co-educational schools; in practice, this prevented the vast majority of young women and girls in Afghanistan from receiving even a [[primary education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7799926.stm | work=BBC News | title=Taleban 'will kill school girls' | date=26 December 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s1oWlA3xeg |title=Taliban Threatening girls again |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were made to wear the [[burqa]], a traditional dress covering the entire body, with a small screen covering the face through which the wearer could see. Taliban restrictions became more severe after they took control of the capital. In February 1998, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering "householders to blacken their windows, so women would not be visible from the outside."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; 
Home schools for girls, which had been allowed to continue, were forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, the Taliban stopped all women from attending general hospitals,&lt;ref name=taliban71&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the use of one all-women hospital in Kabul. There were many reports of Muslim women being beaten by the Taliban for violating the Taliban interpretation of the [[Sharia]].

=== Prohibitions on culture ===
[[Movie theater]]s were closed and music was banned. Hundreds of cultural artifacts that were deemed [[polytheistic]] were also destroyed including a major museum and countless private art collections.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample Taliban edict issued after their capture of Kabul is one decreed in December 1996 by the "General Presidency of Amr Bil Maruf and Nahi Anil Munkar" (or Religious Police) banning a variety of things and activities: music, shaving of beards, keeping of pigeons, flying kites, displaying of pictures or portraits, western hairstyles, music and dancing at weddings, gambling, "sorcery," and not praying at prayer times.&lt;ref name="Rashid218" /&gt; In February 2001, Taliban used sledgehammers to destroy representational works of art at the National Museum of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=loomingtowers337&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local festivities were not exempt from prohibitions. The Taliban banned the traditional Afghan New Year's celebrations and "for a time they also banned [Ashura] the Shia Islamic month of mourning and even restricted any show of festivity at [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]]."&lt;ref name="Rashid115"&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban,'' (2000), pp.115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Afghan people were not allowed to have any cultural celebrations if  women were present. If there were only men at the celebration it would be allowed, so long as it ended by  7:00 p.m, a set time.

Many Taliban officials wanted to give entertain or said they did but they wanted it to be set by them and guided by the holy religion.

====Buddhas of Bamiyan====
{{Main|Buddhas of Bamiyan}}

In March 2001, the Taliban ordered the demolition of two statues of [[Buddharupa|Buddhas]] carved into cliffsides at [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan]], one 38 metres (125&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and carved in 507 CE, the other 53 metres (174&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and carved in 554 CE. The act was condemned by [[UNESCO]] and many countries around the world.

The intentions of the destruction remain unclear. Mullah Omar initially supported the preservation of Afghanistan's [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], and [[Japan]] linked financial aid to the preservation of the statues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pakistan and Japan plead for Afghan statues | date=2001-03-09 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/09/afghanistan.destruction/ | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | accessdate=2007-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a few years, a [[decree]] was issued claiming all representations of humans and idols, including those in museums, must be destroyed in accordance with Islamic law which prohibits any form of [[idolatry|idol worship]].

The government of Pakistan (itself host to one of the richest and most ancient collections of Buddhist art) implored the Taliban to spare the statues. Saudi Arabia and the [[United Arab Emirates]] later denounced the act as savage.

[[Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi]], a senior representative of the Taliban designated as the roving [[Ambassador]], visited the US in March, 2001. He portrayed the Taliban's action not as an act of irrationality, but as an act of rage over UNESCO and some western governments denying the Taliban use of the funds meant for the repairs of the war-damaged statues of the Buddha. He contended that the Taliban intended to use the money for drought relief.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.robert-fisk.com/taliban_lecture.htm Transcript] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025030742/http://www.robert-fisk.com/taliban_lecture.htm |date=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Taliban spent much money and effort on destroying the statues, resources which they could have instead used for drought relief.

===Ethnic massacres and persecution===
The worst attack on civilians came in summer of 1998 when the Taliban swept north from [[Herat]] to the predominantly Hazara and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] city of [[Mazari Sharif|Mazar-i-Sharif]], the largest city in the north. Entering at 10 am on 8 August 1998, for the next two days the Taliban drove their pickup trucks "up and down the narrow streets of Mazar-i-Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that moved — shop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 8000 noncombatants  were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in [[Bamiyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, ''Afghanistan's Endless War,'' (2001), p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immediate burial, the Taliban forbade anyone to bury the corpses for the first six days while they rotted in the summer heat and were eaten by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-02.htm#P114_24041 THE MASSACRE IN MAZAR-I SHARIF, THE FIRST DAY OF THE TAKEOVER].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this indiscriminate slaughter, the Taliban sought out and [[massacre]]d members of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]], a mostly Shia ethnic group, while in control of Mazar-i-Sharif.

While the slaughter can be attributed to several factors – ethnic difference, suspicion of Hazara loyalty to their co-religionists in Iran, fury at the loss of life suffered in an earlier unsuccessful Taliban takeover of Mazar – the belief by some [[Sunni]] Taliban that the [[Shia]] Hazaras were guilty of ''[[takfir]]'' (apostasy) may have been the principal motivation. It was expressed by Mullah Niazi, the commander of the attack and governor of Mazar after the attack, in his declaration from Mazar's central mosque:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now we have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.&lt;ref name = "hrw.org-Niazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364 |title=Human Rights Watch Report, `Afghanistan, the massacre in Mazar-e-Sharif`, November 1998. INCITEMENT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST HAZARAS BY GOVERNOR NIAZI |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazara also suffered a [[siege]] by the Taliban of their [[Hazarajat]] homeland in central Afghanistan and the refusal by the Taliban to allow the UN to supply food to Hazara in the provinces of Bamiyan, [[Ghor]], [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]] and [[Ghazni]].&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.68&lt;/ref&gt; A month after the Mazar slaughter, Taliban broke through Hazar lines and took over Hazarajat. The number of civilians killed was not as great as in Mazar, but occurred nevertheless.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years that followed, massacres of Hazara by Taliban forces were documented by groups such as [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/ |title=Afghanistan |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conscription===
{{main|Taliban conscription}}
According to the testimony of [[Guantanamo captive]]s before their [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its [[civil service]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

'''Totalitarianism''' is a political concept of a mode of government which prohibits opposition parties, restricts individual opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high degree of control over public and private life. It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of [[authoritarianism]]. [[Political power]] in totalitarian states has often been held by [[Dictatorship|rule by one leader]] which employ all-encompassing [[propaganda]] campaigns broadcast by state-controlled [[mass media]]. Totalitarian regimes and are often marked by [[political repression]], [[personality cultism]], [[Command economy|control over the economy]], [[censorship|restriction of speech]], [[mass surveillance]] and widespread use of [[state terrorism]]. Historian Robert Conquest describes a "totalitarian" state as one recognizing no limits to its authority in any sphere of public or private life and which extends that authority to whatever length feasible.&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first developed in the 1920s by both [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] jurist (and later [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] academic) [[Carl Schmitt]] and, concurrently, by the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]]. Italian fascist [[Benito Mussolini]] said "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state". Schmitt used the term ''Totalstaat'' in his influential 1927 work on the legal basis of an all-powerful state, ''[[The Concept of the Political]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Schmitt|date=1927|title=The Concept of the Political (German: Der Begriff des Politischen)|isbn=0-226-73886-8|edition=1996 University of Chicago Press|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the concept was used extensively to [[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism|compare Nazism and Stalinism]].  The Economist has described [[China]]'s recently developed [[Social Credit System|social credit system]] to screen and rank its citizens based on their personal behavior as "totalitarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/12/17/china-invents-the-digital-totalitarian-state |title=China invents the digital totalitarian state |last= |date=17 December 2017 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4|title=China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system — here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/china-experiments-with-sweeping-social-credit-system/a-42030727|title=China experiments with sweeping Social Credit System |date=4 January 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian regimes are different from other [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian ones]]. The latter denotes a state in which the single power holder – an individual "[[dictator]]", a committee or a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] or an otherwise small group of political elite – monopolizes political power. "[The] authoritarian state [...] is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarianism "does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; In contrast, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life, including the economy, education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens. Some totalitarian governments may promote an elaborate ideology: "The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens".&lt;ref name="regime"/&gt; It also mobilizes the whole population in pursuit of its goals. [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of [...] industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

==Early concepts and use==
The notion of totalitarianism as a "total" political power by the state was formulated in 1923 by [[Giovanni Amendola]], who described [[Italian Fascism]] as a system fundamentally different from conventional [[dictatorship]]s.&lt;ref name="regime"&gt;* {{citation| author =Richard Pipes | author-link =Richard Pipes | publication-date = | year =1995 | title = Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime | place =New York | publisher =Vintage Books, Random House Inc. | isbn =0394502426 | page =243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later assigned a positive meaning in the writings of [[Giovanni Gentile]], Italy’s most prominent philosopher and leading theorist of [[fascism]]. He used the term ''totalitario'' to refer to the structure and goals of the new state, which were to provide the "total representation of the nation and total guidance of national goals".&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G., ''Fascism: Comparison and Definition'' (UW Press, 1980), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He described totalitarianism as a society in which the ideology of the state had influence, if not power, over most of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Giovanni and Benito Mussolini in "La dottrina del fascismo" (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benito Mussolini]], this system politicizes everything spiritual and human: "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state".&lt;ref name="regime"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'' (Oxford University Press, 1990) {{ISBN|0-19-507132-8}}, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first to use the term "totalitarianism" in the English language was the Austrian writer [[Franz Borkenau]] in his 1938 book ''The Communist International'', in which he commented that it united the Soviet and German dictatorships more than it divided them.&lt;ref&gt;Nemoianu, Virgil, "Review of ''End and Beginnings''" pp. 1235–38 from MLN, Volume 97, Issue #5, December 1982, p.1235.&lt;/ref&gt; The label "totalitarian" was twice affixed to the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]] during [[Winston Churchill]]'s speech of October 5, 1938&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/the-munich-agreement Speech to the House of Commons, October 5, 1938]: "We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries, have a perfect right to exalt the principle of self-determination, but it comes ill out of the mouths of those in totalitarian states who deny even the smallest element of toleration to every section and creed within their bounds."

"Many of those countries, in fear of the rise of the Nazi power, ... loathed the idea of having this arbitrary rule of the totalitarian system thrust upon them, and hoped that a stand would be made."&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in opposition to the [[Munich Agreement]], by which France and Great Britain consented to [[Nazi Germany]]'s annexation of the [[Sudetenland]]. Churchill was then a [[backbencher]] MP representing the [[Epping (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping constituency]]. In a radio address two weeks later, Churchill again employed the term, this time applying the concept to "a Communist or a Nazi tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/the-defence-of-freedom-and-peace Radio Broadcast to the United States and to London, October 16, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the historic Spanish [[reactionary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |date=2004 |title=Fascists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTE7ytbtp_cC |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=331 |isbn=9780521831314 |author-link=Michael_Mann_(sociologist) }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservatism|conservative]] party called the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] declared his intention to "give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity" and went on to say: "[[Democracy]] is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either [[Cortes Generales|parliament]] submits or we will eliminate it".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Preston. ''The Spanish Civil War: reaction, revolution and revenge''. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York: Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 pp. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] made frequent use of the word totalitarian and its cognates in multiple essays published in 1940, 1941 and 1942. In his essay ''[[Why I Write]]'', he wrote: "The [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish war]] and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for [[democratic socialism]], as I understand it".&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300011h.html#part47 "Why I Write"], Gangrel (Summer) 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'' (published as a book in 1946), the pro-Soviet British historian [[E. H. Carr]] claimed: "The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable" and that [[Marxism–Leninism]] was by far the most successful type of totalitarianism as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the [[Red Army]]'s role in defeating Germany. Only the "blind and incurable" could ignore the trend towards totalitarianism, said Carr.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution'', New York: Scribner, 1987, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' (1961), [[Karl Popper]] articulated an influential critique of totalitarianism: in both works, he contrasted the "open society" of [[liberal democracy]] with totalitarianism and argued that the latter is grounded in the belief that history moves toward an immutable future in accordance with knowable laws.

In ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] argued that [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Communism|Communist]] regimes were new forms of government and not merely updated versions of the old [[tyrannies]]. According to Arendt, the source of the mass appeal of totalitarian regimes is their [[ideology]], which provides a comforting, single answer to the mysteries of the past, present and future. For Nazism, all history is the history of [[race struggle]] and for [[Marxism]] all history is the history of [[class struggle]]. Once that premise is accepted, all actions of the state can be justified by [[appeal to nature]] or the [[Historicism|law of history]], justifying their establishment of authoritarian state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Richard Villa (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hannah Arendt''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|0-521-64571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Arendt, many scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds and ideological positions have closely examined totalitarianism. Among the most noted commentators on totalitarianism are [[Raymond Aron]], Lawrence Aronsen, Franz Borkenau, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Robert Conquest]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], Eckhard Jesse, [[Leopold Labedz]], [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Juan Linz]], [[Richard Löwenthal]], Karl Popper, [[Richard Pipes]], [[Leonard Schapiro]] and [[Adam Ulam]]. Each one of these describes totalitarianism in slightly different ways, but they all agree that totalitarianism seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an official state ideology and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the state, entailing repression or state control of [[business]], [[labour union]]s, [[non-profit organizations]], religious organizations and buildings and [[political party|political parties]].

==Cold War anti-totalitarianism&lt;!--'Anti-totalitarianism', 'Antitotalitarianism', 'Anti-totalitarian', and 'Anti-totalitarian' redirect here--&gt;==
The concept became prominent in [[Western world|Western]] [[anti-communist]] political discourse during the [[Cold War]] era as a tool to convert pre-war [[anti-fascism]] into postwar anti-communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Brook|last=Defty|date=2007|title=Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda 1945–1953|publisher=The Information Research Department|others=Chapters 2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Achim Siegel, ''The totalitarian paradigm after the end of Communism: towards a theoretical reassessment'', 1998, p. 200 "Concepts of totalitarianism became most widespread at the height of the Cold War. Since the late 1940s, especially since the Korean War, they were condensed into a far-reaching, even hegemonic, ideology, by which the political elites of the Western world tried to explain and even to justify the Cold War constellation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Guilhot, ''The democracy makers: human rights and international order'', 2005, p. 33 "The opposition between the West and Soviet totalitarianism was often presented as an opposition both moral and epistemological between truth and falsehood. The democratic, social, and economic credentials of the Soviet Union were typically seen as "lies" and as the product of a deliberate and multiform propaganda...In this context, the concept of totalitarianism was itself an asset. As it made possible the conversion of prewar anti-fascism into postwar anti-communism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Caute, ''Politics and the novel during the Cold War'', 2009, pp. 95–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George A Reisch, ''How the Cold War transformed philosophy of science: to the icy slopes of logic'', 2005, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientists [[Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] were primarily responsible for expanding the usage of the term in university social science and professional research, reformulating it as a paradigm for the [[Soviet Union]] as well as [[fascist]] regimes. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that a totalitarian system has the following six, mutually supportive, defining characteristics:
# Elaborate guiding [[ideology]].
# [[one-party state|Single mass party]], typically led by a [[dictator]].
# [[state terrorism|System of terror]], using such instruments as violence and [[secret police]].
# Monopoly on weapons.
# Monopoly on the [[Mass media|means of communication]].
# Central direction and control of the economy through [[state planning]].

Totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]] and allowed totalitarian movements to seize control of the government while the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled them to effectively establish what Friedrich and Brzezinski called a "totalitarian dictatorship". Some [[Social science|social scientists]] have criticized Friedrich and Brzezinski's '''anti-totalitarian'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; approach, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 186–89, 233–34&lt;/ref&gt; These critics pointed to evidence of popular support for the regime and widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt, but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.

The German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the "totalitarian typology" as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model and failed to consider the "revolutionary dynamic" that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian "closed" understanding of politics from the "open" democratic understanding.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"/&gt; Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition, Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter'' The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The True Believer]]'', [[Eric Hoffer]] argues that mass movements like [[Stalinism]], [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]] had a common trait in picturing Western democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people "too soft, too [[Hedonism|pleasure-loving]] and too [[selfish]]" to [[sacrifice]] for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and "fact-proof screens from reality" are established.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), {{ISBN|0-06-050591-5}}, pp. 61, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later research==
In the 1990s, [[François Furet]] used the term "[[totalitarian twins]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Furet, borrowing from [[Hannah Arendt]], describes [[Bolshevik]]s and [[Nazism|Nazis]] as totalitarian twins, conflicting yet united." [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19950417/singer Singer, Daniel, ''The Nation'' (April 17, 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; to link [[Stalinism]]&lt;ref&gt;"The totalitarian nature of Stalin's Russia is undeniable." [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19991213/singer/3 Singer, Singer,''The Nation'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The government of [[Nazi Germany]] was a fascist, totalitarian state." [http://www.remember.org/guide/Facts.root.nazi.html Grobman, Gary M.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Hobsbawm]] criticized Furet for his temptation to stress a common ground between two systems of different ideological roots.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Hobsbawm (2012), ''Revolutionaries''. Abacus, Ch. 7. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of Soviet history, the totalitarian concept has been disparaged by the [[historical revisionism|revisionist]] school, some of whose more prominent members were [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], [[Jerry F. Hough]], William McCagg, [[Robert W. Thurston]] and [[J. Arch Getty]].&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227"&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225–27&lt;/ref&gt; Though their individual interpretations differ, the revisionists have argued that the Soviet state under [[Joseph Stalin]] was institutionally weak, that the level of terror was much exaggerated and that—to the extent it occurred—it reflected the weaknesses rather than the strengths of the Soviet state.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227"/&gt; Fitzpatrick argued that the Stalin's purges in the Soviet Union provided an increased social mobility and therefore a chance for a better life.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225, 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Sheila, ''Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1987, [[Walter Laqueur]] said that the revisionists in the field of Soviet history were guilty of confusing popularity with morality and of making highly embarrassing and not very convincing arguments against the concept of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian state.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 228"&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur argued that the revisionists' arguments with regard to Soviet history were highly similar to the arguments made by [[Ernst Nolte]] regarding German history.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 228"/&gt; Laqueur asserted that concepts such as modernization were inadequate tools for explaining Soviet history while totalitarianism was not.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laqueur's argument has been criticized by modern revisionist historians, such as [[Paul Buhle]], who claim that Laqueur wrongly equates Cold-war revisionism with the German revisionism. The latter reflected a "revanchist, military-minded conservative nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Buhle and Edward Francis Rice-Maximin (1995), ''William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire''. Psychology Press, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Enzo Traverso]] has attacked the creators of the concept of totalitarianism, who invented it to designate the enemies of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Enzo Traverso (2001), ''Le Totalitarisme: Le XXe siècle en débat''. Poche. {{ISBN|978-2020378574}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Domenico Losurdo]], totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]], and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[USSR]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research. Other scholars, such as [[F. William Engdahl]], [[Sheldon Wolin]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]], have linked totalitarianism to capitalism and liberalism and used concepts, such as [[totalitarian democracy]], [[inverted totalitarianism]] or [[totalitarian capitalism]].

In the 2010s, Vladimir Tismaneanu, Richard Shorten and Aviezer Tucker argued that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems, but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism and/or political violence. They think that both Nazism and Soviet Communism emphasised the role of specialisation in modern societies and saw [[polymathy]] as "a thing of the past"; both claimed to have statistical scientific support for their claims, which led to a strict "ethical" control of culture, psychological violence and persecution of entire groups.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten "Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present", Palgrave, 2012; Vladimir Tismaneanu, “The Devil in History: Communism, Fascism, and Some Lessons of the Twentieth Century”, University of California Press, 2012; Aviezer Tucker "The Legacies of Totalitarianism: A Theoretical Framework", Cambridge University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Their arguments have been criticised by other scholars due to their partiality and anachronism. For instance, Juan Francisco Fuentes treats totalitarianism as an “[[invented tradition]]” and the use of notion of “modern [[despotism]]” as a “reverse anachronism”. For Fuentes, “the anachronistic use of totalitarian/totalitarianism involves the will to reshape the past in the image and likeness of the present.”&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco Fuentes, “How Words reshape the Past: The ‘Old, Old Story’ of Totalitarianism”, Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalitarianism in architecture==
{{main|Totalitarian architecture}}
Non-political aspects of the culture and motifs of totalitarian countries have themselves often been labeled innately "totalitarian". For example, [[Theodore Dalrymple]], a British author, physician and political commentator, has written for ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'' that [[Brutalism|brutalist structures]] are an expression of totalitarianism given that their grand, concrete-based design involves destroying gentler, more-human places such as [[gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian|date=Autumn 2009|author=[[Theodore Dalrymple]]|publisher=''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, author [[George Orwell]] described the [[Ministry of Truth]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as an "enormous, pyramidal structure of white concrete, soaring up terrace after terrace, three hundred metres into the air". [[Columnist]] [[Ben Macintyre]] of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that it was "a prescient description of the sort of totalitarian architecture that would soon dominate the Communist bloc".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|title=Look on those monuments to megalomania, and despair|date=March 30, 2007|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=[[Ben Macintyre]]|accessdate=January 5, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829160102/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|archivedate=August 29, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of totalitarianism in architecture is the [[Panopticon]], a type of institutional building designed by English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late eighteenth century. The concept of the design is to allow a watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without their being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. It was invoked by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' as metaphor for "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
