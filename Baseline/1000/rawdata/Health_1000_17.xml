'''1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane''', ('''dibromochloropropane''') better known as '''DBCP''', is the active ingredient in the [[nematicide]] '''Nemagon''', also known as Fumazone.

It is a soil [[fumigant]] formerly used in American [[agriculture]]. In mammals it causes male sterility at high levels of exposure. After discovery of its deleterious health effects on humans, the compound was banned from use in 1979 by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/dibromo-.html Hazard Summary]. - [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. - EPA.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing presence of the chemical as a [[contaminant]] in [[ground water]] remains a problem for many communities for years after end of use.

== Uses ==
* Until 1977, DBCP was used as a soil [[fumigant]] and [[nematocide]] on over 40 different crops in the United States. It fights pests that attack the roots of fruit trees and boosts the weight of harvests by 20 percent.&lt;ref name=SpanoJ-LAT-2007-11-15&gt;Spano, John. - "Dole Must Pay $2.5 Million in Punitive Damages". - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. - November 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1979, EPA suspended registration for all DBCP-containing products except for use on pineapples in [[Hawaii]]. In 1985, EPA issued an intent to cancel all registrations for DBCP, including use on [[pineapple]]s. Subsequently, the use of existing stocks of DBCP was prohibited.
* DBCP is used as an intermediate in the [[synthesis of organic chemicals]].

== Sources and potential exposure ==
* Human exposure to DBCP could result from the ingestion of contaminated [[drinking water]] and food.
* Human exposure could also result from inhalation and / or skin contact with the product.
* In the past, release of DBCP to the environment occurred primarily from its fumigant and nematocide uses; because of the cancellation of all DBCP uses, environmental exposure is expected to decline with time.

== Examples of persistence ==
DBCP residues have persisted in [[soil contamination|contaminated soil]] and groundwater long after applications have ceased. For example, in agricultural areas around [[Turlock, California|Turlock]] in the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]] of California, DBCP was applied to crops in the 1970s. As late as 1989, DBCP persistence was reported in groundwater that was previously used for beneficial purposes, and numerous nearby [[water well|wells]] had to be shut down at that time.&lt;ref&gt;"Environmental Screening Analysis, Tully Road Properties, Turlock, California". - Earth Metrics Incorporated. - Report 7826, San Mateo, California. - March, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuits ==
Workers at the [[Dow Chemical]] plant producing DBCP were made [[Infertility|sterile]] by exposure to DBCP. These male reproductive effects were consistent with animal experiments showing that DBCP sterilizes rabbits. One contract worker at the production plant successfully sued the company. Most workers remained with the company and in a company sponsored medical program until the facility was sold in 1987. At that time, some of the workers did file suit against the company. However, the suit was denied due to [[statute of limitations]] issues.

Most domestic uses of the chemical were banned in 1977. Amid growing concerns over DBCP's effects on male workers, Dow ceased production and reclaimed DBCP that had been shipped to its users.

However, despite warnings from Dow about its health effects, the [[Dole Food Company]], which was using the chemical on its [[banana]] [[plantation]]s in [[Latin America]], threatened to sue Dow if it stopped DBCP shipments. Dow then shipped half a million gallons of DBCP to Dole, much of it reclaimed from other users. Plantation workers who became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued Dow and Dole in Nicaraguan courts, alleging that their ailments were caused by DBCP exposure. Under a special law that was passed specifically for DBCP litigation, the Nicaraguan courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded them over US$600 million in damages. When plaintiff lawyers tried to enforce one of those judgments in the United States, the U.S. District Court in Florida held that "the credible and unrefuted medical testimony in this case is that it is factually impossible for what is represented in the Judgment to have occurred," and that due process "do[es] not permit awarding damages in the face of clear scientific evidence of the absence of causation," or, as in this case, "with proof that [the defendants] are not at fault."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rttnews.com/1104848/u-s-court-refuses-to-enforce-nicaragua-judgment-against-dole-food-update.aspx "U.S. Court Refuses To Enforce Nicaragua Judgment Against Dole Food - Update"]. - ''[[rttnews.com]]''. - October 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of workers then filed lawsuits in the United States, and on November 5, 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded them US$3.2 million.&lt;ref name=SpanoJ-LAT-2007-11-06&gt;Spano, John. - [http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-dole6nov06,1,2105565.story "Dole must pay farmworkers $3.2 million"]. - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. - November 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 2010, that judgment was thrown out after the Court presiding over the case found that the claims were part of "a massive fraud perpetrated on the court".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/07/15/california-judge-dismisses-m-jury-award-dole-food-banana-workers-case/ "California judge dismisses $2.3M jury award against Dole Food Co. in banana workers case"]. - ''[[FoxNews.com]]''. - July 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 2009, a Los Angeles judge also threw out two similar cases against Dole and Dow Chemical due to fraud and extortion by lawyers in Nicaragua recruiting fraudulent plaintiffs to make claims against the company.&lt;ref name=HallmanB-TAL-2009-4-27&gt;Hallman, Ben. - [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202430211082&amp;amp;rss=newswire "Finding Plaintiffs Lawyers Committed Fraud, Judge Dismisses Tort Cases Against Dole and Dow Chemical"]. - ''[[The American Lawyer]]''. - April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling casts doubt on US$2 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] in judgments in similar lawsuits.&lt;ref name=KeatingG-Forbes-2009-4-24&gt;Keating, Gina. - [https://www.forbes.com/feeds/reuters/2009/04/24/2009-04-24T052809Z_01_N21503396_RTRIDST_0_BANANAS-UPDATE-2.html "Judge throws out Dole "bananeros" cases, citing fraud"]. - ''[[Forbes]]''. - April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], using the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], and claiming sterility, crimes against humanity, and [[genocide]], sued (in ''Abagninin v. AMVAC Chemical Corp.'' [No. 07-56326]), these manufacturers of DBCP: Amvac Chemical, [[Dow Chemical]], [[Shell Oil Company]], as well as [[Dole Food Company]], who used it on overseas crops, but never used it in Côte d'Ivoire. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled against the workers in September 2008, stating that the plaintiffs did not show that the defendants had "specific intent" to intend harm against the workers and the citizens of the country. To be found guilty of genocide the defendant must have knowingly set out to commit the offense.&lt;ref name=USCofA9thC-AvACC&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/40AB16BDDF8C33D9882574CD007E8677/$file/0756326.pdf?openelement ''Abagninin v. AMVAC Chemical Corp.'']. - [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. - September 24, 2008. - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WilliamsCJ-LAT-2008-09-24&gt;Williams, Carol J. - "Appeals Court Rules Against Ivory Coast Farm Workers". - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. - September 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
DBCP causes a dramatic decrease in male fertility, ranging from [[oligospermia]] (low sperm count) to [[azoospermia]] (lack of sperm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DDT exposure, work in agriculture, and time to pregnancy among farmworkers in California|journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|date = Dec 2008|issn = 1536-5948|pmc = 2684791|pmid = 19092487|pages = 1335–1342|volume = 50|issue = 12|doi = 10.1097/JOM.0b013e31818f684d|first = Kim G.|last = Harley|first2 = Amy R.|last2 = Marks|first3 = Asa|last3 = Bradman|first4 = Dana B.|last4 = Barr|first5 = Brenda|last5 = Eskenazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angak''' is a [[Hopi]] [[kachina]] spirit, represented by spirit dancers and a corresponding kachina doll figure, known to non-hopis as ''Longhair''.

==Spirit character==
Angak represents a healing and protective male figure.

==Dance representation==
The dance of this figure is slow.

==Figure representation==
The figure will have waist length black hair and a black beard to mid chest, and when represented as a carving will usually be taller than other kachinas by the same artist. The figure wears a full length white cape, showing only his right hand, which contains an evergreen bough, representative of his home in the sacred [[San Francisco Peaks]]. On the cape are symbols for rainclouds.

==Headdress==
The forward part of the headdress over the brow consists of yellow feathers, while the rear part contains a long pendant of feathers terminating in a raincloud symbol. (Feathers in the doll are carved.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">'''Autoerotic fatalities''' are accidental [[death]]s that occur during [[Autoeroticism|sexual self-stimulation]] when an apparatus, device or prop that is being employed to enhance pleasure causes the death.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; Researchers only apply the term to unintentional deaths resulting from solitary sexual activity, not [[suicide]] or acts with a partner.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of autoerotic fatalities in Western countries is around 0.5 per million inhabitants each year.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sauvageau, A. | year = 2014 | title = Current Reports on Autoerotic Deaths—Five Persistent Myths | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-013-0430-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autoerotic asphyxia]] is the leading cause. 70 to 80% of autoerotic deaths are caused by hanging, while 10 to 30% are attributed to plastic bags or chemical use. Both of these lead to [[autoerotic asphyxia]]. 5 to 10% are related to [[electrocution]], foreign body insertion, overdressing/body wrapping, or another atypical method.&lt;ref name="sauvageau2014" /&gt; Specific causes include the use of chemicals such as [[amyl nitrite]], [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], or [[nitrous oxide]], and props and tools such as knives, oversized dildos, ligatures or bags for asphyxiation, duct tape, electrical apparatus for shocks, water for self-immersion, fire-making equipment for self-immolation, or sharp, unhygienic or large fetishized objects. Male victims are much more likely to use a variety of devices during autoerotic behaviour than female victims.

The subject has been treated in two books, ''Autoerotic Fatalities'' by Hazelwood et al. (1983) and ''Autoerotic Asphyxiation: Forensic, Medical, and Social Aspects'' by Sheleg et al. (2006).

[[File:Model Balancing.jpg|right|thumb|A woman demonstrating the ability to balance]]
[[File:Wine glass tower.jpg|thumb|A [[waiter]] balancing wine glasses]]
In [[biomechanics]], '''balance''' is an ability to maintain the line of gravity (vertical line from [[centre of mass]]) of a body within the base of support with minimal postural sway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Shumway-Cook A, Anson D, Haller S |title=Postural sway biofeedback: its effect on reestablishing stance stability in hemiplegic patients|journal=Arch. Phys. Med. Rehabil.|year= 1988|volume= 69|pages= 395–400|pmid=3377664|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sway is the horizontal movement of the centre of gravity even when a person is standing still. A certain amount of sway is essential and inevitable due to small perturbations within the body (e.g., breathing, shifting body weight from one foot to the other or from forefoot to rearfoot) or from external triggers (e.g., visual distortions, floor translations). An increase in sway is not necessarily an indicator of dysfunctional balance so much as it is an indicator of decreased sensorimotor control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|author2=Madigan, Nussbaum|title=Effects of lumbar extensor fatigue and fatigue rate on postural sway|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|year=2004|issue=92|pages=183–189|pmid=15549370|doi=10.1007/s00421-004-1195-1|volume=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintaining balance requires coordination of input from multiple sensory systems including the [[vestibular system|vestibular]], [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]], and [[visual system]]s.&lt;ref name="Gribble2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gribble|author2=Hertel|title=Effect of Lower-Extremity Fatigue on Postural Control|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|year=2004|issue=4|pages=589–592|pmid=15083434|volume=85|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2003.06.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vestibular system: sense organs that regulate equilibrium ([[equilibrioception]]); directional information as it relates to head position (internal gravitational, linear, and angular acceleration)
* Somatosensory system: senses of [[proprioception]] and [[kinesthesia]] of joints; information from skin and joints (pressure and vibratory senses); spatial position and movement relative to the support surface; movement and position of different body parts relative to each other
* Visual system: Reference to verticality of body and head motion; spatial location relative to objects

The senses must detect changes of spatial orientation with respect to the base of support, regardless of whether the body moves or the base is altered. There are environmental factors that can affect balance such as light conditions, floor surface changes, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[drugs]], and [[ear infection]].

There are balance impairments associated with aging. Age-related decline in the ability of the above systems to receive and integrate [[Sense|sensory]] information contributes to poor balance in [[older adults]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schmitz, T. J. |year=2007|chapter= Examination of Sensory Function|editors= S. B. O’Sullivan &amp; T.J. Schmitz |title=Physical Rehabilitation|edition=5th |pages=121–157|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher= F. A. Davis Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the elderly are at an increased risk of [[Falling (accident)|falls]]. In fact, one in three adults aged 65 and over will fall each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |authors= National Center for Injury Prevention and Control|date=8 December 2010|title=Costs of Falls Among Older Adults|accessdate= 15 May 2011|url= https://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/fallcost.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of an individual standing quietly upright, the limit of stability is defined as the amount of postural sway at which balance is lost and corrective action is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7644574|year=1995|last1=Nichols|first1=DS|last2=Glenn|first2=TM|last3=Hutchinson|first3=KJ|title=Changes in the mean center of balance during balance testing in young adults|volume=75|issue=8|pages=699–706|journal=Physical therapy}} [http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/reprint/75/8/699.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
	  
Body sway can occur in all planes of motion, which make it an increasingly difficult ability to rehabilitate. There is strong evidence in research showing that deficits in postural balance is related to the control of medial-lateral stability and an increased risk of falling. To remain balanced, a person standing must be able to keep the vertical projection of their center of mass within their base of support, resulting in little medial-lateral or anterior-posterior sway. Ankle sprains are one of the most frequently occurring injuries among athletes and physically active people.  The most common residual disability post ankle sprain is instability along with body sway. Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed physiological limits. Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kilbreath SL, Raymond J, Refshauge KM | year = 2000 | title = The effect of recurrent ankle inversion sprain and taping on proprioception at the ankle | url = | journal = Med Sci Sports Exerc | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 10–5 | doi=10.1097/00005768-200001000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 40% of patients with ankle sprains suffer from instability and an increase in body sway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guskiewicz KM, Perrin DH | year = 1996 | title = Effect of orthotics on postural sway following inversion [[ankle sprain]]. | url = | journal = Journal of Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 326–331 | doi=10.2519/jospt.1996.23.5.326}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Injury to the ankle causes a proprioceptive deficit and impaired postural control.  Individuals with muscular weakness, occult instability, and decreased postural control are more susceptible to ankle injury than those with better postural control.

Balance can be severely affected in individuals with neurological conditions. People who suffer a [[stroke]] or [[spinal cord injury]] for example, can struggle with this ability. Impaired balance is strongly associated with future function and recovery after a stroke, and is the strongest predictor of falls.&lt;ref name="Lubetzki-Vilnai &amp; Kartin. (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lubetzki-Vilnai, A. |author2=Kartin, D.| year=2010| title=The effect of balance training on balance performance in individuals poststroke: a systematic review| journal=Journal of Neurologic Physical Therapy| volume=34 | pages=127–137 | doi=10.1097/NPT.0B013E3181EF764D|pmid=20716987|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another population where balance is severely affected is Parkinson's disease patients. A study done by Nardone and Schieppati (2006) showed that individuals with Parkinson's disease problems in balance have been related to a reduced limit of stability and an impaired production of anticipatory motor strategies and abnormal calibration.

Balance can also be negatively affected in a normal population through fatigue in the musculature surrounding the ankles, knees, and hips.  Studies have found, however, that muscle fatigue around the hips (gluteals and lumbar extensors) and knees have a greater effect on postural stability (sway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|first=B.S. |author2=Madigan, M.L. |author3=Nussbaum, M.A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Effects of lumbar extensor fatigue and fatigue rate on postural sway|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|year=2004|volume=93|pages=183–189|doi=10.1007/s00421-004-1195-1|pmid=15549370|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is thought that muscle fatigue leads to a decreased ability to contract with the correct amount of force or accuracy.  As a result, proprioception and kinesthetic feedback from joints are altered so that conscious joint awareness may be negatively effected.&lt;ref name="Gribble2004" /&gt;

==Balance training==
[[File:Balancing girl 2009.jpg|left|thumb|Balance]]
[[File:Plank on a pair of medicine balls.jpg|right|thumb|Balance Training]]
Since balance is a key predictor of recovery and is required in so many of our [[activities of daily living]], it is often introduced into treatment plans by [[physiotherapists]] and occupational therapists when dealing with geriatrics, patients with neurological conditions, or others whom they have determined it to be beneficial.

Balance training in [[stroke]] patients has been supported in the literature.&lt;ref name="Lubetzki-Vilnai &amp; Kartin. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammer et al.

==Functional balance assessments==
Functional tests of balance focus on maintenance of both static and dynamic balance, whether it involves a type of perturbation/change of CoM or during quiet stance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Susan |last1=O'Sullivan|first2=Thomas |last2=Schmitz|title=Physical Rehabilitation|year=2007|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|location=Philadelphia|pages=254–259|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardized tests of balance are available to allow allied health care professionals to assess an individual’s postural control. Some functional balance tests that are available are:
*'''[[Romberg's test|Romberg Test]]''': used to determine proprioceptive contributions to upright balance. Subject remains in quiet standing while eyes are open. If this test is not difficult enough, there is a Sharpened Romberg's test. Subjects would have to have their arms crossed, feet together and eyes closed. This decreases the base of support, raises the subject's center of mass, and prevents them from using their arms to help balance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Functional Reach Test''': measures the maximal distance one can reach forward beyond arm’s length while maintaining feet planted in a standing position.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''[[Berg Balance Scale]]''': measures static and dynamic balance abilities using functional tasks commonly performed in everyday life.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt; One study reports that the Berg Balance Scale is the most commonly used assessment tool throughout [[stroke rehabilitation]], and found it to be a sound measure of balance impairment in patients following a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Lisa|author2=Korner-Bitensky, Nicol|title=Usefulness of the Berg Balance Scale in Stroke Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review|journal=Physical Therapy|date=May 2008|volume=88|issue=5|pages=559–566|doi=10.2522/ptj.20070205|pmid=18292215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA)''': measures both static and dynamic balance using tasks testing balance and [[gait]].&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Timed Get Up and Go Test''': measures dynamic balance and mobility.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Balance Efficacy Scale''': self-report measure that examines an individual’s confidence while performing daily tasks with or without assistance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;

* '''BESS'''. The BESS (Balance Error Scoring System) is a commonly used way to assess balance. It is known as a  simple and affordable way to get an accurate assessment of balance, although the validity of the BESS protocol has been questioned. The BESS is often used in sports settings to assess the effects of mild to moderate head injury on one’s postural stability. The BESS tests three separate stances (double leg, single leg, tandem) on two different surfaces (firm surface and medium density foam) for a total of six tests. Each test is 20 seconds long, with the entire time of the assessment approximately 5–7 minutes. The first stance is the double leg stance. The participant is instructed to stand on a firm surface with feet side by side with hands on hips and eyes closed. The second stance is the single leg stance. In this stance the participant is instructed to stand on their non-dominant foot on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The third stance is the tandem stance. The participant stands heel to toe on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The fourth, fifth, and sixth stances repeat in order stances one, two, and three except the participant performs these stances on a medium density foam surface. The BESS is scored by an examiner who looks for deviations from the proper stances. A deviation is noted when any of the following occurs in the participant during testing: opening the eyes, removing hands from the hips, stumbling forward or falling, lifting the forefoot or heel off the testing surface, abduction or flexion of the hip beyond 30 degrees, or remaining out of the proper testing position for more than 5 seconds.

Concussion (or mild traumatic brain injury) have been associated with imbalance among sports participants and military personnel. Some of the standard balance tests may be too easy or time-consuming for application to these high-functioning groups, s. Expert recommendations have been gathered concerning balance assessments appropriate to military service-members.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D., Rupert, A. H., &amp; Legan, S. M. (2012).

==Quantitative (computerized) assessments==
Due to recent technological advances, a growing trend in balance assessments has become the monitoring of [[center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)]] (CoP), the reaction vector of center of mass on the ground, path length for a specified duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hof|year=2005|title=The condition for dynamic stability|journal=Journal of biomechanics|volume=38|pages=1–8|author2=A.L.|author3=Gazendam|author4=M.G.J|author5=Sinke|author6=W.E.|doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.03.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; With quantitative assessments, minimal CoP path length is suggestive of good balance. Laboratory-grade force plates are considered the "gold-standard" of measuring CoP. The NeuroCom Balance Manager (NeuroCom, Clackamas, OR, United States) is a commercially available dynamic [[posturography]] system that uses computerized software to track CoP during different tasks. These different assessments range from the sensory organization test looking at the different systems that contribute through sensory receptor input to the limits of stability test observing a participant's ankle range of motion, velocity, and reaction time. While the NeuroCom is considered the industry standard for balance assessments, it does come at a steep price (about $250,000).

Within the past 5 years research has headed toward inexpensive and portable devices capable of measuring CoP accurately. Recently, Nintendo's Wii balance board (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) has been validated against a force plate and found to be an accurate tool to measure CoP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark |year=2010|title=Validity and reliability of the Nintendo Wii balance board for assessment of standing balance|journal= Gait &amp; Posture|volume= 31|issue=3|pages= 307–310|author2=R.|author3=Bryant|author4=A.|author5=Pua|author6=Y.|author7=McCrory|author8=P.|author9=Bennell|doi=10.1016/j.gaitpost.2009.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is very exciting as the price difference in technology ($25 vs $10,000) makes the Wii balance board a suitable alternative for clinicians to use quantitative balance assessments. Other inexpensive, custom-built force plates are being integrated into this new dynamic to create a growing field of research and clinical assessment that will benefit many populations.
[[File:A Bowing in Art 1996.jpg|thumb| Fatigue's effect on balance]]

==Fatigue's effect on balance==
The complexity of balance allows for many confounding variables to effect a person's ability to stay upright. [[Fatigue (medical)]], causing central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, can indirectly result in the inability to remain upright. This is seen repeatedly in clinical populations (e.g. Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis). Another major concern regarding fatigue's effect on balance is in the athletic population. Balance testing has become a standard measure to help diagnose concussions in athletes, but due to the fact that athletes can be extremely fatigued has made it hard for clinicians to accurately determine how long the athletes need to rest before fatigue is gone, and they can measure balance to determine if the athlete is concussed. This can have devastating effects when looking at college and professional games where the athlete is depended upon by a community. So far, researchers have only been able to estimate that athletes need anywhere from 8–20 minutes of rest before testing balance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fox|year=2008|title=Return of postural control to baseline after anaerobic and aerobic exercise protocols|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=43|issue=5|pages=456–63|author2=Z.G.|author3=Mihalik|author4=J.P.|author5=Blakburn|author6=J.T.|author7=Battaglini|author8=C.L.|author9=Guskiewicz|author10=KM|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-43.5.456|pmid=18833307|pmc=2547864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nardone|year=1997|title=Fatigue effects on body balance|journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology/Electromyography and Motor Control|volume=105|issue=4|pages=309–320|author2=A|author3=Tarantola|author4=J|author5=Giordano|author6=A|author7=Schieppati|author8=M|doi=10.1016/S0924-980X(97)00040-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Susco|year=2004|title=Balance recovers within 20 minutes after exertion as measured by the Balance Error Scoring System|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=39|issue=3|pages=241–246|author2=T.M.|author3=McLeod|author4=T.C.V.|author5=Gansneder|author6=B.M.|author7=Shultz|author8=S.J.|pmc=522146|pmid=15496993}}&lt;/ref&gt; That can be a huge difference depending on the circumstances.

==Other factors influencing balance==
Age, gender,{{how|date=August 2014}} and height have all been shown to impact an individual’s ability to balance and the assessment{{by whom|date=August 2014}} of that balance.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Typically, older adults have more body sway with all testing conditions.&lt;ref name="Hageman, Leibowitz &amp; Blanke. (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hageman, Leibowitz &amp; Blanke| year=1995| title=Age and gender effects on postural control measures| journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation| volume=76 | pages=961–965 | doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(95)80075-1|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that older adults demonstrate shorter functional reach and larger body sway path lengths. Height also influences body sway in that as height increases, functional reach typically decreases.  However, this test is only a measure of anterior and posterior sway.  This is done to create a repeatable and reliable clinical balance assessment tool.&lt;ref name="Duncan, Pamela W., et al. (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Duncan, Pamela W.| year=1990| title=Functional reach: a new clinical measure of balance| journal=Journal of Gerontology| volume=45 | pages=192–197 | doi=10.1093/geronj/45.6.M192|issue=6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Cochrane Review found that specific types of exercise (such as gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercises; 3D exercises [e.g. Tai Chi] and combinations of these) can help improve balance in older adults. However, there was no or limited evidence on the effectiveness of general physical activities, such as walking and cycling, computer-based balance games and vibration plates.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Voluntary control of balance ==
While balance is mostly an automatic process, voluntary control is common. Active control usually takes place when a person is in a situation where balance is compromised. This can have the counter-intuitive effect of increasing postural sway during basic activities such as standing. One explanation for this effect is that conscious control results in over-correcting an instability and "may inadvertently disrupt relatively automatic control processes."{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} While concentration on an external task "promotes the utilization of more automatic control processes."&lt;ref name="McNevin, N. 2002"/&gt;

==Balance and dual-tasking==
Supra-postural tasks are those activities that rely on postural control while completing another behavioral goal, such as walking or creating a text message while standing upright. Research has demonstrated that postural stability operates to permit the achievement of other activities.&lt;ref name="Stoffregen, T. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoffregen T. |author2=Pagulayan R. |author3=Bardy B. |author4=Hettinger L. | year = 2000 | title = Modulating postural control to facilitate visual performance | url = | journal = Human Movement Science | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 203–20 | doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(00)00009-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, standing in a stable upright position is not at all beneficial if one falls as soon as any task is attempted.  In a healthy individual, it is believed that postural control acts to minimize the amount of effort required (not necessarily to minimize sway), while successfully accomplishing the supra-postural task.&lt;ref name="Stoffregen, T. 2000"/&gt;  Research has shown that spontaneous reductions in postural sway occur in response to the addition of a secondary goal.&lt;ref name="McNevin, N. 2002"&gt;"McNevin, N., Wulf, G. (2002)"{{cite journal|author=McNevin, N. |author2=Wulf, G.| year=2002| title=Attentional focus on supra-postural tasks affects postural control| journal=Human Movement Science| volume=21 | pages=187–202| doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(02)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McNevin and Wulf (2002) found an increase in postural performance when directing an individual’s attention externally compared to directing attention internally&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNevin N. |author2=Wulf G. | year = 2002 | title = Attentional focus on supra-postural tasks affects postural control | url = | journal = Human Movement Science | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 187–202 | doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(02)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, focusing attention on the effects of one’s movements rather than on the movement itself will boost performance.  This results from the use of more automatic and reflexive control processes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNevinEtAl2013" /&gt;  When one is focused on their movements (internal focus), they may inadvertently interfere with these automatic processes, decreasing their performance.  Externally focusing attention improves postural stability, despite increasing postural sway at times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It is believed that utilizing automatic control processes by focusing attention externally enhances both performance and learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Adopting an external focus of attention subsequently improves the performance of supra-postural tasks, while increasing postural stability.&lt;ref name="McNevinEtAl2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McNevin | first1 = N. | last2 = Weir | first2 = P. | last3 = Quinn | first3 = T. | doi = 10.1080/02701367.2013.762321 | title = Effects of Attentional Focus and Age on Suprapostural Task Performance and Postural Control | journal = Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 96–103 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23611013| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9239">'''Chronic care''' refers to [[health care|medical care]] which addresses pre-existing or long term illness, as opposed to [[acute care]] which is concerned with short term or severe illness of brief duration. [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic medical conditions]] include [[asthma]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[emphysema]], chronic [[bronchitis]], congestive heart disease, [[cirrhosis of the liver]], [[hypertension]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Without effective treatment chronic conditions may lead to [[disability]].

The incidence of chronic disease has increased as [[mortality rate]]s have decreased.&lt;ref name="chroncity"/&gt;  It is estimated that by 2030 half of the population of the USA will have one or more chronic conditions.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt;

Conditions, injuries and diseases which were previously fatal can now be treated with chronic care. Chronic care aims to maintain wellness by keeping [[symptom]]s in [[remission (medicine)|remission]] while balancing treatment regimes and [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name="chroncity"/&gt;  Many of the core functions of [[primary health care]] are central to chronic care.&lt;ref name="mtcoci"&gt;{{cite book |title=Meeting the Challenge of Chronic Illness |last=Kane |first=Robert L. |author2=Reinhard Priester |author3=Annette M.

==Policy making==
According to 2008 figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chronic medical care accounts for more than 75% of health care spending in the US.&lt;ref name="chroncity"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chronicity |title=Chronic Illness: Impact and Intervention |last=Larsen |first=Pamala D. |editor1-last=Lubkin |editor1-first=Ilene Morof |editor2-last=Larsen |editor2-first=Pamala D. |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |isbn=0763799661 |pages=3–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMCb5PeHXbcC |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the increased government expenditure in dealing with chronic care policy makers are searching for effective interventions and strategies.  These strategies can broadly be described within four categories.  These are [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]] and early detection, new providers, settings and qualifications, [[Disease management (health)|disease management programs]] and [[Clinical pathway|integrated care models]].&lt;ref name="tackcdie"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tackling Chronic Disease in Europe: Strategies, Interventions and Challenges |last=Busse |first=Reinhard |author2=Miriam Blümel |author3=David Scheller-Kreinsen |author4=Annette Zentner  |year=2010 |publisher=WHO Regional Office Europe |isbn=9289041927 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfyyrC7Q_j4C |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
One of the major problems from a health care system which is poorly coordinated for sufferers of chronic conditions is the incidence of patients receiving conflicting advice from different providers.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt; Patients will often be given prescriptions for medication that adversely interact with
one another.  One recent study estimated that more than 20% of older patients in the USA took at least one medication which could negatively impact another condition.&lt;ref name="ptc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0089447#pone.0089447-Anderson1 |title=Potential Therapeutic Competition in Community-Living Older Adults in the U.S.: Use of Medications That May Adversely Affect a Coexisting Condition |date=February 25, 2014 |work=PLOS ONE |publisher=Public Library of Science |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as therapeutic competition.

Effective chronic care requires an information platform to track patients' status and ensure appropriate treatments are given.&lt;ref name="kpiiltc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Key Policy Issues in Long-term Care |last=Brodsky |first=Jenny |author2=Jack Habib |author3=Miriam Hirschfeld  |year=2003 |publisher=World Health Organisation |isbn=9241562250 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8DXL147v_MC |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a recognised gap between treatment guidelines and current practice for chronic care.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Caring For People With Chronic Conditions: A Health System Perspective: A Health System Perspective |last=Nolte |first=Ellen |author2=Martin McKee |year=2008 |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=0335233708 |pages=2, 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV3id1wQIcsC |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individualised treatment plans are critical in treating chronic conditions because patients will place varying important on health outcomes.  For example, some patients will fore-go complex, inconvenient medication regimes at the expense of quality of life.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"/&gt;

===Multiple conditions===
One of the greatest challenges in this field of health care is dealing with the co-existence of multiple disorders,&lt;ref name="mcc"/&gt; which is called multi-morbidity.  There are few incentives within current [[health system|health care systems]] to coordinate care across multiple providers and varying services.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/reports/2010/rwjf54583 |title=Chronic Care: Making the Case for Ongoing Care |date=2010 |author=Gerard Anderson |publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2001 survey by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] found that physicians feel they have inadequate training to deal with multiple chronic conditions.  An increase in the number of chronic conditions correlates with an increase in the number of inappropriate hospitalizations.&lt;ref name="mtcfoc"/&gt;  Self-management can be challenging because recommended activities for one condition may be made difficult because of another condition.&lt;ref name="cfpwc"/&gt;

A nurse has to be qualified to handle all the needs of a chronic client and has to be an advocate to put the case of the chronically ill across to the health administration, hospital board or their families.

A variety of specialists such as surgeons, dietitians, nutritionists, and occupational therapists have to be in attendance for the maximum benefit of the client. Someone suffering from chronic pain for a long time may need the help of a psychiatrist. Everyday activities that the physically fit see as normal may be a Herculean feat for the chronically ill and they need all the support that they can get. The nurse may be privy to some of these help that the chronically ill can benefit from. They need to be proactive and put these patients in contact with these help but also sensitive enough to give their client the freedom to decline any help if they think that they do not need it.

Chronic pain might also get the person to start questioning their faith and/or wanting to have a deeper spiritual experience because of their pain and suffering.

The patient also needs to take time to participate in some fun activities. They may need to check out of the facility/hospital or get out of the house occasionally preventing an association of hospitals with pain. This further helps the patients keep their sanity and keeps them psychologically sound.

They may need a nurse who is qualified in palliative care. Some may be dying and they need respect and dignity as they die in pain. They also need a nurse who is non-judgmental and one who is also compassionate and caring. The family has to be involved to help the client better manage the pain. One very important quality is co-ordinating the best care for the client and some amount of diplomacy and empathy.

In some cases, such as with [[diabetes]] or [[sleep apnea]], the treatment is long term and difficult for patients to understand and comply with. In these cases [[chronic care management]] is highly recommended to help the patient learn about the consequences of refusing treatment and how to best follow treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38110">'''Comprehensive sex education (CSE)''' is a [[sex education]] instruction method based on-curriculum that aims to give students the knowledge, attitudes, skills and values to make appropriate and healthy choices in their sexual lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] in the future, including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]]. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing teenage and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and [[sexual violence]], thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes [[sexual abstinence]] as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as [[age of consent]], [[safe sex]], [[Birth control|contraception]] such as: [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Rachel|date=January 1, 2017|title=Sex Education: Funding Facts, Not Fear|url=http://p8888-ucelinks.cdlib.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/sfx_local?genre=article&amp;atitle=Sex%20Education%3A%20Funding%20Facts%2C%20Not%20Fear%20%5Bnotes%5D&amp;title=Health%20Matrix:%20Journal%20of%20Law-Medicine&amp;issn=0748383X&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=&amp;date=20170101&amp;aulast=Rubenstein,%20Rachel&amp;spage=525&amp;pages=&amp;sid=EBSCO:HeinOnline:hein.journals.hmax27.19#|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.|volume=27|pages=525–553|via=MasterFILE Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over [[abstinence-only sex education]] is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including condoms, contraception, and refusal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclunc.org/docs/executive_summary_-_2003_statewide_school_district_survey.pdf|title=Sex Education in California Public Schools: Are Students Learning What They Need to Know?|last=Burlingame|first=Julianne|date=August 2003|website=www.aclu.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of CSE ==
Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence-only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|title=Comprehensive Sex Education: Research and Results|date=2010-12-08|website=advocatesforyouth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208154235/http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|archive-date=December 8, 2010|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|title=Comprehensive Sex Education and Academic Success|date=2015-02-26|website=www.futureofsexed.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226100613/http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in "Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as "dirty" and "used." They have also used phrases such as "stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused"  and "chewed-up gum" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], HIV and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2009. ''International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education: An Evidence-informed approach for schools, teachers and health educators''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001832/183281e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of school-based sexuality education programmes has demonstrated increased HIV knowledge, increased self-efficacy related to condom use and refusing sex, increased contraception and condom use, a reduced number of sexual partners and later initiation of first sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Fonner et al. 2014. ''School based sex education and HIV prevention in low and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis''. PLoS ONE 9(3): e89692. Doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pone.0089692&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials in Europe, the United States, Nigeria and Mexico also confirmed that CSE prevents unintended adolescent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Oringanje, C. et al. 2009. ''Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents''. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.&lt;ref&gt;Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010. A multi-level model of condom use among male and female upper primary school students in Nyanza, Kenya. Soc Sci Med, Aug 5, Vol. 71, No. 3, pp. 616–25. Epub 2010, May 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; CSE also reduces the frequency of sex and the number of partners which in turn also reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] and the [[African Union]] have recognized CSE’s impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015. ''Empower Young Women and Adolescent Girls: Fast tracking the end of the AIDS epidemic in Africa''. Geneva, UNAIDS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA. 2014a. ''Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A focus on human rights and gender''. New York, UNFPA. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/pub-pdf/UNFPA%20Operational%20Guidance%20for%20 CSE%20-Final%20WEB%20Version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 22 curriculum- based sexuality education programmes found that 80 per cent of programmes that addressed gender or power relations were associated with a significant decrease in pregnancy, childbearing or STIs. These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, N.A. 2015. The case for addressing gender and power in sexuality and HIV education: A comprehensive review of evaluation studies. ''International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health'', Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 31–42. https:// www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4103115.html&lt;/ref&gt; CSE empowers young people to reflect critically on their environment and behaviours, and promotes gender equality and equitable social norms, which are important contributing factors for improving health outcomes, including HIV infection rates. The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2011a. ''School-Based Sexuality Education Programmes. A cost and cost-effectiveness analysis in six countries''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/&lt;/nowiki&gt; leadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/CostingStudy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014. ''Interventions to enhance girls’ education and gender equality''. Education Rigorous Literature Review. London, Department for International Development. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://r4d.d&lt;/nowiki&gt; d.gov.uk/pdf/outputs/HumanDev_evidence/Girls_Education_Literature_ Review_2014_Unterhalter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a necessary skill for delaying the age that young people first engage in sexual intercourse, and for using contraception, including condoms. CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self-esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism of CSE ==

=== How comprehensive is CSE ===
While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of "abstinence-plus," due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Ed for Caring Schools Creating an Ethics-Based Curriculum|last=Lamb|first=Sharon|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, "has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== LGBTQIA+ community not included CSE ====
The term "comprehensive" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curvino|first=Melissa and Meghan Grizzle Fischer|date=April 21, 2015|title=Claiming Comprehensive Sex Education is a Right Does Not Make it So|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=e0097ff0-d647-4666-83a3-1229b73b3d13%40sessionmgr120|journal=The New Bioethics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=72–98|via=Taylor and Francis Online|pmid=24979877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as "normal." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erevelles|first=Nirmala|date=2011|title=Coming Out Crip in Inclusive Education|url=|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBTQIA+ students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risky Lessons|last=Fields|first=Jessica|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. 

A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, "high school girls who identified as LGBTQIA+ were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide."&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobel M.D|first=Chanelle et. al|date=August 2017|title=Description of Sexual Orientation and Sexual Behaviors among High School Girls in New York City|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S1083318817300980?via%3Dihub|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=460–465|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|pmid=28279826|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that "the LGBTQIA+ youth accesses health information online five times more than the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, and these rates are even higher for LGBTQIA+ youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. &lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manduley|first=Aida, et al|date=February 8, 2018|title=The role of social media in sex education: Dispatches from queer, trans, and racialized communities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353517717751|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=28|pages=152–170|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0959353517717751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=State Laws and Policies Regarding Sex and HIV Education|last=|first=|date=2018-05-01|website=|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness, in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBTQIA+ people in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a Canada, a federal report showed that LGBTQIA+ community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBTQIA+ population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBTQIA+ community  about topics such  sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‐based projects, and one‐on‐one meetings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lévesque|first=Michel|date=November 29, 2017|title=The Comprehensive Health Education Workers Project and Caring Professionals as Asset‐Builders|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1002/nha3.20200|journal=New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development|volume=29|issue=4|pages=51–55|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/nha3.20200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Who's role is it to deliver sexual education ===
Many people regard health education as a moral or religious issue, and therefore should be taught not in schools.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; "Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent’s responsibility.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, which many people believe is not age appropriate.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Many of those in favor of abstinence only education, usually fear any type of sexual education that encourages sexual behavior at a young age.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Is it necessary ===
Although CSE is seen as the polar opposite of abstinence only education, some critics believe that they are very similar. They both aim at preventing STIs and teen pregnancy. The only way in which they differ is through their primary goal. Abstinence only education aims at reducing premarital sex while comprehensive sex education acknowledges that premarital sex may happen and therefore seeks to reduce the unintended consequences of premarital sex through education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Studies in developing counties surrounding sex education have also shown that comprehensive sex education is not needed. General education, such as literacy skills, was seen to delay sexual initiation and reduced the likelihood of pregnancy. Therefore, some people believe general education is of more importance.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== Federal funding for sexual education ==
Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Patrick and Monica Rodriguez|date=Spring 2011|title=Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/23032415|journal=Human Rights|volume=38|pages=5-22|via=JSTOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) ===
Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements ====
Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the "A-H guidelines," which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; They are as follows:

A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;

C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;&lt;p&gt;D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;&lt;/p&gt;E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;&lt;p&gt;G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and&lt;/p&gt;H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except only when describing failure rates.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) ===
More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP),  which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are "medically accurate and age-appropriate."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if "they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; 

=== California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act ===
In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that "materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners." Additionally, education must now include "instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships," regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

*normalize sexuality as part of human development;
*ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and  instruction; and
*provide pupils with the knowledge and skills to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships.

== CSE as a human right ==
Some critics state that young people’s access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized [[human rights]], which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002431/243106e.pdf|title=Emerging evidence, lessons and practice in comprehensive sexuality education: A global review 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100139-0|location=|pages=14, 15, 25, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) Committee, and the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the [[Commission on Population and Development]] (CPD), which – in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 – called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== CSE in curricula ==

=== CSE teaching methods ===
As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school [[curriculum]]. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners’ critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education – such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement – are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== CSE terminology ===
Apart from the different teaching methods, termiology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word "abstinence" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that "abstinence" connotates is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

The term "comprehensive," is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sex Ed Debates|last=Kendall|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows:&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;should be science-based and medically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Sexual education exemption ===
Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state,  excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Sexual content in the media  ==
Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skull|first=Tracie Marie et. al|date=2014|title=A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health Education|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043483|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–14|via=ERIC|pmid=27081579|pmc=4828968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Teens (ages 13-15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Some studies have found that, "very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme." &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, "At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die." This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary ''[[The Education of Shelby Knox]]'' released in 2005 about [[Lubbock, Texas]], which has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation. The "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

In 2013, ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]]'' was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observed how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|date=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|last=Stein|first=Sadie|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title=About Scarleteen|website=www.scarleteen.com|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator and editor [[Heather Corinna]], historian [[Hanne Blank]], author [[Jessica Valenti]], and [[sex education|comprehensive sex education]] advocate [[Shelby Knox]].

Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has [[social media]].  Platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as [[Person of color|persons of color]]  and LGBTQIA+ persons in hopes to "strengthen sexual health equity for all."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher-led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like [[Sex, Etc.]] and teensource.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teensource.org/content/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=teensource.org|publisher=TeenSource|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive sex education for teenagers.

'''Decision aids''' are interventions or tools designed to facilitate [[shared decision making]] and [[patient participation]] in health care decisions.

Decision support interventions help people think about choices they face; they describe where and why choice exists; and they provide information about options, including, where reasonable, the option of taking no action.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"/&gt; These interventions aim to help people to deliberate, independently or in collaboration with others, about options by considering relevant attributes to help them forecast how they might feel about short, intermediate and long-term outcomes which have relevant consequences.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"/&gt; Decision aids can be of any type but are most commonly pamphlets, videos, or web-based tools.&lt;ref name="StaceyLégaré2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=Dawn|last2=Légaré|first2=France|last3=Col|first3=Nananda F|last4=Bennett|first4=Carol L|last5=Barry|first5=Michael J|last6=Eden|first6=Karen B|last7=Holmes-Rovner|first7=Margaret|last8=Llewellyn-Thomas|first8=Hilary|last9=Lyddiatt|first9=Anne|last10=Thomson|first10=Richard|last11=Trevena|first11=Lyndal|last12=Wu|first12=Julie HC|last13=Stacey|first13=Dawn|title=Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions|year=2014|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub4|pmid=24470076|volume=1|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|pages=CD001431|url=http://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/ws/files/738870/O_Connor_2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28402085|date=August 2017}} Decision aids support the process of constructing preferences and eventual decision making, appropriate to their individual situation.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2009|title=Investing in deliberation: defining and developing decision support interventions for people facing difficult health decisions|url=https://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/who-is-involved-in-the-effective-health-care-program1/about-the-eisenberg-center/eisenberg-center-conference-series-2009/|journal=|series=White Paper Series|location=Gaithersberg, Maryland, USA|publisher=John M Eisenberg Center for Clinical Decisions and Communication|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=|vauthors=Elwyn G, Frosch D, Volandes A, Edwards A, Montori V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
There are numerous ways in which decision aids can be used.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"/&gt; They can be brief enough to be used during a clinical encounter or they can have sufficient content to be used  before or after clinical encounters. Although decision aids have been available since the early 1980s, evidence suggests that they are not well integrated into routine practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gravel K, Légaré F, Graham ID |title=Barriers and facilitators to implementing shared decision-making in clinical practice: a systematic review of health professionals' perceptions |journal=Implement Sci |volume=1 |issue= |pages=16 |year=2006 |pmid=16899124 |pmc=1586024 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-1-16 |url=http://www.implementationscience.com/content/1//16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
Decision aids provide people with a greater understanding of their medical treatment options and empower people to participate in their own health decision making.&lt;ref name=Stacey2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|last2=Légaré|first2=France|last3=Lewis|first3=Krystina|last4=Barry|first4=Michael J.|last5=Bennett|first5=Carol L.|last6=Eden|first6=Karen B.|last7=Holmes-Rovner|first7=Margaret|last8=Llewellyn-Thomas|first8=Hilary|last9=Lyddiatt|first9=Anne|date=2017|title=Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD001431|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28402085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supplementing patient-education consultations with decision tools improves people's knowledge about the risks and benefits of a procedure or medication and may help them make decisions that are in line with their personal values.&lt;ref name="Stacey2017" /&gt;

No adverse effects have been identified.&lt;ref name="Stacey2017" /&gt;

It is not clear what type of decision aid for patients is cost-effective.&lt;ref name="Stacey2017" /&gt; It is also not clear what impact the use of clinical decision aid systems that assist people who face healthcare treatments or screening decisions may have on the overall healthcare system.&lt;ref name="Stacey2017" /&gt; It is not known if decision aids are helpful for people who are not strong readers.&lt;ref name="Stacey2017" /&gt;

==Producers==
There are also many active research groups in the field, including the [http://www.ohri.ca/DecisionAid/ University of Ottawa], [http://tdi.dartmouth.edu/centers/informed-choice Dartmouth College], [http://www.decisionlaboratory.com/ Cardiff University] and Hamburg; the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] uses the IPDAS standards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipdas.ohri.ca/index.html|title=International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration|website=ipdas.ohri.ca|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce its decision aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/tools-and-resources/patient-decision-aids/|title=Patient Decision Aids {{!}} AHRQ Effective Health Care Program|website=www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
There has been an increase in use of decision support and a global interest in developing these interventions among both for-profit and not-for-profit organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor AM, Wennberg JE, Legare F |title=Toward the 'tipping point': decision aids and informed patient choice |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=716–25 |year=2007 |pmid=17485749 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.3.716 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17485749|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore essential to have internationally accepted standards to assess the quality of their development, process, content, potential bias and method of testing and evaluation. The International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration has published a checklist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elwyn G, O'Connor A, Stacey D |title=Developing a quality criteria framework for patient decision aids: online international Delphi consensus process |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7565 |pages=417 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16908462 |pmc=1553508 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38926.629329.AE |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16908462|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, an assessment instrument (IPDAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elwyn G, O'Connor AM, Bennett C |title=Assessing the quality of decision support technologies using the International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument (IPDASi) |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4705 |year=2009 |pmid=19259269 |pmc=2649534 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004705 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004705|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; to evaluate the quality of decision support interventions. In its November 2013 issue, ''BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making'' published a supplement that described the 10-year evolution of the IPDAS Collaboration and 12 core dimensions for assessing the quality of patient decision aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-13-supplement-2|title=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making|website=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While specifying minimum standards for patient decision support interventions is a feasible development, it is unclear whether the minimum standards can be applied to interventions designed for use within clinical encounters and to those that target screening and diagnostic tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joseph-Williams|first=Natalie|last2=Newcombe|first2=Robert|last3=Politi|first3=Mary|last4=Durand|first4=Marie-Anne|last5=Sivell|first5=Stephanie|last6=Stacey|first6=Dawn|last7=O'Connor|first7=Annette|last8=Volk|first8=Robert J.|last9=Edwards|first9=Adrian|date=2014-08-01|title=Toward Minimum Standards for Certifying Patient Decision Aids: A Modified Delphi Consensus Process|journal=Medical Decision Making: An International Journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making|volume=34|issue=6|pages=699–710|doi=10.1177/0272989X13501721|issn=1552-681X|pmid=23963501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Distinguished Gentleman's Ride''' is a global motorcycle fund-raising event to raise awareness of [[prostate cancer]] and male suicide prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gentlemansride.com/about|title=About|last=|first=|date=|website=The 2016 Distinguished Gentleman's Ride|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open to all genders, the ride was founded in 2012 by Mark Hawwa in Sydney, Australia &amp;mdash; inspired by a photo of [[Mad Men]]’s Don Draper on a classic bike in a fine suit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gentlemansride.com/about/style-guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The ride provides an outline of dress and behaviour, suggesting riders wear dapper clothing, silk vests, tweed suits and behave in an affable manner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gentlemansride.com/about/style-guide|title=Style Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The 2016 Distinguished Gentleman's Ride|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested motorcycles for the themed ride include [[café racer]]s, bobbers, classics, modern classics, flat trackers, scramblers, old school choppers, brat styled, classic scooters, and classic sidecars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ride carries no entry fee, and riders are encouraged to raise sponsorship money for prostate cancer research and male suicide prevention on behalf of charity partner The Movember Foundation.

'''''EHS Today''''' is a [[occupational safety and health]] [[magazine]]. Published monthly by [[Penton Media]], it is the leading US magazine for environmental, health and safety management professionals in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ulworkplace.com/about-us/community-involvement|work=UL Workplace|title=Community Involvement|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Honeywell Aerospace Named in EHS Today's 2012 America's Safest Companies|work=[[Honeywell]]|url=http://www.honeywellnow.com/2012/09/12/honeywell-aerospace-named-in-ehs-todays-2012-americas-safest-companies/|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=EHS Today Award: Goettle, Inc.

==History==
''EHS Today'' was first published in 1938 as ''Occupational Hazards and Safety'' by Irving B. Hexter.&lt;ref name=seven/&gt; Hexter, a [[Cleveland]] native and noted [[philanthropist]], was a graduate of the [[University of Michigan]]. He began his business career as president of his brother's clothing business, the Morreau Hexter Co. He subsequently established his own [[greeting card]] company and in 1930 founded the Industrial Publishing Co. (IPC). The first magazine he published was a monthly periodical titled ''Here's How Its Welded'' (now called ''Welding Design &amp; Fabrication''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Irving B. Hexter|work=[[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]]|url=http://www.cmnh.org/site/AtTheMuseum/PlanetariumandObservatory/Hexter.aspx|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hexter, Irving Bernard|work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|url=http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=HIB|date=July 17, 1997|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1960 IPC was the 5th largest trade paper publisher in the United States, producing 13 publications with an aggregate monthly circulation of 510,000, and an annual gross advertising volume of US$5 million.&lt;ref name="penton"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Penton Media|work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|url=http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=PM3|date=November 15, 2004|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launching the first issue, Hexter wrote: "Each stride of modern industry towards faster, better manufacture of old products, or towards development of new ones, has created additional health and accident hazards" and the magazine set out to raise awareness of the safety and health hazards - and the resulting loss of productivity - resulting from the implementation of the latest industrial processes.&lt;ref name=seven/&gt; The name of the magazine was subsequently truncated to ''Occupational Hazards''.

Following Hexter's death, IPC merged with Penton Publishing Co. to form Penton/IPC. In April 1998, the company changed its name to Penton Media.&lt;ref name=penton/&gt; Penton continued publication of ''Occupational Hazards'' until 2008, when the title was rebranded as ''EHS Today''.&lt;ref name="rebranding"&gt;{{Cite news|date=September 23, 2008|title=Penton Media Announces Rebranding of Occupational Hazards as EHS Today|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Penton+Media+Announces+Rebranding+of+Occupational+Hazards+as+EHS...-a0185437120|accessdate=|work=[[Business Wire]]|id=(From [[TheFreeDictionary.com#TheFreeLibrary.com|TheFreeLibrary]]).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandy Smith, editor-in-chief, explained: "''EHS Today'' was created for the EHS manager of the 21st century - one who can't be satisfied with an [[information silo]] but needs a comprehensive source of news and knowledge that is easily accessible in print or online. ''EHS Today'' builds on ''Occupational Hazards''' 70-year tradition of editorial excellence, but redefines the mission to serve today's multi-tasking, technologically savvy reader operating in a global economy. It's a 'clean sheet' magazine built on more than seven decades of intimate experience with the EHS profession."&lt;ref name=rebranding/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7395">The '''Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program''' (EEOICP) was passed in 2000 and is designed to compensate individuals who worked in [[nuclear weapons]] production and as a result of occupational exposures contracted certain illnesses.  The law was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on December 7, 2000.

==Executive Order 13179==
Executive Order 13179 states the following:

{{quote|Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women have served their Nation in building its nuclear defense. In the course of their work, they overcame previously unimagined scientific and technical challenges. Thousands of these courageous Americans, however, paid a high price for their service, developing disabling or fatal illnesses as a result of exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards unique to nuclear weapons production and testing. Too often, these workers were neither adequately protected from, nor informed of, the occupational hazards to which they were exposed.

Existing workers' compensation programs have failed to provide for the needs of these workers and their families. Federal workers' compensation programs have generally not included these workers. Further, because of long latency periods, the uniqueness of the hazards to which they were exposed, and inadequate exposure data, many of these individuals have been unable to obtain State workers' compensation benefits. This problem has been exacerbated by the past policy of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessors of encouraging and assisting DOE contractors in opposing the claims of workers who sought those benefits. This policy has recently been reversed.

While the Nation can never fully repay these workers or their families, they deserve recognition and compensation for their sacrifices. Since the Administration's historic announcement in July 1999 that it intended to compensate DOE nuclear weapons workers who suffered occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to the unique hazards in building the Nation's nuclear defense, it has been the policy of this Administration to support fair and timely compensation for these workers and their survivors.  The Federal Government should provide necessary information and otherwise help employees of the DOE or its contractors determine if their illnesses are associated with conditions of their nuclear weapons-related work; it should provide workers and their survivors with all pertinent and available information necessary for evaluating and processing claims; and it should ensure that this program minimizes the administrative burden on workers and their survivors, and respects their dignity and privacy. This order sets out agency responsibilities to accomplish these goals, building on the Administration's articulated principles and the framework set forth in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Energy shall be responsible for developing and implementing actions under the Act to compensate these workers and their families in a manner that is compassionate, fair, and timely. Other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall assist in this effort.}}

==Program administration==
The program is administered by the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (DOL).  EEOICP, as amended, has five sections:  Part B covers individuals, or certain survivors of individuals, who worked at a covered facility and have developed [[beryllium]] disease, [[silicosis]], or a [[cancer]]-related illness as a result of [[radiation]] exposure.  Part E is for individuals, or certain survivors of individuals, who developed any illness that resulted from exposure to [[toxins]].  Compensation under Part B is a lump sum payment of $150,000, except for eligible individuals who already received payment under the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA). RECA individuals will only receive a lump sum payment of $50,000.  In addition to the lump sum payment, compensation includes medical benefits from the date an individual files a claim.  Compensation under Part E is variable up to $250,000 based on wage loss, impairment, and survivorship.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Labor [http://www.dol.gov/owcp/energy/regs/compliance/progbenefits.htm EEOICP]&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilities that are covered under the Act are determined by DOL and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE).&lt;ref&gt;Department of Energy [https://energy.gov/ehss/services/worker-health-and-safety/energy-employees-occupational-illness-compensation-program EEOICP]&lt;/ref&gt;

DOL sends claims filed under Part B of the Act for cancers that may have been caused by occupational radiation exposure to the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) &lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ NIOSH]&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[radiation dose reconstruction]]. NIOSH requests the energy employee's individual exposure records from DOE and interviews the claimant or survivors to obtain information to use in the dose reconstruction. NIOSH also collects all relevant data regarding the individual's work site, if available, to complete the dose reconstruction.  Once the dose reconstruction is complete, NIOSH sends the dose reconstruction back to DOL and DOL makes compensation decisions.  The office responsible for completing dose reconstructions for NIOSH is the Office of Compensation Analysis and Support (OCAS).&lt;ref&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/default.html OCAS]&lt;/ref&gt;

All other Part B claims and all Part E claims remain at DOL for review and compensation determinations.

== Implementation ==
In July 2001, nine Energy Employee Compensation Centers were opened as a joint initiative of Departments of Labor and Energy. They were staffed and resourced to assist workers and their families with the lodgement of claims. The Department of Energy was to provide exposure data and work documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4655580/energy_employees_can_get_help_filing/|title=Energy employees can get help filing for compensation at new center (2001) - on Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status of claims ==
As of 13 March 2016, EEOICP has provided $12,300,456,504 in compensation and medical bill payments to sick workers and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/owcp/energy/regs/compliance/weeklystats.htm |title=U.S. Department of Labor - Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) |date=2016-03-18 |access-date=2016-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318052605/http://www.dol.gov/owcp/energy/regs/compliance/weeklystats.htm |archivedate=March 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions''', (also known as ''European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions'') abbreviated '''EU-SILC''', is a survey department of the [[EU]].
It replaced in 2004 the ''European Community Household Panel'' (ECHP), which covered the years 1994-2003. The EU-SILC includes only minor changes relative to its predecessor the ECHP; most importantly, it significantly expands the number of countries included in the sample.

'''Galactose''' ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|l|æ|k|t|oʊ|s}}, ''[[wikt:galacto-|galacto-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ose#Suffix 2|-ose]]'', "milk sugar"), sometimes abbreviated '''Gal''', is a [[monosaccharide]] [[Carbohydrate|sugar]] that is about as [[sweetness|sweet]] as [[glucose]], and about 30% as sweet as [[sucrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=db5QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264|title=Optimising Sweet Taste in Foods|last=Spillane|first=W. J.|date=2006-07-17|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=|isbn=9781845691646|location=|pages=264|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a C-4 [[epimer]] of [[glucose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QOoPlLgN5UMC&amp;pg=PA43|title=Organic Reactions Stereochemistry And Mechanism (Through Solved Problems)|last=Kalsi|first=P. S.|date=2007|publisher=New Age International|year=|isbn=9788122417661|location=|pages=43|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galactan]] is a [[polymer]]ic form of galactose found in [[hemicellulose]], and forming the core of the galactans, a class of natural polymeric carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=GDuy5zL6eRAC&amp;pg=PA78|title=The Antibodies|last=Zanetti|first=Maurizio|last2=Capra|first2=Donald J.|date=2003-09-02|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9780203216514|location=|pages=78|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''galactose'' was coined by Charles Weissman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Weismann in the 1940 Census {{!}} Ancestry|url=https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/New-York/Charles-Weismann_86gdp|website=www.ancestry.com|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 19th century and is derived from Greek ''galaktos'' (milk) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars ''[[-ose]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhat|first1=Paike Jayadeva|title=Galactose Regulon of Yeast: From Genetics to Systems Biology|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ofEx-CsVlIAC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=galactose+is+coined+by&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MB7yRs_sqW&amp;sig=N0_Bp8dmRdCDQBMTS3wVS9sOayw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI-4ru7KfYAhWMPI8KHR9pCzMQ6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=galactose%20is%20coined%20by&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|accessdate=26 December 2017|language=en|date=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology is comparable to that of the word ''[[lactose]]'' in that both contain roots meaning "milk sugar". Lactose is a disaccharide of galactose plus glucose.

==Structure and isomerism==
Galactose exists in both open-chain and cyclic form. The open-chain form has a [[carbonyl]] at the end of the chain.

Four isomers are cyclic, two of them with a [[pyranose]] (six-membered) ring, two with a [[furanose]] (five-membered) ring. Galactofuranose occurs in bacteria, fungi and protozoa,&lt;ref&gt;Nassau et al. [http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/178/4/1047.pdf Galactofuranose Biosynthesis in Escherichia coli K-12:...] Journal of Bacteriology, Feb. 1996, p. 1047–1052&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognized by a putative chordate immune lectin [[intelectin]] through its exocyclic 1,2-diol. In the cyclic form there are two [[anomer]]s, named alpha and beta, since the transition from the open-chain form to the cyclic form involves the creation of a new [[stereocenter]] at the site of the open-chain [[carbonyl]]. In the beta form, the alcohol group is in the equatorial position, whereas in the alpha form, the alcohol group is in the axial position.&lt;ref name="Ophardt, C. Galactose"&gt;[http://elmhcx9.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/543galactose.html Ophardt, C. Galactose]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:D-Galactose Haworth.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Cyclic forms of galactose]]
{{clear}}

==Relationship to lactose==
Galactose is a [[monosaccharide]]. When combined with [[glucose]] (monosaccharide), through a [[condensation reaction]], the result is the [[disaccharide]] [[lactose]]. The [[hydrolysis]] of lactose to glucose and galactose is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by the [[enzyme]]s [[lactase]] and [[beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]]. The latter is produced by the [[Lac operon|''lac'' operon]] in ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.

In nature, lactose is found primarily in milk and milk products. Consequently, various food products made with dairy-derived ingredients can contain lactose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance/ |title=Lactose Intolerance – National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse |last=Staff &lt;!-- Verified: No author provided on page. --&gt; |work=digestive.niddk.nih.gov |date=June 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galactose [[metabolism]], which converts galactose into glucose, is carried out by the three principal enzymes in a mechanism known as the [[Leloir pathway]]. The enzymes are listed in the order of the metabolic pathway: galactokinase (GALK), galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), and UDP-galactose-4’-epimerase (GALE).

In human [[lactation]], glucose is changed into galactose via hexoneogenesis to enable the [[mammary glands]] to secrete lactose. However, most lactose in [[breast milk]] is synthesized from galactose taken up from the blood, and only 35±6% is made from galactose from ''de novo'' synthesis.

Glucose is the primary metabolic fuel for humans. It is more stable than galactose and is less susceptible to the formation of nonspecific glycoconjugates, molecules with at least one sugar attached to a protein or lipid. Many speculate that it is for this reason that a pathway for rapid conversion from galactose to glucose has been [[Conservation (genetics)|highly conserved]] among many species.&lt;ref name=OMMBID72&gt;{{cite book |url=https://ommbid.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=971&amp;sectionid=62672411 |url-access=subscription |title=The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease  |chapter=Galactosemia |vauthors=Fridovich-Keil JL, Walter JH |veditors=Valle D, Beaudet AL, Vogelstein B, Kinzler KW, Antonarakis SE, Ballabio A, Gibson KM, Mitchell G |work=The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease}}&lt;br /&gt;a 4 b 21 c 22 d 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The main pathway of galactose metabolism is the [[Leloir pathway]]; humans and other species, however, have been noted to contain several alternate pathways, such as the [[De Ley Doudoroff pathway]]. The Leloir pathway consists of the latter stage of a two-part process that converts β-D-galactose to [[Uridine diphosphate glucose|UDP-glucose]]. The initial stage is the conversion of β-D-galactose to α-D-galactose by the enzyme, mutarotase (GALM). The Leloir pathway then carries out the conversion of α-D-galactose to UDP-glucose via three principal enzymes: Galactokinase (GALK) phosphorylates α-D-galactose to galactose-1-phosphate, or Gal-1-P; Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) transfers a UMP group from UDP-glucose to Gal-1-P to form UDP-galactose; and finally, UDP galactose-4’-epimerase (GALE) interconverts UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, thereby completing the pathway.&lt;ref name=Bosch07&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bosch AM |title=Classical galactosaemia revisited |journal=J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=516–25 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16838075 |doi=10.1007/s10545-006-0382-0 |url=}}&lt;br /&gt; a 517 b 516 c 519&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galactosemia]] is an inability to properly break down galactose due to a genetically inherited mutation in one of the enzymes in the Leloir pathway. As a result, the consumption of even small quantities is harmful to galactosemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1518|title=Classic Galactosemia and Clinical Variant Galactosemia|author=Gerard T Berry|work=nih.gov|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galactose is found in [[dairy product]]s, [[avocados]], [[sugar beet]]s, other [[natural gum|gum]]s and [[mucilage]]s. It is also [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] by the body, where it forms part of [[glycolipid]]s and [[glycoprotein]]s in several [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s; and is a by-product from the [[Algae fuel|third-generation ethanol]] production process (from macroalgae).

==Clinical significance==
Chronic systemic exposure of [[mice]], [[rat]]s, and ''[[Drosophila]]'' to D-galactose causes the acceleration of [[senescence]] (aging). It has been reported that high dose exposure of D-galactose (120 mg/Kg) can cause reduced sperm concentration and sperm motility in rodent and has been extensively used as an aging model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pourmemar E, Majdi A, Haramshahi M, Talebi M, Karimi P, Sadigh-Eteghad S, |title=Intranasal Cerebrolysin Attenuates Learning and Memory Impairments in D-galactose-Induced Senescence in Mice |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=87 |issue=Pt A |pages=16–22 |year=2017 |pmid=27894939|doi=10.1016/j.exger.2016.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = X.

Galactose is a component of the antigens present on blood cells that determine blood type within the [[ABO blood group system]]. In O and A antigens, there are two [[monomer]]s of galactose on the antigens, whereas in the B antigens there are three monomers of galactose.&lt;ref name="Raven and Johnson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Biology|edition=3rd|author1=Peter H. Raven |author2=George B. Johnson |pages=203|isbn=0-697-22213-6|year=1995|editor=Carol J. Mills|publisher=WM C. Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disaccharide composed of two units of galactose, [[galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose]] (alpha-gal), has been recognized as a potential [[allergen]] present in [[mammal meat]]. [[Alpha-gal allergy]] may be triggered by [[lone star tick]] bites.

== History ==

In 1855, E. O. Erdmann noted that hydrolysis of lactose produced a substance besides glucose.&lt;ref&gt;See:

From page 348: ''"Je propose de le nommer ''lactose''."'' (I propose to name it ''lactose''.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1860, [[Marcellin Berthelot|Berthelot]] renamed it "galactose" or "glucose lactique".&lt;ref&gt;Marcellin Berthelot, ''Chimie organique fondée sur la synthèse'' [Organic chemistry based on synthesis] (Paris, France:  Mallet-Bachelier, 1860), vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AtQYV5FlVwC&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 248–249].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Galactose" — from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:γάλακτος|γάλακτος]] (gálaktos, “milk”).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and Robert Morrell determined the [[molecular configuration|configuration]] of galactose.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Fischer and Robert S.

'''Health effects''' (or '''health impacts''') are changes in [[health]] resulting from exposure to a source. Health effects are an important consideration in many areas, such as [[hygiene]], [[pollution]] studies, [[occupational safety and health]], [[nutrition]] and [[health sciences]] in general.  Some of the major environmental sources of health effects are [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[noise pollution]] and [[over-illumination]]. 

A non-[[stochastic]] or deterministic health effect has a severity that is dependent on dose and is believed to have a threshold level for which no effect is seen. Stochastic health effects occur by chance, generally occurring without a threshold level of dose, whose [[probability]] is proportional to the dose and whose severity is independent of the dose, such as [[cancer]] and genetic effects. Occasionally, lack of exposure to certain effectors has detrimental consequences on an individual's health. Examples of such effectors include sunlight and exercise.

Since the early days of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]], his physical and mental [[health]] have been a subject of public debate. Trump was seventy years old when he took office, surpassing [[Ronald Reagan]] as the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|oldest person to assume the presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-oldest-president-us-history-2016-11|title=Donald Trump is oldest president elected in US history|publisher=Business Insider|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comments on his age, weight and lifestyle have raised questions about his physical health. In addition, numerous public figures, media sources, and mental health professionals have speculated that [[Donald Trump]] may have [[mental health]] challenges, ranging from [[narcissistic personality disorder]] to some form of [[dementia]]. Trump and his supporters have denied these allegations, and have contested the authority and motives of persons making such claims.

In February 2016, presidential candidate [[Jeb Bush]] speculated that Trump had mental health issues, stating "I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but the guy needs therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/02/jeb-bush-says-donald-trump-needs-therapy-new-hampshire/|title=Jeb Bush on Trump: I'm no shrink, "but he needs therapy"|publisher=''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''|date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/140702/medical-theory-donald-trumps-bizarre-behavior|title=A Medical Theory for Donald Trump’s Bizarre Behavior|publisher=''New Republic''|date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017, psychologist [[John Gartner (psychologist)|John Gartner]] collected more than 25,000 signatures of mental health professionals on a petition, directed to the national opposition leader, Democratic Senator [[Chuck Schumer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2017/02/19/psychologist-calls-on-colleagues-to-sign-petition-for-trumps-removal/#52fd90e264f3|title=The Trump Psych Debate: Is It Wrong To Say He's Mentally Ill?|first=Emily|last=Willingham|publisher=''Forbes''}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of April 2017 he was able to forward the petition with more than 41,000 signatures  of mental healthcare professionals to [[Washington D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/donald-trump-dangerous-mental-illness-yale-psychiatrist-conference-us-president-unfit-james-gartner-a7694316.html|title=35 psychiatrists just met at Yale to warn Donald Trump has a 'dangerous mental illness'|publisher=''The Independent''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the petition stated: ''My professional judgement is that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him  psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And I respectfully request him [sic] be removed from office, according to article 3 of the 25th Amendment, and so on''. Gartner asserted that Trump's mental handicaps are a mix of 1. [[narcissism]], 2. [[paranoia]]; 3. [[sociopathy]]; and 4. a dash of [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]].

On April 14, 2017, Representatives [[Jamie Raskin]] and [[Earl Blumenauer]] introduced the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|115|H.R.|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would replace the Cabinet as the body that, together with the Vice President, determines whether to invoke Section 4 of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permits removal of a President who is mentally incapacitated. Under the bill, an eleven-member commission, including four psychiatrists, would conduct an examination of the President when directed to do so by a [[concurrent resolution]] of the Congress.&lt;ref name=Marcos&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House Democrat introduces bill to amend presidential removal procedures|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/329206-house-democrat-introduces-bill-to-amend-presidential-removal-procedures|accessdate=July 1, 2017|publisher=The Hill|date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/opinion/trump-unfit-goldwater-rule.html|title=Who Decides Whether Trump Is Unfit to Govern?|first1=Peter D.|last1=Kramer|first2=Sally L.|last2=Satel|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blumenauer stated:

{{quote|It is hard to imagine a better group to work with the vice president to examine whether the president is able to discharge the duties of the office.

In January 2018, North Korea's leader [[Kim Jong-un]] and Trump publicly exchanged claims about their respective "nuclear buttons". In reaction, [[Richard W. Painter]], a former adviser to President [[George W. Bush]], deemed Trump "psychologically unfit" and supported transferring his powers to Vice President Pence under the 25th Amendment.&lt;ref name="NYT 1-6-18"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/us/politics/trump-genius-mental-health.html |title=Trump, Defending His Mental Fitness, Says He’s a ‘Very Stable Genius’ |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Maggie |last2=Haberman |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018 ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Trump's advisers "worry about his mental health" when he is outside the controls available in the White House environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/trumps-advisers-worry-about-his-mental-health-at-mar-a-lago |title=Trump’s Advisers Worry About His Mental Health at Mar-a-Lago |first=Isobel |last=Thompson |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Jeanne Suk Gerson wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'': "A strange consensus does appear to be forming around Trump's mental state," including Democrats and Republicans who doubt Trump's fitness for office.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt; Journalist [[Bill Moyers]] interviewed psychiatrist [[Robert Jay Lifton]] and said that Trump "makes increasingly bizarre statements that are contradicted by irrefutable evidence to the contrary". Lifton replied, "He doesn’t have clear contact with reality, though I’m not sure it qualifies as a ''bona fide'' delusion." As an example, Lifton said, when Trump claimed that [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|former president Barack Obama was born in Kenya]], "he was manipulating that lie as well as undoubtedly believing it in part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/09/19/the-dangerous-case-of-donald-trump-robert-jay-lifton-and-bill-moyers-on-a-duty-to-warn_partner/|title=The dangerous case of Donald Trump: Robert Jay Lifton and Bill Moyers on "A Duty to Warn"|first=Bill|last=Moyers|work=Salon|date=September 19, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump'' ====
{{main|The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump}}
In April 2017 forensic psychiatrist [[Bandy X. Lee]] hosted a meeting at Yale University medical school regarding the ethics of discussing Trump's mental health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2017-04-21/mental-health-professionals-debate-ethics-in-the-age-of-trump An Ethical Dilemma.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005717/https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2017-04-21/mental-health-professionals-debate-ethics-in-the-age-of-trump |date=2018-01-24 }} Susan Milligan, U.S. News, 21 April 2017.

Retrieved 23 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Lee published ''[[The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump]]'', containing essays from 27 psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health professionals on the "clear and present danger" that Trump's mental health poses to the "nation and individual well being". They argued that the president's issues affected the mental health of the United States population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Kathleen |title=Is Trump making America mentally ill? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-trump-making-america-mentally-ill/2017/06/13/28204b08-507b-11e7-be25-3a519335381c_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 13, 2017 |access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he placed the country at grave risk of war because of his pathological traits.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt; They defined Trump's behavior in terms of psychiatric diseases, such as [[narcissistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=IsTrump /&gt; Carlos Lozada, writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', considered these conclusions "compelling", but also noted that the book contributors were writing from their own political perspective, as other mental health professionals differ.&lt;ref name=IsTrump&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2017/09/22/is-trump-mentally-ill-or-is-america-psychiatrists-weigh-in/ |first=Carlos |last=Lozada |title=Is Trump Mentally Ill?

The letter titled [[I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration]] published by the New York Times declares most if not all those working for Trump see him as mentally unfit for his job.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Allegations of early stage dementia ===
It has been asserted that Trump has signs of some degree of an early stage of [[dementia]], constituting an inability to consistently remember facts, or respond appropriately to circumstances of his surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/joe-scaroborough-claims-sources-say-trump-has-early-signs-dementia-what-does-774057|title=Trump shows early signs of dementia, Joe Scarborough claimed sources say—what does that mean?|date=8 January 2018|publisher=''[[Newsweek]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On several occasions, Trump has been reported as appearing to have mental lapses. In March 2017, Trump forgot to sign two executive orders before leaving a signing ceremony for those orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/326796-trump-appears-to-forget-to-sign-executive-orders|title=Trump leaves photo op before signing executive orders|first=Brooke|last=Seipel|publisher=''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''|date=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, 2017, Trump, after deplaning from [[Air Force One]], appeared confused and wandered away from his waiting limousine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/donald-trump-gets-confused-looking-his-presidential-limousine-1629041|title=Watch a confused Donald Trump search for a limo that's right in front of his eyes|first=Jordan|last=Bhatt|date=5 July 2017|publisher=''International Business Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/trump-mocked-limo-video/|title=Trump gets a taste of his own medicine after he can’t find his limo|date=5 July 2017|publisher=''The Daily Dot''}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 12, 2017, Trump initially forgot to sign the Trumpcare executive order before leaving the signing ceremony, but was ushered back to the table by Vice President [[Mike Pence]] to complete this step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-forget-sign-executive-order-healthcare-obamacare-mike-pence-a7997661.html|title=Donald Trump almost forgets to sign executive order before reminder from Mike Pence|first=Alexandra|last=Wilts|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, during a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]] in [[Helsinki]], Trump made a statement interpreted by observers as indicating his inclination to accept Putin's denial of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], saying "President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44852812|title=Trump sides with Russia against FBI|date=16 July 2018|accessdate=17 July 2018|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following criticism of this remark, Trump made a statement asserting that this was the result of a mental lapse, stating "In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/397481-trump-says-he-accepts-us-intel-on-russia-then-adds-it-could-be-other|title=Trump says he accepts US intel on Russia — then adds it ‘could be other people also’|first=Ian|last=Swanson|date=17 July 2018|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Republican governor of New Jersey, [[Christine Todd Whitman]] wrote of this assertion that if Trump did make this error, "it demonstrates his inability to articulate accurately U.S. foreign policy at the highest level, for the highest stakes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-whitman-trump-helsinki-gop-response-20180722-story.html|title=Calling my fellow Republicans: Trump is clearly unfit to remain in office|first=Christine |last=Todd Whitman|website=latimes.com|date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses from Trump and supporters ===
Trump has dismissed questions regarding his mental health, stating that he is a "very stable genius".&lt;ref name="NYT 1-6-18"/&gt; As evidence of his mental capacities, he pointed to his business success, his victory over Republican competitors, and his election to the presidency against [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/06/politics/donald-trump-white-house-fitness-very-stable-genius/index.html |title=Trump: I'm a 'very stable genius' |first=Daniella |last=Diaz |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump and others have asserted that such questions are evidence of a problem with his critics, labeling them as suffering from a "[[Trump derangement syndrome]]" (TDS). For example, commenting on the book ''The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump'', [[RealClearPolitics]] writer Carl M. Cannon argued that the foreword by psychiatrist [[Robert Jay Lifton]] "offers the melodramatic view that clinicians who don't warn the world about Donald Trump's shortcomings are akin to Nazi doctors who worked at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. At the risk of practicing medicine without a license, I'd suggest that this historical comparison is ''de facto'' evidence of TDS – and paranoid grandiosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/09/17/trump_vs_psychiatrists_whos_crazier_135019.html |title=Trump vs. Psychiatrists: Who's Crazier? |work=[[RealClearPolitics]] |first=Carl M. |last=Cannon |date=September 19, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive test ===
In response to speculation about his cognitive abilities, Trump was administered the [[Montreal Cognitive Assessment]] (MoCA) at his own request as part of his January 2018 health checkup. He received a score of 30/30, indicating a normal level of cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-did-exceedingly-well-on-a-cognitive-test-top-white-house-doctor-says/2018/01/16/e8af8b8a-fadb-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html |title=Trump did exceedingly well on a cognitive test, top White House doctor says |last=Johnson |first=Jenna |date=January 16, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=June 8, 2018 |last2=Bernstein |first2=Lenny |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have contended that the MoCA test is too basic to diagnose the problems asserted.&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/health/trump-cognitive-screening-dementia.html|title=Trump Passed a Cognitive Exam.

A '''health system''', also sometimes referred to as '''health care system''' or as '''healthcare system''', is the [[organization]] of people, institutions, and resources that deliver [[health care]] services to meet the [[health]] needs of target populations.

There is a wide variety of health systems around the world, with as many histories and [[organizational structure]]s as there are nations. Implicitly, nations must design and develop health systems in accordance with their needs and resources, although common elements in virtually all health systems are [[primary healthcare]] and [[public health]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = White F | year = 2015 | title = Primary health care and public health: foundations of universal health systems | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/370197/| journal = Med Princ Pract | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 103–116 | doi = 10.1159/000370197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, health system planning is distributed among [[market (economics)|market]] participants. In others, there is a concerted effort among [[government]]s, [[trade unions]], [[charities]], religious organizations, or other co-ordinated bodies to deliver planned health care services targeted to the populations they serve. However, health care planning has been described as often evolutionary rather than revolutionary.&lt;ref name="liverpool-ha.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-ha.org.uk/health-care-system.html |title=''Health care system'' |publisher=Liverpool-ha.org.uk |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/01/26/090126fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all ''New Yorker'' magazine article: "Getting there from here."] 26 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system, is promoting a goal of [[universal health care]]: to ensure that all people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them. According to WHO, healthcare systems' goals are good health for the citizens, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair means of funding operations. Progress towards them depends on how systems carry out four vital functions: [[health care provider|provision of health care services]], resource generation, financing, and stewardship.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"&gt;World Health Organization. (2000). ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance.'' Geneva, WHO http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other dimensions for the evaluation of health systems include quality, efficiency, acceptability, and [[health equity|equity]].&lt;ref name="liverpool-ha.org.uk"/&gt; They have also been described in the United States as "the five C's": Cost, Coverage, Consistency, Complexity, and [[chronic disease|Chronic Illness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.jhu.edu/president/speeches/2007/health.html Remarks by Johns Hopkins University President William Brody: "Health Care '08: What's Promised/What's Possible?"] 7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[continuity of health care]] is a major goal.&lt;ref name=cook2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = R. I. | last2 = Render | first2 = M. | last3 = Woods | first3 = D. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.791 | title = Gaps in the continuity of care and progress on patient safety | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7237 | pages = 791–794 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10720370| pmc =1117777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Often '''health system''' has been defined with a reductionist perspective, for example reducing it to '''healthcare system'''. In many publications, for example, both expressions are used interchangeably. Some authors&lt;ref name="Frenk Global Health"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2797599 | pmid=20069038 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000089 | volume=7 | title=The global health system: strengthening national health systems as the next step for global progress | year=2010 | journal=PLoS Med. | pages=e1000089 | author = Frenk J}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed arguments to expand the concept of health systems, indicating additional dimensions that should be considered:
* Health systems should not be expressed in terms of their components only, but also of their interrelationships;
* Health systems should include not only the institutional or supply side of the health system, but also the population;
* Health systems must be seen in terms of their goals, which include not only health improvement, but also [[Health equity|equity]], responsiveness to legitimate expectations, respect of dignity, and fair financing, among others;
* Health systems must also be defined in terms of their functions, including the direct provision of services, whether they are medical or [[public health]] services, but also "other enabling functions, such as stewardship, financing, and resource generation, including what is probably the most complex of all challenges, the health workforce."&lt;ref name="Frenk Global Health"/&gt;

===World Health Organization definition===
The [[World Health Organization]] defines health systems as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities. A health system is therefore more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services. It includes, for example, a mother caring for a sick child at home; private providers; behaviour change programmes; vector-control campaigns; health insurance organizations; occupational health and safety legislation. It includes inter-sectoral action by health staff, for example, encouraging the ministry of education to promote female education, a well known determinant of better health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=WHO|year=2007|title=Everybody's business. Strengthening health systems to improve health outcomes : WHO's framework for action|url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/strategy/everybodys_business.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Providers==
{{Main article|Health care provider}}
Healthcare providers are institutions or individuals providing healthcare services. Individuals including health professionals and [[allied health professions]] can be self-employed or working as an employee in a [[hospital]], [[clinic]], or other health care institution, whether government operated, private for-profit, or private not-for-profit (e.g. non-governmental organization). They may also work outside of direct patient care such as in a government [[health department]] or other agency, [[medical laboratory]], or health training institution. Examples of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] are [[physician|doctors]], [[nursing|nurses]], [[midwifery|midwives]], [[dietetics|dietitians]], [[paramedic]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[medical laboratory technologist]]s, [[therapist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[Chiropractic|chiropractors]], [[Optometry|optometrists]], [[community health worker]]s, traditional medicine practitioners, and others.

Most countries' systems feature a mix of all five models. One study&lt;ref&gt;[[Sherry Glied|Glied, Sherry A.]] [http://papers.nber.org/papers/w13881 "Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity."] ''National Bureau of Economic Research'', March 2008. Accessed 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; based on data from the [[OECD]] concluded that all types of health care finance "are compatible with" an efficient health system. The study also found no relationship between financing and cost control.

The term health insurance is generally used to describe a form of [[insurance]] that pays for medical expenses. It is sometimes used more broadly to include insurance covering [[Disability insurance|disability]] or [[Long term care insurance|long-term nursing or custodial care]] needs. It may be provided through a [[social insurance]] program, or from private insurance companies. It may be obtained on a group basis (e.g., by a firm to cover its employees) or purchased by individual consumers. In each case premiums or taxes protect the insured from high or unexpected health care expenses.

By estimating the overall cost of health care expenses, a routine finance structure (such as a monthly premium or annual tax) can be developed, ensuring that money is available to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is typically administered by a government agency, a non-profit health fund or a corporation operating seeking to make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/insurance/upload/How-Private-Insurance-Works-A-Primer-Report.pdf How Private Insurance Works: A Primer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221100523/http://www.kff.org/insurance/upload/How-Private-Insurance-Works-A-Primer-Report.pdf |date=21 December 2008 }} by Gary Claxton, Institution for Health Care Research and Policy, Georgetown University, on behalf of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of commercial health insurance control their costs by restricting the benefits that are paid by through [[deductible]]s, [[co-payment]]s, [[coinsurance]], policy exclusions, and total coverage limits and will severely restrict or refuse coverage of pre-existing conditions. Many government schemes also have co-payment schemes but exclusions are rare because of political pressure. The larger insurance schemes may also negotiate fees with providers.

Many forms of social insurance schemes control their costs by using the bargaining power of their community they represent to control costs in the health care delivery system. For example, by negotiating drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies negotiating standard fees with the medical profession, or reducing [[unnecessary health care]] costs. Social schemes sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a scheme to deliver [[universal health care]], which may or may not also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers. Essentially the more wealthy pay proportionately more into the scheme to cover the needs of the relatively poor who therefore contribute proportionately less. There are usually caps on the contributions of the wealthy and minimum payments that must be made by the insured (often in the form of a minimum contribution, similar to a deductible in commercial insurance models).

In addition to these traditional health care financing methods, some lower income countries and development partners are also implementing non-traditional or [[innovative financing]] mechanisms for scaling up delivery and sustainability of health care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloom|first=G|title=Markets, Information Asymmetry And Health Care: Towards New Social Contracts|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2076–2087|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/markets-information-asymmetry-and-health-care-towards-new-so.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.034|pmid=18316147|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as micro-contributions, [[public-private partnership]]s, and market-based [[financial transaction tax]]es. For example, as of June 2011, [[UNITAID]] had collected more than one billion dollars from 29 member countries, including several from Africa, through an air ticket solidarity levy to expand access to care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in 94 countries.&lt;ref name="UNITAID"&gt;UNITAID.

Accessed 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payment models===
In most countries, [[wage]] costs for healthcare practitioners are estimated to represent between 65% and 80% of renewable health system expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Saltman RB, Von Otter C. ''Implementing Planned Markets in Health Care: Balancing Social and Economic Responsibility''. Buckingham: Open University Press 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kolehamainen-Aiken RL | year = 1997 | title = Decentralization and human resources: implications and impact | url = | journal = Human Resources for Health Development | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three ways to pay medical practitioners: fee for service, capitation, and salary. There has been growing interest in blending elements of these systems.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

====Fee-for-service====
''[[Fee-for-service]] arrangements'' pay [[general practitioner]]s (GPs) based on the service.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; They are even more
widely used for specialists working in [[ambulatory care]].&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

There are two ways to set fee levels:&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/53/22364122.pdf|title=Health-Care Systems: Lessons from the Reform Experience|publisher=OECD|author1=Elizabeth Docteur |author2=Howard Oxley |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By individual practitioners.
* Central negotiations (as in Japan, Germany, Canada and in France) or hybrid model (such as in Australia, France's sector 2, and New Zealand) where GPs can charge extra fees on top of standardized patient reimbursement rates.

====Capitation====
In ''[[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation payment systems]]'', GPs are paid for each patient on their "list", usually with adjustments for factors such as age and gender.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; According to OECD, "these systems are used in Italy (with some fees), in all four countries of the United Kingdom (with some fees and allowances for specific services), Austria (with fees for specific services), Denmark (one third of income with remainder fee for service), Ireland (since 1989), the Netherlands (fee-for-service for privately insured patients and public employees) and Sweden (from 1994). Capitation payments have become more frequent in "managed care" environments in the United States."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

According to OECD, "Capitation systems allow funders to control the overall level of primary health expenditures, and the allocation of funding among GPs is determined by patient registrations. However, under this approach, GPs may register too many patients and under-serve them, select the better risks and refer on patients who could have been treated by the GP directly. Freedom of consumer choice over doctors, coupled with the principle of "money following the patient" may moderate some of these risks. Aside from selection, these problems are likely to be less marked than under salary-type arrangements."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

====Salary arrangements====
In several OECD countries, general practitioners (GPs) are employed on ''[[salary|salaries]]'' for the government.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; According to OECD, "Salary arrangements allow funders to control primary care costs directly; however, they may lead to under-provision of services (to ease workloads), excessive referrals to secondary providers and lack of attention to the preferences of patients."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; There has been movement away from this system.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

==Information resources==
{{Main article|Health care delivery|Health information management|Health informatics|eHealth}}
Sound information plays an increasingly critical role in the delivery of modern health care and efficiency of health systems. Health informatics&amp;nbsp;– the intersection of [[information science]], [[medicine]] and [[healthcare]]&amp;nbsp;– deals with the resources, devices, and methods required to optimize the acquisition and use of information in health and biomedicine. Necessary tools for proper health information coding and management include [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]], formal [[Medical terminology|medical terminologies]], and computers and other [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]]. The kinds of [[health data]] processed may include [[medical records|patients' medical records]], [[hospital information system|hospital administration and clinical functions]], and [[HRHIS|human resources information]].

The use of health information lies at the root of [[evidence-based policy]] and [[evidence-based management]] in health care. Increasingly, information and communication technologies are being utilised to improve health systems in developing countries through: the standardisation of health information; computer-aided diagnosis and treatment monitoring; informing population groups on health and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=H|title=Information And Communications Technology For Future Health Systems In Developing Countries|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2122–2132|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/information-and-communications-technology-for-future-health.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.033|pmid=18343005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main article|Health policy|Public health|Health administration|Disease management (health)}}
The management of any health system is typically directed through a set of [[health policy|policies and plans]] adopted by government, private sector business and other groups in areas such as personal healthcare delivery and financing, [[pharmaceutical policy|pharmaceuticals]], [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]], and [[public health]].

Public health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a [[pandemic]]). Public health is typically divided into [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]]. [[Environmental Health|Environmental]], social, [[behavioral health|behavioral]], and [[occupational health]] are also important subfields.

[[File:Poliodrops.jpg|right|thumb|A child being immunized against [[polio]].]]
Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of ageing and [[health equity|health inequities]], although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a [[vaccination policy]], supporting public health programs in providing [[vaccination]]s to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries. Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.

The rapid emergence of many [[chronic disease]]s, which require costly [[chronic care management|long-term care and treatment]], is making many health managers and policy makers re-examine their healthcare delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_hiv_aids.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – HIV/Aides page |publisher=[[EUPHIX|Euphix]].org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major public health concern is [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_diabetes.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – Diabetes page |publisher=Euphix.org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of [[tobacco smoking]], linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_health_behaviours_smoking.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – Smoking Behaviors page |publisher=Euphix.org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antibiotic resistance]] is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. The [[World Health Organization]], for its [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]] campaign, is calling for intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other [[antimicrobial]] medicines for future generations.

Since 2000, more and more initiatives have been taken at the international and national levels in order to strengthen national health systems as the core components of the [[global health]] system. Having this scope in mind, it is essential to have a clear, and unrestricted, vision of national health systems that might generate further progresses in global health. The elaboration and the selection of [[performance indicator]]s are indeed both highly dependent on the [[conceptual framework]] adopted for the [[evaluation]] of the health systems performances.&lt;ref&gt;Handler A, Issel M, Turnock B.

In response to a series of papers published in 2012 by members of the World Health Organization's Task Force on Developing Health Systems Guidance, researchers from the Future Health Systems consortium argue that there is insufficient focus on the 'policy implementation gap'.

Health systems can vary substantially from country to country, and in the last few years, comparisons have been made on an international basis. The [[World Health Organization]], in its ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2000]]'', provided a [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|ranking of health systems]] around the world according to criteria of the overall level and distribution of [[health]] in the populations, and the responsiveness and fair financing of health care services.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"/&gt; The goals for health systems, according to the WHO's ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance'' (WHO, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2000) [http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/ ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance'']. Geneva, WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are good health, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair financial contribution. There have been several debates around the results of this WHO exercise,&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/health-systems-performance/docs/overallframework_docs.htm ''Health Systems Performance: Overall Framework.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617053343/http://www.who.int/health-systems-performance/docs/overallframework_docs.htm |date=17 June 2012 }} Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially based on the country [[ranking]] linked to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Navarro V | year = 2000 | title = Assessment of the World Health Report 2000 | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 356 | issue = | pages = 1598–601 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(00)03139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; insofar as it appeared to depend mostly on the choice of the retained [[performance indicator|indicators]].

'''Healthcare CRM''', also known as Healthcare Relationship Management &lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/article/can-software-solve-our-healthcare-crisis/&lt;/ref&gt;, is a broadly used term for a [[Customer relationship management]] system, or [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], used in healthcare.  There are two basic types of healthcare [[Customer relationship management|CRM]]s, one is for a healthcare organization to stay in contact with their patients, the other is for a healthcare organization to stay in contact with referring organizations.

The reason that there are two types of healthcare CRMs is because healthcare organizations generate new patients in two different ways.  The first way is from patient choice.  Individuals who are sick, hurt, need a dentist, or need a healthcare provider in some way find one that is suitable to their needs themselves.  Healthcare organizations want to attract new patients or maintain repeating patients so they use a healthcare CRM to manage the relationships with the public. This might be tasks like sending checkup appointment reminders, or birthday cards.&lt;ref name=Oracle&gt;{{cite web|last=Oracle|first=Products|title=Oracle data sheet|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/siebel/047088.pdf|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second way healthcare organizations generate patients is by referring organizations.  If an individual goes to a dentist and that individual needs their wisdom teeth removed, the dentist might refer that patient to an oral surgeon. Many hospitals and other specialty clinics rely heavily on referrals for patients.  Hospitals and specialty clinics use a healthcare CRM to maintain relationships with primary care physicians or other referring healthcare organizations.&lt;ref name="MarketWare Systems"&gt;{{cite web|last=MarketWare|first=Systems|title=Healthcare CRM|url=http://marketware.com/|publisher=MarketWare|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A healthcare-specific CRM differs from traditional CRM systems mainly in three ways&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clpmag.com/2017/07/building-relationships/&lt;/ref&gt;:
# Healthcare CRM systems are built to work within a healthcare organization’s unique structure. For example, a generic CRM system assumes that all people it stores will only be associated with one organization at any given time, yet physicians often work across multiple healthcare institutions. Generic CRM systems require significant customization to meet the needs of healthcare organizations&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hc1.com/platform/features/healthcare-crm/&lt;/ref&gt;.
# Healthcare CRM systems automatically unify and harmonize data from Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), billing, supply, courier, payer and other sources. Generic CRM systems expect significant manual entry of tasks and opportunities on the part of healthcare workers.
# Healthcare CRM systems are designed to be HIPPA compliant, with secure collaboration to support healthcare requirements.

There are a few companies that offer healthcare CRMs these are the industry leaders for the two types of healthcare CRMs.&lt;ref name=tuOtempO&gt;{{cite web|last=tuOtempO|first=Solutions|title=CRM for healthcare|url=http://www.tuotempo.com|publisher=tuOtempO|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infodemiology''' (and the closely related term [[infoveillance]]) is a term coined by [[Canada|Canadian]] researcher [[Gunther Eysenbach]]. Eysenbach defines "infodemiology" (or information epidemiology) as a "new research discipline and methodology [which deals with] the study of the determinants and distribution of health information [on the Internet]", with the ultimate goal to improve [[public health]]&lt;ref name=Eysenbach2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eysenbach | first1 = Gunther | date = Dec 2002 | title = Infodemiology: The epidemiology of (mis)information | url = | journal = American Journal of Medicine | volume = 113 | issue = 9| pages = 763–5 | doi=10.1016/s0002-9343(02)01473-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="e2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eysenbach|first1=G|title=Infodemiology: tracking flu-related searches on the web for syndromic surveillance.|journal=AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings. AMIA Symposium|date=2006|pages=244–8|pmid=17238340|pmc=1839505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eysenbach|first1=G|title=Infodemiology and infoveillance: framework for an emerging set of public health informatics methods to analyze search, communication and publication behavior on the Internet.|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|date=27 March 2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=e11|doi=10.2196/jmir.1157|pmid=19329408|url=https://www.jmir.org/2009/1/e11/|pmc=2762766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eysenbach first used the term in the context of measuring and predicting the quality of health information on the web (i.e., measuring the "supply" side of information).&lt;ref name=Eysenbach2002/&gt; 
He later included into his definition methods and techniques which are designed to automatically measure and track health information "demand" (e.g., by analyzing search queries) as well as "supply" (e.g., by analyzing postings on webpages, in blogs, and news articles, for example through [[Global Public Health Intelligence Network|GPHIN]]) on the Internet with the overarching goal to inform public health policy and practice. In 2013, the Infovigil Project was launched in an effort bring the research community together to help realize this goal, and is funded by the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infodemiology.org|title=The Infovigil Project|last=Eysenbach|first=Gunther|website=www.infodemiology.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eysenbach demonstrated his point by showing a correlation between flu-related searches on [[Google]] (demand data) and flu-[[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] data.&lt;ref name=e2006/&gt; The method is shown to be better and more timely (i.e., can predict public health events earlier) than traditional [[syndromic surveillance]] methods such as reports by sentinel physicians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6934">The '''Israeli paradox'''  is a [[catchphrase]], first used in 1996, to summarize the apparently paradoxical [[epidemiological]] observation that [[Israeli Jews]] have a relatively high [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD), despite having a diet relatively low in [[saturated fat]]s, in apparent contradiction to the [[Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease controversy|widely held belief that the high consumption of such fats is a risk factor for CHD]].  The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the Israelis ought to have a lower rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is higher.

The observation of Israel's paradoxically high rate of CHD is one of a number of paradoxical outcomes for which a literature now exists, regarding the thesis that a high consumption of saturated fats ought to lead to an increase in CHD incidence, and that a lower consumption ought to lead to the reverse outcome. The most famous of these paradoxes is known as the "[[French paradox]]": France enjoys a relatively low incidence of CHD despite a high per-capita consumption of saturated fat.

The Israeli paradox implies two important possibilities. The first is that the hypothesis linking saturated fats to CHD is not completely valid (or, at the extreme, is entirely invalid). The second possibility is that the link between saturated fats and CHD is valid, but that some additional factor in the typical Israeli diet, lifestyle or genes creates another CHD risk—presumably with the implication that if this factor can be identified, it can be isolated in the diet and / or lifestyle of other countries, thereby allowing both the Israelis, and others, to avoid that particular risk.

==Quantifying the Israeli paradox==
Israeli Jews eat a diet which is richer in linoleic acid (the most readily available plant-based form of omega-6 fatty acid, found in many vegetable oils) than any other population on the planet. Average per capita consumption is approximately 30 grams a day (11 kilograms annually),&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 25 grams daily for the average American in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Allport summarizes the Israeli paradox in the following words: 
{{cquote|Israelis eat less animal fat and cholesterol and fewer calories than Americans, but they have comparable rates of heart disease, obesity, diabetes and many cancers. They have an ideal diet, as far as the American food pyramid is concerned, but far from ideal health.”&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, pp. 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Allport notes that “Little butter is consumed in Israel, but large quantities of soybean, corn and safflower oil are….This translates, researchers estimate, to a linoleic acid intake of about 11 percent of calories and a ratio of linoleic to alpha linolenic acid [the most readily-available plant-based omega-3 fatty acid] in the Israeli diet of about 26:1.”&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; She observes that mean serum cholesterol in Israel is quite low by the standards of developed countries: 210 milligrams/dl. Therefore, one distinction that can, without controversy, be attributed to the high levels of linoleic acid in the Israeli diet is the high percentage of linoleic acid in the adipose tissue of Israelis: 24% as compared to 16% in Americans and less than 10% in many northern Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Allport, ''The Queen Of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet And What We Can Do To Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a 23-year follow-up study to the Israeli Ischemic Heart Disease Study of ten thousand public service employees (widely referred to as the “Israeli Civil Service Study”&lt;ref&gt;Nina Teicholz, ''The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 2014, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;) found that there were only “weak associations of long-term coronary mortality with the dietary intake patterns of fatty acids.”&lt;ref&gt;U. Goldbourt et al., “Factors Predictive of Long-Term Coronary Heart Disease Mortality Among 10,059 Male Israeli Civil Servants and Municipal Employees: A 23-Year Mortality Follow-up to the Israeli Ischemic Heart Disease Study.” ''Cardiology'' 82 (1993), 100-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying and naming the Israeli paradox==
The term "Israeli Paradox" was first used by researchers Daniel Yam, Abraham Eliraz and Elliot Berry in a 1996 article in the ''Israel Journal of Medical Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Yam, Abraham Eliraz and Elliot Berry, “Diet and Disease—The Israeli Paradox: Possible Dangers of a High Omega-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Diet” in ''Israel Journal of Medical Sciences'' 32 (1996): 1134-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors observed that Israelis consumed polyunsaturated fatty acids (primarily omega-6s rather than omega-3s)  at a rate about 8% higher than in the United States and about 10-12% higher than most of Europe. They wrote, “Israeli Jews may be regarded as a population-based dietary experiment of the effect of a high omega-6 PUFA [polyunsaturated fatty acid] diet.”

The most readily-observable result of the relatively high ratio of omega-6 fats to saturated fats in the Israeli diet was the deposition of omega-6 fats in preference to saturated fats in the adipose tissue of Israelis. This had been observed as early as 1976, when an article in the ''Israel Journal of Medical Sciences'' noted that, counting polyunsaturated fats (which includes both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids) as a whole, the ratio of polyunsaturated fats to saturated fats in the adipose tissue of Ashkenazi Jews in Israel was 0.88:1, while for non-Ashkenazi Jews it was 1.13:1. This was, according to the authors, “the highest reported for any population on a free-choice diet.”&lt;ref&gt;SH Blondheim et al., “Unsaturated Fatty Acids in the Adipose Tissue of Israeli Jews” in ''Israel Journal of Medical Sciences'' 12 (1976): 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20499">{{short description| Procedure to integrate safety practices into a particular task }}
{{more footnotes|date=February 2010}}

A '''job safety analysis''' (JSA) is a procedure which helps integrate accepted safety and health principles and practices into a particular task or job operation. In a JSA, each basic step of the job is to identify potential hazards and to recommend the safest way to do the job. Other terms used to describe this procedure are job hazard analysis (JHA) and job hazard breakdown.

The terms "job" and "task" are commonly used interchangeably to mean a specific work assignment, such as "operating a grinder," "using a pressurized water extinguisher" or "changing a flat tire." JSAs are not suitable for jobs defined too broadly, for example, "overhauling an engine"; or too narrowly, for example, "positioning car jack."

==Terminology and definitions==

;Workplace hazard categories:
:Workplace hazards can be allocated to three categories:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:: [[#Workplace Hazard Types|Types]],
:: [[#Workplace Hazard Groups|Groups]], and
:: [[#Hazard Families|Families.]]

;Workplace hazard types:
:There are two hazard types. They are:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:: Hazards to safety - anything assessed as "possible", or more likely, to cause an immediate injury
:: Hazards to health - anything assessed as "possible", or more likely, to cause harm by repeated exposure over time.

;Workplace hazard groups:
:There are three hazard groups. They are:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:: Physical object hazard – touch or inhale it.
:: Hazardous work type – requires a permit, qualification etc.
:: Duty of care breaches - Legislative and/or company contraventions.

;Hazard families:
:There are many hazard families. The following list is not exhaustive. Many hazards will fit into more than one family.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:Physical, chemical, electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, biological, magnetic, thermal, gravitational, environmental, ergonomic, psychological, invisible, visible, and developing.{{clarify|reason=what is meant by developing|date=June 2017}}

;Workplace hazard criteria:
: These criteria are a set of tests to help identify genuine workplace hazards related to a task.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
:: '''"Clearly identifiable"''' means that the hazard type, group and family are clearly linked to a hazard.
:: '''"A scenario is not required for its articulation"''' - It can be clearly described in few (generally five, or less, words). If this is not possible, it is probably not a hazard.
:: It has an inherent likelihood of '''"possible"''' or greater - If the hazard under consideration is not inherently at least "possible", then it does not present a risk.
:: The description is '''without "judgmental adjectives"''' - Judgmental adjectives are negative and sometimes overlap with "descriptions of absence". Adjectives such as poor, deficient, defective, scant, weak, unsound, or faulty, are not used in the hazard column.
:: The description '''contains no "descriptions of absence"''' - Descriptions of absence are usually negative and sometimes overlap with judgmental adjectives. They include: Without, lack of, minimal, unsuitable, unavailable, inadequate, missing, non-existent.

;Mechanism of Injury (MoI):
:Mechanism of injury (MoI) is how an injury occurs. It is important because in the absence of an MoI there is no hazard.
:Common MoIs are "slips, trips and falls", for example:
:: Hazard = Tool bag (in walkway)
:: MoI =  Trip (over tool bag)
:: Injury =  Bone fracture 
: Other common mechanisms of injury include:
:* Struck against or by
:* Contact with or by
:* Caught in, on, by or between
:* Exposure to
:* Fall to same or lower level

;Likelihood:
:Likelihood is how often an event is reasonably and realistically expected to occur in a given time, and may be expressed as a [[probability]], [[frequency]] or percentage.

;Consequence:
:Consequence is the outcome of an event expressed qualitatively or quantitatively, being a loss, injury, disadvantage or gain. There may be a range of possible outcomes associated with an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=AS/NZS4360:2009 Risk Management/year=2009|publisher=Australian Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Consequence is the severity of the injury or harm that can be reasonably and realistically expected from exposure to the mechanism of injury of the hazard being rated.
:An implemented control may affect the severity of the injury, but it has no effect on the way the injury occurred. Therefore, when rating risk, the consequence remains the same for both the initial rating and the residual rating.
:People inherently tend to overestimate severity of consequence when rating risk,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} but the rating should be both reasonable and realistic.

;Risk:
: [[Risk]] is the combination of likelihood and consequence.

;Risk Authority:
:The organisational level of the person authorised to accept a specified level of risk, for example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Risk Level !! Risk Authority
|-
| Low risk || Supervisor
|-
| Moderate risk || Superintendent
|-
| Significant risk || Manager
|-
| High risk || Unacceptable without mitigation
|}
 
;ALARP:
:[[ALARP]] is an acronym for "As Low As Reasonably Practicable".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Risk Management - Risk assessment techniques - International Standard IEC/ISO 31010|year=2011|publisher=ISO| pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:When applied to JSA, this means that it is not necessary to reduce risk beyond the point where the cost of further control becomes disproportionate to any achievable safety benefit.
:The acronym "ALARA",  which stands for "As Low As Reasonably Achievable", is also in common usage.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

;Reasonably Practicable:
: Reasonably practicable, in relation to a duty to ensure health and safety, means that which is, or was at a particular time, reasonably able to be done to ensure health and safety, taking into account and weighing up all relevant matters including:&lt;ref&gt;How to determine what is reasonably practicable to meet a health and safety duty - Guidance note - Safe Work Australia - May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
:* the likelihood of the hazard or the risk concerned occurring; 
:* the degree of harm that might result from the hazard or the risk; 
:* what the person concerned knows, or ought reasonably to know, about the hazard or risk, and about the ways of eliminating or minimising the risk; 
:* the availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise the risk; and
:* after assessing the extent of the risk and the available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, the cost associated with available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk, including whether the cost is grossly disproportionate to the expected reduction of risk.

;Work Process:
:The way in which work is performed is called the "Work Process".

;PEPE:
:Acronym for the four elements that are present in every task of the work process:
:* '''P'''rocess,
:* '''E'''nvironment,
:* '''P'''eople,
:* '''E'''MT, which is itself an acronym for 'equipment, materials and tools'.
:'''PEPE''' is used to assist in identifying hazards.

;Process
:In this context, process is about procedures, standards, legislation, safe work instructions, permits and permit systems, risk assessments and policies.
:Key factors for effective process are that the relevant components are in place, easy to follow and regularly reviewed and updated.

;Environment:
: People may be exposed to issues related to:
* Access &amp; Egress.
* Obstructions.
* Weather.
* Dust, heat, cold, noise.
* Darkness.
* Contaminants.
* Isolated workers.
* Other Workers.

;People:
:To assist people to be safe in their workplace they need to be provided with sufficient information, training, instructions and supervision.
:People may be:
:* Untrained.
:* Not yet competent.
:* Uncertified.
:* Inexperienced.
:* Unsupervised.
:* Affected by alcohol or other drugs.
:* Fatigued.
:* Inadequately instructed.
:* Suffering from stress from home life or [[workplace bullying]].
:* Have a poor attitude to, or refuse to follow procedures.

;Equipment, Material and Tools  (EMT):
:The right EMT must be selected for the task. Incorrect EMT selections may be hazardous in themselves.
:* The EMT may be hazardous, e.g.: sharp, hot, vibrating, heavy, fragile, contain pinch points, a hazardous substance containing hydrocarbons, acids, alkalis, glues, solvents, asbestos etc.
:* There may be a need for isolating personnel from energy sources such as electricity, hydraulic, pneumatic, radiation and gravitational sources.
:* Is the EMT in date? Does it require certification and/or calibration, tested and tagged?
:* Obstructions should be kept out of walkways and leads and hoses suspended?

==Hazard controls==

Controls are the barriers between people and/or assets and the hazards.

A hard control provides a physical barrier between the person and the hazard. Hard controls include machine guards, restraint equipment, fencing/barricading.

A soft control does not provide a physical barrier between the person and the hazard. Soft controls include signage, procedures, permits, verbal instructions etc.

===Control effectiveness criteria===

The effectiveness of a control is measured by its ability to reduce the likelihood of a hazard causing injury or damage. A control is either effective or not.

To gauge this effectiveness several control criteria are used, which:
*Address the relevant aspects of PEPE,
*Reduce likelihood to ALARP,
*Selected hard controls in preference to soft controls, and
*Contain a ‘doing word’.

There is no commonly used mathematical way in which multiple controls for a single hazard can be combined to give a score that meets an organisations acceptable risk level.  In instances where the residual risk is greater than the organisations acceptable risk level, consultation with the organisations relevant risk authority should occur.

===Hierarchy of control===

[[Hierarchy of hazard control|Hierarchy of control]] is a system used in industry to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

It is a widely accepted system promoted by numerous safety organizations. This concept is taught to managers in industry, to be promoted as 
a standard practice in the workplace.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Various illustrations are used to depict this system, most commonly a triangle.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The hierarchy of hazard controls are, in descending order of effectiveness:  Elimination,  Substitution,  Engineering,  Administration and Personal Protective Equipment. In some systems, Isolation is included in the list of controls. The list then is Elimination,  Substitution,  Isolation, Engineering,  Administration and Personal Protective Equipment.

== Scope of application ==
A JSA is a documented risk assessment developed when company policy directs employees to do so. Workplace hazard identification and an assessment of those hazards may be required before every job.

JSAs are usually developed when directed to do so by a supervisor, when indicated by the use of a first tier risk assessment and when a hazard associated with a task has a likelihood rating of 'possible' or greater.

Generally, high consequence, high likelihood task hazards are addressed by way of a JSA.

These may include, but are not limited to, those with:

A history of, or potential for, injury, harm or damage such as those involving:

# Fire, chemicals or a toxic or oxygen deficient atmosphere.
# Tasks carried out in new environments.
# Rarely performed tasks.
# Tasks that may impact on the integrity or output of a processing system.
It is important that employees understand that it is not the JSA form that will keep them safe on the job, but rather the process it represents. It is of little value to identify hazards and devise controls if the controls are not put in place. Workers should never be tempted to "sign on" the bottom of a JSA without first reading and understanding it.

JSAs are quasi-[[legal document]]s, and are often used in [[incident investigation]]s, [[contractual dispute]]s, and court cases.

== Structure of a JSA ==
The JSA or JHA is usually created by the [[work group]] who will perform the task. The more minds and experience applied to analysing the hazards in a job, the more successful the work group is likely to be in controlling them. Sometimes it is expedient to review a JSA that was prepared when the same task was performed on a previous occasion, but care should be taken to ensure that all of the hazards for the job are controlled for the new occasion. The JSA is usually recorded in a standardised tabular format with three to as many as five or six columns.{{clarify|reason=what are the other columns for?|date=June 2017}} The headings of the three basic columns are: Job step, Hazard and Controls. A Hazard is any factor that can cause damage to [[personnel]], [[property]] or the [[Natural environment|environment]] (some companies include loss of production or [[downtime]] in the definition as well). A Control is any process for controlling a hazard. The job is broken down into its component steps. Then, for each step, hazards are identified. Finally, for each hazard identified, controls are listed. In the example below, the hazards are analyzed for the task of erecting scaffolding and welding lifting lugs:

=== Assessing risk levels ===

Some organisations add columns for risk levels. The risk rating of the hazard prior to applying the control is known as the 'inherent risk rating'. The risk rating of the hazard with the control in place is known as the 'residual' risk rating.

Risk, within the occupational health and safety sphere, is defined as the 'effect of uncertainties on objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Risk management - Principles and guidelines|publisher=Standards Australia|isbn=0 7337 9289 8|pages=Preface (a)}}&lt;/ref&gt;'. In the context of rating a risk, it is the correlation of 'likelihood' and 'consequence', where likelihood is a quantitative evaluation of frequency of occurrences over time, and consequence is a qualitative evaluation of both the "Mechanism of Injury" and the reasonable and realistic  estimate of "Severity of Injury".

Example:

:There is historical precedent to reasonably and realistically evaluate that the likelihood of an adverse event occurring while operating a hot particle producing tool, ([[grinding machine|grinder]]), is "possible", therefore the activity of grinding meets the workplace hazard criteria.

:It would also be reasonable and realistic to assume that the mechanism of injury of an eye being struck at high speed with hot metal particles may result in a permanent disability, whether it be the eye of the grinder operator, a crew member or any person passing or working adjacent to, above or below the grinding operation.

:The severity of reasonably and realistically expected injury may be [[blindness]]. Therefore, grinding warrants a high severity rating.

:Wearing eye protection while in the vicinity of grinding operations reduces the likelihood of this adverse event occurring.

:If the eye protection was momentarily not used, not fitted correctly or failed and hot high speed particles struck an eye, the expected mechanism of injury (adverse event) has still occurred, hence the consequence rating remains the same for both the inherent and residual consequence rating.

:It is accepted that the control may affect the severity of injury, however, the rated consequence remains the same as the effect is not predictable.

One of the known risk rating anomalies is that likelihood and the severity of injury can be scaled, but mechanism of injury cannot be scaled. This is the reason why the mechanism of injury is bundled with severity, to allow a rating to be given.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The MoI is an important factor as it suggests the obvious controls.

=== Identifying responsibilities ===
Another column that is often added to a JSA form or [[worksheet]] is the ''Responsible'' column. The Responsible column is for the name of the individual who will put the particular control in place. Defining who is responsible for actually putting the controls in place that have been identified on the JSA worksheet ensures that an individual is accountable for doing so.

=== Application of the JSA ===
After the JSA worksheet is completed, the work group that is about to perform the task would have a [[toolbox talk]], to discuss the hazards and controls, delegate responsibilities, ensure that all equipment and personal protective equipment described in the JSA are available, that contingencies such as [[fire fighting]] are understood, communication channels and hand signals are agreed etc. Then, if everybody in the work group agrees that it is safe to proceed with the task, work can commence.

If at any time during the task circumstances change, then work should be stopped (sometimes called a "time-out for safety"), and the hazards and controls described in the JSA should be reassessed and additional controls used or alternative methods devised. Again, work should only continue when every member of the work group agrees it is safe to do so.

When the task is complete it is often of benefit to have a close-out or "tailgate" meeting, to discuss any lessons learned so that they may be incorporated into the JSA the next time the task is undertaken.

'''Kazutaka Kogi''' (born 1933) is a Japanese academic known for his contributions to simple, low-cost [[Organization development#OD interventions|interventions]] in small manufacturing enterprises that improve the [[working conditions]] for the employees and at the same time also improve the overall [[productivity]] of the workforce.  The interventions are based on simple and low-cost modifications, on local solutions to highly specific local problems and specifically on the collaboration between the shopfloor and the managerial level.  This collaborative or participatory approach is possible because the intervention is presented as a [[win-win game|win-win situation]] for both parties.  Kazutaka Kogi and his colleague [[Kageyo Noro]] are considered to have founded the concept of [[participatory ergonomics]] in Singapore in 1983&lt;ref&gt;Karwowski and Maras (1999) p1422&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked extensively for the [[International Labour Organization]] and held the Vice-Presidency for [[ICOH]] in 2006-2009.

'''Long-term care''' ('''LTC''') is a variety of services which help meet both the medical and non-medical needs of people with a [[chronic illness]] or [[disability]] who cannot care for themselves for long periods. Long term care is focused on individualized and coordinated services that promote independence, maximize patients' quality of life, and meet patients' needs over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of the U.S. Health Care System|last=Leiyu Shi and Douglas Singh|first=|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning; 4 edition|date=December 8, 2015|isbn=1284100553|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for long-term care to provide custodial and non-skilled care, such as assisting with [[activities of daily living|normal daily tasks]] like [[clothing|dressing]], feeding, using the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kernisan|first1=Leslie|title=Activities of Daily Living: What Are ADLs and IADLs?|url=https://www.caring.com/articles/activities-of-daily-living-what-are-adls-and-iadls|publisher=Caring|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, long-term care involves providing a level of medical care that requires the expertise of skilled practitioners to address the multiple chronic conditions associated with older populations. Long-term care can be provided at home, in the community, in [[assisted living]] facilities or in [[nursing home]]s. Long-term care may be needed by people of any age, although it is a more common need for [[senior citizens]].&lt;ref name="WHO Bulletin"&gt;[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/1/12-020112.pdf "Defusing the demographic "time-bomb" in Germany."] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2012;90:6–7 | {{doi|10.2471/BLT.12.020112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of long-term care==
Long-term care can be provided formally or informally. Facilities that offer formal LTC services typically provide living accommodation for people who require on-site delivery of around-the-clock supervised care, including professional health services, personal care, and services such as meals, laundry and housekeeping.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"&gt;Health Canada. [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/home-domicile/longdur/index-eng.php Long-Term Facilities-Based Care.] Accessed 3 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These facilities may go under various names, such as nursing home, personal care facility, residential continuing care facility, etc. and are operated by different providers.

While the US government has been asked by the LTC (long-term care) industry ''not'' to bundle health, personal care, and services (e.g., meal, laundry, housekeeping) into large facilities, the government continues to approve that as the primary use of taxpayers' funds instead (e.g., new assisted living). Greater success has been achieved in areas such as supported housing which may still utilize older housing complexes or buildings, or may have been part of new federal-state initiatives in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, J. &amp; Wiener, J. (2004). Public funding for long term care services for older people with residential care settings. In: J. Pynoos, P. Hollander-Feldman, &amp; J. Ahers, ''Linking Housing and Services for Older Adults: Obstacles, Options and Opportunities'', pp. 51-80. NY, NY: The Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term care provided formally in the home, also known as [[home care|home health care]], can incorporate a wide range of clinical services (e.g. [[nursing]], [[drug therapy]], [[physical therapy]]) and other activities such as physical construction (e.g. installing hydraulic lifts, renovating bathrooms and kitchens). These services are usually ordered by a [[physician]] or other professional. Depending on the country and nature of the health and social care system, some of the costs of these services may be covered by [[health insurance]] or [[long-term care insurance]].

Modernized forms of long term services and supports (LTSS), reimbursable by the government, are user-directed personal services, family-directed options, independent living services, benefits counseling, mental health companion services, family education, and even self-advocacy and employment, among others. In home services can be provided by personnel other than nurses and therapists, who do not install lifts, and belong to the long-term services and supports (LTSS) systems of the US.

Informal long-term home care is care and support provided by family members, friends and other unpaid volunteers. It is estimated that 90% of all home care is provided informally by a loved one without compensation&lt;ref name="Saltman"/&gt; and in 2015, families are seeking compensation from their government for caregiving.

==Long-term services and supports==
"Long-term services and supports" (LTSS) is the modernized term for community services, which may obtain health care financing (e.g., home and community-based Medicaid waiver services),&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (2011, May 5). HCBS waivers-Section 1915c. Washington, DC: Author. Retrieved in May 2011 from: http://www.cms.gov/MedicaidStWaivprogDemoPG1/05{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (2012). Thirty years of home and community-based services: Getting closer and cloer to home. ''Generations: Journal of the American Society for Aging'', 1-5. Retrieved in August 2012 from: http://www.asaging.org/Blog/thirty-years-home-and-community-based{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may or may not be operated by the traditional hospital-medical system (e.g., physicians, nurses, nurse's aides).&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D. (2011). Long term care spending for disability. ''Disability Spending in States: 1997-2008''. Boulder, CO: University of Colorado, Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) &lt;ref&gt;Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities. (2014). ''Long-Term Services and Supports Taskforce''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; which works with the U. S. Congress, has indicated that while hospitals offer acute care, many non-acute, long-term services are provided to assist individuals to live and participate in the community. An example is the group home international emblem of community living and deinstitutionalization,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. &amp; Traustadottir, R. (2005). ''Deinstitutionalization and People with Intellectual Disabilities''. London, UK: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and the variety of supportive services (e.g., [[supported housing]], [[supported employment]], [[supported living]], supported parenting, [[family support]]), supported education.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). ''Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities in the Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ullmer, D., Webster, S., &amp; McManus. (1991, August). ''Cultivating Competence: Models of Support for Families Headed by Parents with Cognitive Limitations: A National Resource Directory''. Madison, WI: Wisconsin (Governor's) Council on Developmental Disabilities, Supported Parenting Project.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unger, K. (1993, July). Special Issue on Supported Education, 17(1). ''Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal'', Boston, MA: International Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services and the Department of Rehabilitation Counseling, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also common with aging groups, such as the American Association of Retired Persons ([[AARP]]), which annually surveys the US states on services for elders (e.g., intermediate care facilities, assisted living, home-delivered meals). Long term services and supports are discussed in depth in the forthcoming, ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US'' (Racino, manuscript 2012, in press, 2014) &lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014) ""Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US."" NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; The new US Support Workforce includes the Direct Support Professional, which is largely non-profit or for-profit, and the governmental workforces, often unionized, in the communities in US states. Core competencies (Racino-Lakin, 1988) at the federal-state interface for the aides "in institutions and communities" were identified in aging and physical disabilities, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and behavioral ("mental health") health in 2013 (Larson, Sedlezky, Hewitt, &amp; Blakeway, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Larson, S.A., Sedlezky, L., Hewitt, A., &amp; Blakeway, C. (2014). Chapter 10: Community support services workforce in the US. In: J. Racino, ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US'' (pp. 235-254). London, NY, NY, &amp; Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Barack Obama, US House Speaker John Boehner, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Harry Reid, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell received copies of the US Senate Commission on Long Term Care on the "issues of service delivery, workforce and financing which have challenged policymakers for decades" (Chernof &amp; Warshawsky, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Chernof, B. &amp; Warshawsky, M. (2013, September). ''Commission on Long Term Care: Report to US Congress''. Washington, DC: US Senate.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Commission envisions a "comprehensive financing model balancing private and public financing to insure catastrophic expenses, encourage savings and insurance for more immediate LTSS (Long Term Services and Supports) costs, and to provide a safety net for those without resources." (Ibid, 2013).

The direct care workforce envisioned by the MDs (physicians, prepared by a medical school, subsequently licensed for practice) in America (who did not develop the community service systems, and serve different, valued roles within it) were described in 2013 as: personal care aides (20%), home health aides (23%), nursing assistants (37%), and independent providers (20%) (p.&amp;nbsp;10).&lt;ref&gt;Litvak, S. &amp; Kennedy, J. (1991). ''Policy Issues Affecting the Medicaid Personal Care Services Optional Benefit''. Oakland, CA: World Institute on Disability.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. (1994).

(1991, December). ''Case Studies of Six State Personal Assistance Service Programs Funded by the Medicaid Personal Care Option''. Oakland, CA: World Institute on Disability.&lt;/ref&gt; The US has varying and competing health care systems, and hospitals have adopted a model to transfer "community funds into hospital"; in addition, "hospital studies" indicate M-LTSS (managed long-term care services) &lt;ref&gt;Saucier, P., Kasten, K., Burwell, B., et al. (2012). ''The Growth of Managed Long-Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) Programs''. Washington, DC: Centers for Medicaid and Medicare and Truven Health Analytics.&lt;/ref&gt; as billable services. In addition, allied health personnel preparation have formed the bulk of the preparation in specialized science and disability centers which theoretically and practically supports modernized personal assistance services across population groups (Litvak &amp; Racino, 1999) &lt;ref&gt;Litvak, S. &amp; Racino, J.

Cambridge, MA: MEDSTAT Group.&lt;/ref&gt; and "managed" behavioral health care "as a subset of" mental health services.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, W., Cohen, M., Farkas, M., &amp; Gagne, C. (2002).

''Contributions to Client-Centered Therapy and the Person-Centered Approach''. Ross-on-the-Wye, United Kingdom: PCCS Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term services and supports (LTSS) legislation was developed, as were the community services and personnel, to address the needs of "individuals with disabilities" for whom the state governments were litigated against, and in many cases, required to report regularly on the development of a community-based system.&lt;ref&gt;Dybwad, G. &amp; Bersani, H. (1996). ''New Voices: Self Advocacy for People with Disabilities''. Cambridge, MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt; These LTSS options originally bore such categorical services as residential and vocational rehabilitation or habilitation, family care or foster family care, small intermediate care facilities,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., McCord, W., &amp; Searl, S. (1981). Medicaid dollars and community homes: The community ICF/MR controversy.

Alexandria, VA: National Association of Developmental Disabilities Services, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; clinics, family support,&lt;ref&gt;Castellani, P., Downey, N.A., Tausig, M., et al. (1986). Availability and accessibility of family support services. ''Mental Retardation'', 24:71-79.&lt;/ref&gt; supportive living, and day services (Smith &amp; Racino, 1988 for the US governments).The original state departments were Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, Offices of Mental Health,&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, M. &amp; Anthony, W.

''Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin'', 24: 128-144.&lt;/ref&gt; lead designations in Departments of Health in brain injury for communities,&lt;ref&gt;Wehman, P., Booth, M., Stallard, D., et al. (1994). Return to work for persons with traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury: Three case studies. ''International Journal of Rehabilitation Research'', 17: 268-277.&lt;/ref&gt; and then, Alcohol and Substance Abuse dedicated state agencies.

Among the government and Executive initiatives were the development of supportive living internationally,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. (1990). ''Supportive Living: New Directions in Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities''. Alexandria, VA: NASMRPD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allard, M. (1996).

''Hospital and Community Psychiatry'', 44: 439-449.&lt;/ref&gt; and creative plans permeating the literature on independent living, user-directed categories (approved by US Centers for Medicaid and Medicare), expansion of home services and family support, and assisted living facilities for the aging groups. These services often have undergone a revolution in payment schemes beginning with systems for payment of valued community options (Smith &amp; Alderman, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. &amp; Alderman, S.

==Needs for long-term care==
[[File:Nursing home corridor.JPG|thumb|Nurse at a [[nursing home]] in Norway]]
Life expectancy is going up in most countries, meaning more people are living longer and entering an age when they may need care. Meanwhile, birth rates are generally falling. Globally, 70 percent of all older people now live in low or middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/ageing/en/ Ageing and Life Course.] Accessed 3 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries and [[health care system]]s need to find innovative and sustainable ways to cope with the demographic shift. As reported by John Beard, director of the [[World Health Organization]]'s Department of Ageing and Life Course, "With the rapid ageing of populations, finding the right model for long-term care becomes more and more urgent."&lt;ref name="WHO Bulletin"/&gt;

The demographic shift is also being accompanied by changing social patterns, including smaller families, different residential patterns, and increased female labour force participation. These factors often contribute to an increased need for paid care.&lt;ref&gt;London School of Economics and Political Science. [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/150246/Eurohealth-Vol17-No-2-3-Web.pdf Ageing and long-term care.] ''Eurohealth'' 2011, 17(2–3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, the largest percentages of older persons needing LTC services still rely on informal home care, or services provided by unpaid [[caregiver]]s (usually nonprofessional family members, friends or other volunteers). Estimates from the [[OECD]] of these figures often are in the 80 to 90 percent range; for example, in [[Austria]], 80 percent of all older citizens.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2005). ''Long Term Care for Older People''. Paris: OECD.&lt;/ref&gt; The similar figure for dependent elders in [[Spain]] is 82.2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Costa-Font, J., and Patxot, C. (2005). The design of the long-term care system in Spain: Policy and financial constraints. ''Soc. Society'' 4:1, 11–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] estimates that about 9 million American men and women over the age of 65 needed long-term care in 2006, with the number expected to jump to 27 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Demand for Long-Term Care in the U.S. (Updated)|url=http://www.thescanfoundation.org/sites/default/files/us_growing_demand_for_ltc_june_2012_fs.pdf|publisher=The Scan Foundation|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is anticipated that most will be cared for at home; family and friends are the sole caregivers for 70 percent of the elderly. A study by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] says that four out of every ten people who reach age 65 will enter a nursing home at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. [http://ahrq.hhs.gov/research/longtrm1.htm AHCPR Research on Long-term Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714102623/http://ahrq.hhs.gov/research/longtrm1.htm |date=2009-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly 10 percent of the people who enter a nursing home will stay there five years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Term Care|url=https://www.senioranswers.org/insurance/long-term-care/|publisher=Colorado Gerontological Society|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on projections of needs in long term care (LTC), the US 1980s demonstrations of versions of Nursing Homes Without Walls (Senator Lombardi of New York) for elders in the US were popular, but limited: On LOK, PACE, Channeling, Section 222 Homemaker, ACCESS Medicaid-Medicare, and new Social Day Care. The major argument for the new services was cost savings based upon reduction of institutionalization.&lt;ref&gt;Weasart, W.G., Cready, C.M., &amp; Pawelak, J.E. (1988, reprinted 2005). The past and future of home and community-based long term care. ''Milbank Quarterly'', 83(4): 1-71.&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations were significant in developing and integrating personal care, transportation, homemaking/meals, nursing/medical, emotional support, help with finances, and informal caregiving. Weasart concluded that: "Increased life satisfaction appears to be relatively consistent benefit of community care" and that a "prospective budgeting  model" of home and community-based long term care (LTC) used "break-even costs" to prevent institutional care.

==Long-term care costs==
A recent analysis indicates that Americans spent $219.9 billion on long-term care services for the elderly in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;National Health Policy Forum (2014) The Basics: National Spending for Long-Term Services and Supports. Retrieved (January 2015) from www.nhpf.org/library/the-basics/Basics_LTSS_03-27-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Nursing home spending accounts for the majority of long-term care expenditures, but the proportion of home and community based care expenditures has increased over the past 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, R.I., &amp; Benson, W.F., Financing and organizing health and long term care services.

The Medicaid and Medicare health care systems in the US are relatively young, celebrating 50 years in 2015. According to the ''Health Care Financing Review'' (Fall 2000), its history includes a 1967 expansion of to ensure primary and preventive services to Medicaid-eligible children (EPSDT), the use home and community-based Medicaid waivers (then HCBS services), Clinton administration health care demonstrations (under 1115 waiver authority), the new era of SCHIP to cover uninsured children and families, coverage for the HIV/AIDS population groups, and attention to ethnic and racial-based service delivery (e.g., beneficiaries). Later, managed care plans which used "intensive residential children's" options and "non-traditional out-patients services (school-based services, partial hospitalization, in-home treatment and case management) developed "behavioral health care plans".&lt;ref&gt;Cook, J., Fitzgibbon, G., Burke-Miller, J., et al. (2004, Fall). Medicaid behavioral health care plan satisfaction and children's service utilization. ''Health Care Financing Review'', 26(1): 43-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the average annual cost of nursing home care in the United States was $81,030 for a semi-private room. The average annual cost for assisted living was $42,600.  Home health aides were paid on average $12 per hour and homemaker services averaged about $20 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/mmi/publications/studies/2012/studies/mmi-2012-market-survey-long-term-care-costs.pdf 2012 MetLife Market Survey of Nursing Home, Assisted Living, Adult Day Services, and Home Care Costs], Metlife Mature Market Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The average cost of a nursing home for one year is more than the typical family has saved for retirement in a 401(k) or an IRA.&lt;ref&gt;George Washington University.

The states pay a monthly capitated rate per member to the MCOs that provide comprehensive care and accept the risk of managing total costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/states-turn-managed-care-constrain-medicaid-long-term-care-costs |title=States Turn to Managed Care To Constrain Medicaid Long-Term Care Costs |date=2014-04-09 | accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the percentage of elderly individuals in the population rises to nearly 14% in 2040 as predicted, a huge strain will be put on caregivers' finances as well as continuing care retirement facilities and nursing homes because demand will increase dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, R. (2009, 07 20).

Politically, the 21st Century has shifted to the cost of unpaid family caregiving (valued by AARP in aging at $450 billion in 2009), and the governments in the US are being asked to "foot part of the bill or costs" of caregiving for family members in home. This movement, based in part on feminist trends in the workplace, has intersected with other hospital to home, home health care and visiting nurses, user-directed services, and even hospice care. The government's Medicaid programs is considered the primary payer of ''Long Term Services and Supports'' (LTSS), according to the American Association of Retired Persons, Public Policy Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, A., Ujavri, K &amp; Fox-Grange, W. (2012, September). ''In Brief #INB 198''.

==Long-term care funding==
Governments around the world have responded to growing long-term care needs to different degrees and at different levels. These responses by governments, are based in part, upon a public policy research agenda on long term care which includes special population research, flexible models of services, and managed care models to control escalating costs and high private pay rates.&lt;ref&gt;Binstock, R. and Spector, W. (nd, 1996). ''Five Priority Areas for Research on Long-Term Care''. Washington, DC: Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.E. and Gengler, D.J. (1993, Fall).

===Europe===
Most [[Western European]] countries have put in place a mechanism to fund formal care and, in a number of [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Continental European]] countries, arrangements exist to at least partially fund informal care as well. Some countries have had publicly organized funding arrangements in place for many years: the [[Netherlands]] adopted the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (ABWZ) in 1967, and in 1988 [[Norway]] established a framework for municipal payments to informal caregivers (in certain instances making them municipal employees). Other countries have only recently put in place comprehensive national programs: in 2004, for example, [[France]] set up a specific insurance fund for dependent older people and in 2006, [[Portugal]] created a public funded national network for long-term care. Some countries ([[Spain]] and [[Italy]] in Southern Europe, [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]] in Central Europe) have not yet established comprehensive national programs, relying on informal caregivers combined with a fragmented mix of formal services that varies in quality and by location.&lt;ref name="Saltman"&gt;Saltman, R.B., Dubois, H.F.W. and Chawla, M. (2006). The impact of aging on long-term care in Europe and some potential policy responses, ''International Journal of Health Services'', 36(4): 719-746.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, some Nordic countries began making payments to informal caregivers, with [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] allowing relatives and neighbors who were providing regular home care to become municipal employees, complete with regular pension benefits. In [[Finland]], informal caregivers received a fixed fee from municipalities as well as pension payments. In the 1990s, a number of countries with social health insurance ([[Austria]] in 1994, [[Germany]] in 1996, [[Luxembourg]] in 1999) began providing a cash payment to service recipients, who could then use those funds to pay informal caregivers.&lt;ref name="Saltman"/&gt;

In Germany, funding for long-term care is covered through a mandatory insurance scheme (or ''Pflegeversicherung''), with contributions divided equally between the insured and their employers. The scheme covers the care needs of people who as a consequence of illness or disability are unable to live independently for a period of at least six months. Most beneficiaries stay at home (69%).&lt;ref name="WHO Bulletin"/&gt; The country's LTC fund may also make pension contributions if an informal caregiver works more than 14 hours per week.&lt;ref name="Saltman"/&gt;

Major reform initiatives in health care systems in Europe are based, in part on an extension of user-directed services demonstrations and approvals in the US (e.g., Cash and counseling demonstrations and evaluations).&lt;ref&gt;Doty, P., Mahoney, K.J., &amp; Simon-Rusinowitz, L. (2007, February). Designing the cash and counseling demonstration and evaluation. ''Health Service Research'', 42, No. 1.2. Retrieved 10/6/2013, 8:40 pm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2014). Individual and public budgeting. ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. (pp. 209-234). London, NY, NY and Boca Raton, FL: Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; Clare Ungerson, a Professor of Social Policy, together with Susan Yeandle, Professor of Sociology, reported on the Cash for Care Demonstrations in Nation-States in Europe (Austria, France, Italy, Netherlands, England, Germany) with a comparative USA ("paradigm of home and community care").&lt;ref&gt;Ungerson, C. &amp; Yeandle, S.

In addition, direct payment schemes were developed and implemented in the UK, including  in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, C. (2006). Direct payments in Scotland. In: J. Leece &amp; J. Bornat, ''Development in Direct Payments''. (pp. 33-48).

These "health care schemes" on the commodification of care were compared to individualised planning and direct funding in the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, P., Lord, J., &amp; Salisbury, B.

===North America===

====Canada====
In Canada, facility-based long-term care is not publicly insured under the [[Canada Health Act]] in the same way as hospital and physician services. Funding for LTC facilities is governed by the provinces and territories, which varies across the country in terms of the range of services offered and the cost coverage.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"/&gt;  In Canada, from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, there were 1,519 long-term care facilities housing 149,488 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Daily — Long-term Care Facilities Survey, 2013|url = http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150504/dq150504b-eng.htm|website = www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date = 2016-01-19|first = Government of Canada, Statistics|last = Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada-US have a long term relationship as border neighbors on health care; however Canada, similar to the UK (National Health Service), has a system of "socialized medicine" (e.g., US, Bernie Sander's Proposal for Medicare for All during the US Presidential campaign).  In the development of home and community-based services, individualised services and supports were popular in both Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, J. &amp; Hutchinson, P. (2003). Individualised support and funding: Building blocks for capacity building and inclusion. ''Disability and Society'', 18: 71-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian citations of US projects included the cash assistance programs in family support in the US, in the context of individual and family support services for children with significant needs. In contrast, the US initiatives in health care in that period involved the Medicaid waiver authority and health care demonstrations, and the use of state demonstration funds separate from the federal programs.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Bogdan, R., &amp; Racino, J. (1991). ''Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities in the Community''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H.Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Fujiura, G., Bachelder, L., &amp; Mitchell, D. (1990). ''The State of the States in Developmental Disabilities''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Long-term care is typically funded using a combination of sources including but not limited to family members, Medicaid, long-term care insurance and Medicare. One of these includes out-of-pocket spending, which often becomes exhausted once an individual requires more medical attention throughout the aging process and might need in-home care or be admitted into a nursing home. For many people, out-of-pocket spending for long-term care is a transitional state before eventually needing Medicaid coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Gale, W.G., Iwry, M., Orszag, P., Ahlstrom, A., Clements, E., Lambrew, J., Yumlinson, A. (2004) Retirement Saving and Long-Term Care Needs: An Overview.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal savings can be difficult to manage and budget and often deplete rapidly. In addition to personal savings, individuals can also rely on an [[Individual retirement account]], [[Roth IRA]], [[Pension]], [[Severance package]] or the funds of family members. These are essentially [[retirement]] packages that become available to the individual once certain requirements have been met.

In 2008, Medicaid and Medicare accounted for approximately 71% of national long-term care spending in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin Group. (2010). Individuals living in the community with chronic conditions and functional limitations: A closer look. Report prepared under contract #HHS-100-95-0046 for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.&lt;/ref&gt;  Out-of-pocket spending accounted for 18% of national long-term care spending, private long-term care insurance accounted for 7%, and other organizations and agencies accounted for the remaining expenses.  Moreover, 67% of all nursing home residents used Medicaid as their primary source of payment.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, S. R., &amp; Gibson, M. J. (2002). ''Across the States: Profiles of Long-Term Services and Supports (5th ed.)''. Washington, DC: AARP Public Policy Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private Long-Term Care Insurance in 2017 paid over $9.2 Billion in benefits and claims for these policies continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ltcnews.com/articles/long-term-care-insurance-industry-paid-huge-amount-of-benefits-in-2017&lt;/ref&gt; The largest claim to one person is reported to be over $2 million in benefits &lt;ref&gt;https://www.expertclick.com/NewsRelease/Largest-LongTerm-Care-Insurance-Claim-Being-Paid-Exceeds-2-Million,2018156809.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicaid is one of the dominant players in the nation's long-term care market because there is a failure of private insurance and Medicare to pay for expensive long-term care services, such as nursing homes.  For instance, 34% of Medicaid was spent on long-term care services in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, E., &amp; Elias, R. (2004). Medicaid and long-term care. Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicaid operates as distinct programs which involve home and community-based (Medicaid) waivers designed for special population groups during deinstitutionalization then to community, direct medical services for individuals who meet low income guidelines (held stable with the new Affordable Care Act Health Care Exchanges), facility development programs (e.g., intermediate care facilities for intellectual and developmental disabilities populations), and additional reimbursements for specified services or beds in facilities (e.g., over 63% beds in nursing facilities). Medicaid also fund traditional home health services and is payor of adult day care services. Currently, the US Centers for Medicaid and Medicare also have a user-directed option of services previously part of grey market industry.

In the US, [[Medicaid]] is a government program that will pay for certain health services and nursing home care for older people (once their assets are depleted). In most states, Medicaid also pays for some long-term care services at home and in the community. Eligibility and covered services vary from state to state. Most often, eligibility is based on income and personal resources. Individuals eligible for Medicaid are eligible for community services, such as home health, but governments have not adequately funded this option for elders who wish to remain in their homes after extended illness [[aging in place]], and Medicaid's expenses are primarily concentrated on nursing home care operated by the hospital-nursing industry in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, J., &amp; Li, A. (2002). Long Term Care Financing: Options for the Future. Benefits Quarterly, 18(2), 7-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] does not pay for long-term care. Medicare pays only for medically necessary skilled [[nursing]] facility or [[home health care]]. However, certain conditions must be met for Medicare to pay for even those types of care. The services must be ordered by a doctor and tend to be rehabilatative in nature.  Medicare specifically will not pay for custodial and non-skilled care. Medicare will typically cover only 100 skilled nursing days following a 3-day admission to a hospital.

A 2006 study conducted by [[AARP]] found that most Americans are unaware of the costs associated with long-term care and overestimate the amount that government programs such as Medicare will pay.&lt;ref&gt;AARP Press Center. [http://www.aarp.org/research/press-center/presscurrentnews/long_term_care_report.html Long-term care report]&lt;/ref&gt; The US government plans for individuals to have care from family, similar to Depression days; however, AARP reports annually on the Long-term services and supports (LTSS) &lt;ref&gt;AARP. (2012). ''Long-Term Services and Supports in the US''. Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; for aging in the US including home-delivered meals (from senior center sites) and its advocacy for caregiving payments to family caregivers.

[[Long-term care insurance]] protects individuals from asset depletion and includes a range of benefits with varying lengths of time. This type of insurance is designed to protect policyholders from the costs of long-term care services, and policies are determined using an "experience rating" and charge higher premiums for higher-risk individuals who have a greater chance of becoming ill.&lt;ref&gt;Amaradio, L. (1998). Financing Long-Term Care for Elderly Persons: What Are the Options? Journal of Health Care Finance, 25(2). 75-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now a number of different types of long term care insurance plans including traditional tax-qualified, partnership plans (providing additional dollar-for-dollar asset protect offered by most states), short-term extended care policies and hybrid plans (life or annuity policies with riders to pay for long term care).&lt;ref&gt;http://longtermcareplanningnews.com/articles/new-ltc-policy-options-available-hybrid-long-term-care-and-short-term-care&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of LTC facilities may have certain [[Nursing home residents' rights|legal rights]], including a Red Cross ombudsperson, depending on the location of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements for States and Long Term Care Facilities|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=6d9e785c91c433571919f9827481b19d&amp;node=42:5.0.1.1.2&amp;rgn=div5#42:5.0.1.1.2.2.7.1|work=ELECTRONIC CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, government funded aid meant for long-term care recipients are sometimes misused.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' explains how some of the businesses offering long-term care are misusing the loopholes in the newly redesigned New York Medicaid program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Nina|title=Medicaid Shift Fuels Rush for Profitable Clients|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/nyregion/medicaid-shift-fuels-rush-for-profitable-clients.html?_r=0|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government resists progressive oversight which involves continuing education requirements, community services administration with quality of life indicators, evidence-based services, and leadership in use of federal and state funds for the benefit of individual and their family.

For those that are poor and elderly, long term care becomes even more challenging.  Often, these individuals are categorized as "[[Medicare dual eligible|dual eligibles]]" and they qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid.  These individuals accounted for 319.5 billion in health care spending in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Coming Experiments in Integrating and Coordinating Care for 'Dual Eligibles'|last = Meyer|first = Harris|date = June 2012|journal = Health Affairs|doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0505|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MEDCIN''', a system of standardized [[medical terminology]], is a proprietary medical vocabulary and was developed by Medicomp Systems, Inc. MEDCIN is a [[point-of-care]] terminology, intended for use in [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicom Systems|url=http://www.medicomp.com|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it includes over 280,000 clinical data elements encompassing symptoms, history, physical examination, tests, diagnoses and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012AB MEDCIN Source Information|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MEDCIN/|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This clinical vocabulary contains over 38 years of research and development as well as the capability to cross map to leading codification systems such as [[SNOMED CT]], [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]], [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems#ICD-9-CM|ICD-9-CM]]/[[ICD-10-CM]], [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]],  [[LOINC]], [[Current Dental Terminology|CDT]], CVX, and the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]] for nursing and allied health.&lt;ref name="Whittenburg1"&gt;Whittenburg, L. (2012) The CCC system in medicomp’s point of care knowledge engine (MEDCIN) (pp.52) In Saba, V. (2012) Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System Version 2.5, 2nd Edition: User's Guide,  New York,NY: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MEDCIN coding system is marketed for [[point-of-care documentation]].  Several [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems embed MEDCIN, which allows them to produce structured and numerically codified patient charts.  Such structuring enables the aggregation, analysis, and mining of clinical and practice management data related to a disease, a patient or a population.

==History==

MEDCIN was initially developed by Peter S. Goltra, founder of Medicomp Systems “as an intelligent clinical database for documentation at the time of care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=S.H.|author2=Rosenbloom, S.T. |author3=Bauer, B.A. |author4=Wahner-Roedler, D. |author5=Froehling, D.A. |author6=Bailey, K.R. |author7=Lincoln, M.J. |author8=Montella, D. |author9=Fielstein, E.M. |author10=Elkin, P.L. |title=Direct Comparison of MEDCIN® and SNOMED CT® for Representation of a General Medical Evaluation Template|journal=AMA Symposium Proceedings|year=2007|pages=75–79|pmc=2655894 |pmid=18693801}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first few years of the development were spent in designing the structure of a knowledge engine that would enable the population of relationships between clinical events.
Since 1978, the MEDCIN database engine has been continuously refined and expanded to include concepts from clinical histories, test, physical examination, therapies and diagnoses to enable coding of complete patient encounters with the collaboration of physicians and teaching institutions such as Cornell, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medicomp Systems, Inc|url=http://www.medicomp.com/|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interface term"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=S.T|author2=Brown, S.H |author3=Froehling, D. |author4=Bauer, A.B. |author5=Wahner-Roedler, D.L. |author6=Gregg, W.M |author7=Elkin, P.L.  |title=Using SNOMED CT to represent two interface terminology|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association| date=February 2009 |volume=16|issue=1|pages=81–88. doi: 10.1197/jamia.M2694.|pmid=18952944|doi=10.1197/jamia.M2694 |pmc=2605600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

=== Multiple Hierarchical Structure ===

MEDCIN data elements are organized in multiple clinical hierarchies, where users can easily navigate to a medical term by following down the tree of clinical propositions. The clinical propositions define unique intellectual clinical content. An example of such similar propositions include "wheezing which is worse during cold weather" and "wheezing which is worse with a cold" differ in meaning significantly to clinicians and therefore it enables the software to present relevant items to clinical users.&lt;ref&gt;Zanstra, P.E, van der Haring, E.J, Cornet, R, (2003)[http://www.openclinical.org/docs/ext/terminologiesNL2003.pdf Introduction of a Clinical Terminology in the Netherlands: Needs, Constraints, Opportunities.]  Depts. Medical Informatics, UMC St Radboud Nijmegen, AMC Amsterdam. pg 61&lt;/ref&gt;

This hierarchy provides an inheritance of clinical properties between data elements, which greatly enhances the capabilities of EHR systems and as well providing logical presentation structures for the clinical users.&lt;ref name='Zanstra1'&gt;Zanstra, P.E, van der Haring, E.J, Cornet, R, (2003).

=== Enhances EHRs usability ===

MEDCIN has been designed to work as an interface terminology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gasch|first=A.|author2=Gasch, B.|title=Successfully choosing your EMR 15 crucial decisions|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Oxford|isbn=9781444320336|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;   to include components to make EHRs more usable when it is used in conjunction with proprietary physician and nursing documentation tools.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, S.T, Miller, R.A., Johnson, K.B., Elkin, P.L., Brown, S.H. (2008). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17947616 A Model for Evaluating Interface Terminologies.]  Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. 15:65–76. {{DOI|10.1197}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosenbloom et al. (2006), investigators such as Chute et al., McDonald et al., Rose et al. and Campbell et al. have defined clinical interface terminologies as “a systematic collection of health care-related phrases (term)” (p.&amp;nbsp;277)  that supports the capturing of patient-related clinical information entered by clinicians into software programs such as clinical note capture and decision support tools.&lt;ref name='Rosenbloom'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=S.T. |author2=Miller,R.A. |author3=Johnson, K.B.|author4=Elkin, P.L. |author5=Brown, S.H.|title=Interface Terminologies: Facilitating Direct Entry of Clinical Data into Electronic Health Record Systems|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|year=2006|volume=13|issue=3|pages=277–288|pmc=1513664|doi=10.1197/jamia.m1957|pmid=16501181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an interface terminology to be clinical usable, it has to be able to describe any clinical presentation with speed, ease of use, and accuracy for clinicians to accomplish the intended tasks (e.g. documenting patient care) when using the medical terminology.&lt;ref name='Rosenbloom'/&gt; In addition, the terms in medical terminology must have medical relationships.&lt;ref  name="Zanstra2"/&gt;  MEDCIN’s presentation engine, accomplishes this usability criteria by using the Intelligent Prompting capabilities to present a relevant list of MEDCIN clinical terms for rapid clinical documentations. Another usability feature that the MEDCIN presentation engine provides is the medical relationships of clinical terms through multiple clinical hierarchies for each MEDCIN term.&lt;ref name="Zanstra2"/&gt;

=== Support for ICD-10-CM coding ===

In August 2012, Medicomp Systems released an updated version of the software embedded with [[ICD-10 Clinical Modification|ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification)]] mappings and functionality to comply with the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM as mandated by the US Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICD-10 Code Set to Replace ICD-9|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/hipaahealth-insurance-portability-accountability-act/transaction-code-set-standards/icd10-code-set.page?|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medicomp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Medicomp?|url=http://www.medicomp.com/why-medicomp/|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new  version is specially designed to make the [[ICD 10|ICD-10]] more usable in the EHR systems by providing clinicians easier access to bi-directional mappings, accurate data and codes through their EHR products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicomp Releases ICD-10-CM with New Version of the Powerful MEDCIN Engine® (2011)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medicomp-releases-icd-10-cm-with-new-version-of-the-powerful-medcin-engine-128470243.html|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD-10 is published by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]]  to enable the systematic collection of morbidity and mortality data from different countries for statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coiera|first=Enrico|title=Guide to Health Informatics. 2nd edition|year=2003|publisher=Hodder Arnold|location=London, UK|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integration to most EHRs and Legacy systems ===

MEDCIN terminology engine can be easily integrated into existing EHRs and legacy systems to enable mapping of existing terminologies and other coding systems such as [[ICD]], [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]], [[LOINC]], [[SNOMED CT]] and the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]] to generate seamless codified data  at point of care.&lt;ref name="Zanstra1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="medicomp"/&gt;  MEDCIN’s interoperability features enable easy access and sharing of patient data between health care facilities.

==Interface with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems==

MEDCIN has been implemented into several commercial EHR systems as an interface terminology to support integrated care, clinical documentation, health maintenance monitoring and disease management, and the care planning functions of physicians, nurses and [[Allied health professions|allied health professionals]].&lt;ref name="interface term"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"&gt;Whittenburg, L. (2012) The CCC system in medicomp’s point of care knowledge engine (MEDCIN®) (pp.51-53). In Saba, V. (2012) Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System Version 2.5, 2nd Edition: User's Guide, New York,NY: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such commercial EHR systems include EHRs from EPIC, Allscripts, Pulse, Mckesson, and the United States Department of Defence’s (DoD) EHR system, the [[AHLTA|Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)]].


=== AHLTA ===

[[File:Screenshot of AHLTA and MEDCIN terminology engine.png|thumb|Figure 1: AHLTA and MEDCIN terminology systems]]
[[AHLTA]] is an EHR system developed for the US Department of Defense. This application uses the Medicomp’s MEDCIN terminology engine for clinical documentation purposes. &lt;span style="color: black"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/span&gt;, shows an example of the MEDCIN terminology where the physician can search for the correct terms for input into the patient note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoyt|first=R.E |author2=Sutton, M., |author3=Yoshihashi, S.A., (eds)|title=Medical informatics practical guide for the healthcare professional|url=http://remongameel.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/medicalinformatics_third_edition_bookmarked_e_book_lulu.pdf|year=2009|publisher=Lulu.com|location=Pensacola, Florida|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MEDCIN Nursing Plan of Care ==

[[File:MEDCIN nursing plan of care.png|thumb|Figure 2: MEDCIN plan of care with nursing diagnoses]]
The Nursing Plan of Care (POC)  was developed by Medicomp Systems, for the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]].&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"/&gt;  The CCC System is a standardized, coded nursing terminology that provides a unique [[Clinical Care Classification System#The CCC System Framework|framework]] and coding structure for accessing, classifying and documenting patient care by nurses and other [[Allied health professions|allied health professionals]].&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K. (2005). Clinical Care Classification (CCC) of Nursing Interventions. Retrieved 25 May 2013, from http://www.sabacare.com/About/.&lt;/ref&gt; The CCC is directly linked in the MEDCIN nursing POC to medical terminology with the purpose of creating patient plan of care by extracting a pool of documentation from the EHR history.&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"/&gt; The CCC nursing terminology is integrated into the MEDCIN clinical database through a contextual hierarchical tree, providing an array of terminology standards and concepts with Intelligent Prompting capabilities of the MEDCIN engine.&lt;ref&gt;Whittenburg, L.

'''Mad Pride''' is a mass movement of the users of [[mental health]] services, former users, and the aligned, and that individuals with mental illness should be proud of their 'mad' identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2017/03/healing-voices-mad-pride/|title=The Power of 'Healing Voices'|publisher=The Mighty|first=Oryx|last=Cohen|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 1993 in response to local community prejudices towards people with a psychiatric history living in boarding homes in the Parkdale area of [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, and an event has been held every year since then in the city except for 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csinfo.ca/bulletin.html  |first=Geoffrey |last=Reaume |title=A History of Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day during the 1990s |publisher=The Consumer/Survivor Information Resource Centre Bulletin, No. 374 |date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar movement began around the same time in the United Kingdom. By the late 1990s similar events were being organized under the Mad Pride name around the globe, including Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, Madagascar, South Africa and the United States. Events draw thousands of participants, according to [[MindFreedom International]], a United States mental health advocacy organization that promotes and tracks events spawned by the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html?partner=rssnyt 'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride activists seek to reclaim terms such as "[[Insanity|mad]]", "[[nutter (disambiguation)|nutter]]", and "[[psychosis|psycho]]" from misuse, such as in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers and in order to switch it from a negative view into a positive view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html|title=Mad Pride’ Fights a Stigma|publisher=New York Times|first=Gabriell|last=Glaser|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=19 September 2018|deadurl= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a series of [[mass media]] campaigns, Mad Pride activists seek to re-educate the general public on such subjects as the causes of [[mental disorder|mental disabilities]], the experiences of those using the mental health system, and the global [[suicide]] pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  One of Mad Pride's founding activists in the UK was [[Pete Shaughnessy]], who later died by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalmagazine.co.uk/pete_shaughnessy.htm#petemain Pete Shaughnessy r.i.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Roberts, [[Robert Dellar]] (who died in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/activists-mourn-robert-dellar-co-founder-of-mad-pride-and-a-tenacious-force-for-good/|title=Activists mourn Robert Dellar, co-founder of Mad Pride and a ‘tenacious force for good’|date=2016-12-22|work=Disability News Service|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Simon Barnet were among the other founders of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mad-pride-remembering-the-uks-mental-health-pride-movement&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'' records the early Mad Pride movement.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore R Curtis |year=1996 |title=Mad Pride |publisher=Spare Change Books |location=Hackney, London |isbn=0-95257-445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Our Own: Patient-Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System'', published in 1978 by [[Judi Chamberlin]], is a foundational text in the Mad Pride movement, although it was published before the movement was launched.&lt;ref name="TBG"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=J.M.|title=Judi Chamberlin, writings took on mental health care|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/arlington/articles/2010/01/20/judi_chamberlin_writings_took_on_mental_health_care/?page=full|accessdate=4 March 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known event, specifically organized as a Pride event by people who identified as [[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors, consumers or ex-patients of psychiatric practices]], was held on 18 September 1993, when it was called "Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day".

==[[Mad Studies]]==
[[Mad Studies]] grew out of Mad Pride and survivor thinking, and focuses on developing scholarly thinking around "mental health" by academics who self-identify as mad. As noted in ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'' (LeFrançois, Menzies and Reaume, 2013),&lt;ref name="brenda"&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'', Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mad Studies can be defined in general terms as a project of inquiry, knowledge production, and political action devoted to the critique and transcendence of psy-centred ways of thinking, behaving, relating, and being".&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;{{rp|13}}  As a book, {{"'}}Mad Matters' offers a critical discussion of mental health and madness in ways that demonstrate the struggles, oppression, resistance, agency and perspectives of Mad people to challenge dominant understandings of ‘mental illness’".&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;Mark Anthony Castrodale (2014) "Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies", ''Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research'', {{doi|10.1080/15017419.2014.895415}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  "''Mad Studies'' is a growing, evolving, multi-voiced and interdisciplinary field of activism, theory, praxis and scholarship."&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

== History ==
Mad Pride was launched alongside a book of the same name, ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'', published in 2000.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride" /&gt;  On May 11, 2008, Gabrielle Glaser documented Mad Pride in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gabrielle Glaser |title='Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma |work= The New York Times |date= May 11, 2008 | publisher= The New York Times Company |access-date= May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glaser stated, "Just as gay-rights activists reclaimed the word [[queer]] as a [[gay pride|badge of honor]] rather than a slur, these advocates proudly call themselves mad; they say their conditions do not preclude them from productive lives."

=== Early origins ===
[[Elizabeth Packard]] (1816-1897) was deemed insane by her husband as she did not agree with his conservative political views. In Illinois at the time, involuntary admission to an asylum did not require a public hearing so long as it was a husband admitting his wife.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt; Due to this, Packard was institutionalized though she saw herself to be sane. In Packard’s lifetime to be labeled as ‘mad’ was a form of social disapproval. However, she felt solidarity among Mad people due to her experience in the institution. Though she did not personally identify as Mad and had to identify as ‘sane’ in order to be an activist, it is here that we see early forms of organizing from ex-patients.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;

==Mad culture and events==
[[File:2016-05-16-Mad Pride Köln 2016-4988.jpg|thumb|Bed Push at Mad Pride parade in Cologne, Germany, in 2016]]
The Mad Pride movement has spawned recurring cultural events in [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and other cities around the world.  These events often include music, poetry readings, film screenings, and [[street theatre]], such as "bed push" protests, which aim to raise awareness about the poor levels of choice of treatments and the widespread [[Involuntary treatment|use of force]] in [[psychiatric hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedpush.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 The Great Escape Bed Push]&lt;/ref&gt; Past events have included British journalist [[Jonathan Freedland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |title=Glad to be 'mad'? |work=The Guardian |first=Jo |last=Brand |date=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104141912/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |archivedate=November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular novelist Clare Allan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misplaced pride |work=Guardian Unlimited |first=Clare |last=Allan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1881476,00.html |date=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109101343/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0%2C%2C1881476%2C00.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mad Pride cultural events take a variety of forms, such as the South London collective Creative Routes, the Chipmunka Publishing enterprise, and the many works of Dolly Sen.&lt;ref&gt;Dolly Sen (October 2002) ''World Is Full of Laughter:  1 Million People Commit Suicide Every Year'', Chipmunka Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-95422-181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bed push===
[[File:peteshaughnessy.jpg|thumb|A flyer for a 2003 Mad Pride event.]]
A Bed Push is a method of activism employed by multiple mental health agencies and advocates as a method of raising awareness about psychiatric care. Activists wheel a gurney through public spaces to provoke discussion about mental health care. [[Mind Freedom]] has a recipe for a successful Bed Push on their website, urging participants to remain peaceful but also be seen by blowing horns, slightly disrupting traffic and playing music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/madpride/other-info/how-to/bed-push-tips&lt;/ref&gt; Often patients in psychiatric care feel silenced and powerless, showing resilience in the face of that and securing visibility is a method of regaining dignity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf-journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride Week in Toronto is proclaimed as such by the city itself.&lt;ref name="blogto.com"&gt;http://www.blogto.com/city/2009/07/mad_pride_breaks_the_stigma_of_mental_illness/&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities surrounding this week are highlighted by the Mad Pride Bed Push, typically on the 14th of July. The event takes place Toronto’s Queen Street West “to raise public awareness about the use of force and lack of choice for people ensnared in the Ontario mental health system” &lt;ref&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies, Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This week is officially run by Toronto Mad Pride which partners a number of mental health agencies in the city. In recent years, some advocates have pushed for [[Parkdale, Toronto]] to be renamed MAD! Village, to reclaim pride in its surrounding communities' long history of struggle with mental health and addictions &lt;ref name="blogto.com"/&gt;

A series of bed push events take place around London each year.

=== Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours ===
The Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours take place in Toronto, ON at the CAMH facility on Queen St West. The tours show the patient built walls from the 19th century that are located at present day CAMH. The purpose of the tours is to give a history on the lives of the patients who built the walls, and bring attention to the harsh realities of psychiatry.

Geoffrey Reaume and Heinz Klein first came up with the idea of walking tours as part of a Mad Pride event in 2000. The first wall tour occurred on what is now known as Mad Pride Day, on July 14, 2000, with an attendance of about fifty people. Reaume solely leads the tours, and they have grown from annual events for Mad Pride, to occurring several times throughout the year in all non-winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://activehistory.ca/papers/historypaper-10/|title=Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, 2000 – 2010|date=2011-04-19|work=ActiveHistory.ca|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">'''Mandated choice''' or '''mandatory choice''' is an approach to public policy questions in which people are required by law to state in advance whether or not they are willing to engage in a particular action.  The approach contrasts with "opt-in" and "opt-out" ("presumed consent") models of policy formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2008/10/27/remedying-donor-organ-complications-91466-22122353/ Remedying donor organ complications]&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach has most frequently been applied to cadaveric organ donation,&lt;ref&gt;Herz, Susan.  Two Steps to Three Choices: A New Approach to Mandated Choice, ''Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics'' (1999), 8 : 340-347 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; but has increasingly been considered for [[advance directives]] as well.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Appel, Jacob M.  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/the-ultimate-prescription_b_247558.html The Ultimate Prescription: Make Us Decide How We Want To Die], July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  One bioethicist, in advocating for a mandatory choice model for [[living wills]], argues that "while all Americans should have a right to decide how they want their lives to end, it does not follow that they should be able to avoid confronting such a choice."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==History==

One of the first considerations of mandated choice appeared in [[Great Britain]]'s Gore Report, a 1989-1990 study funded by the British Department of Health. From 2011 all those applying for or renewing driving licences online in the UK are required to state whether they wished to donate their organs.&lt;ref&gt;Organ donated 'nudge' for drivers in new DVLA process, BBC, July 31, 2011 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14341553, accessed July 31, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] endorsed a mandated choice model for organ donation in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Taking organs without asking, Chicago Tribune, July 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicalities==
It has been suggested that individuals could be compelled to choose as part of tax returns, driver's licence applications, and/or state benefits claims.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==

A 1992 survey found that 90% of American college students favored a mandated choice model for organ donation, compared with only 60% who favored presumed consent.&lt;ref&gt;Spital, Aaron.

{{Infobox manganese}}
'''Manganese''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Mn''' and [[atomic number]] 25. It is not found as a [[free element]] in nature; it is often found in [[mineral]]s in combination with [[iron]]. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal [[alloy]] uses, particularly in [[stainless steel]]s.

Historically, manganese is named for [[pyrolusite]] and other black minerals from the region of [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] in Greece, which also gave its name to [[magnesium]] and the [[iron]] ore [[magnetite]]. By the mid-18th century, [[Sweden|Swedish-]][[Germanic peoples|German]] [[chemist]] [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] had used pyrolusite to produce [[chlorine]]. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be [[manganese dioxide]]) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

[[Phosphate conversion coating|Manganese phosphating]] is used for rust and corrosion prevention on [[steel]]. Ionized manganese is used industrially as [[pigment]]s of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The [[permanganate]]s of [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the [[cathode]] (electron acceptor) material in [[Zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon]] and [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]].

In biology, manganese(II) ions function as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for a large variety of [[enzymes]] with many functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth |first1=Jerome |last2=Ponzoni |first2=Silvia |last3=Aschner |first3=Michael|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|chapter=Chapter 6 Manganese Homeostasis and Transport|title=Metallomics and the Cell |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_6}} electronic-book {{ISBN|978-94-007-5561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of [[superoxide]] free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental [[oxygen]]. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic [[plants]]. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a [[neurotoxin]] in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause [[manganism]], a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of manganese}}
Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn. Eighteen [[radioisotope]]s have been isolated and described, ranging in [[atomic weight]] from 46 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Mn) to 65 u (&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;Mn). The most stable are &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years, &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a half-life of 312.3 days, and &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Mn with a half-life of 5.591 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives of less than three hours, and the majority of less than one minute. The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta decay]].&lt;ref name="Audi" /&gt; Manganese also has three [[meta state]]s.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Audi|first=Georges|title=The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=729|issue=1|pages=3–128 |date=2003 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

Manganese is part of the [[iron]] group of elements, which are thought to be synthesized in large [[star]]s shortly before the [[supernova]] explosion. &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn decays to &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;[[chromium|Cr]] with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn is relatively rare, produced by [[cosmic rays]] impact on [[iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Jeorg|last2=Faestermann |first2=Thomas |title=Terrestrial manganese-53 – A new monitor of Earth surface processes |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=251|issue=3–4 |pages=334–345|date=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.016 |bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.251..334S |last3=Herzog |first3=Gregory F. |last4=Knie |first4=Klaus |last5=Korschinek |first5=Gunther |last6=Masarik |first6=Jozef |last7=Meier |first7=Astrid |last8=Poutivtsev |first8=Michail |last9=Rugel |first9=Georg |last10=Schlüchter |first10=Christian |last11=Serifiddin |first11=Feride |last12=Winckler |first12=Gisela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with [[chromium]] isotopic contents and have found application in [[isotope geology]] and [[radiometric dating]]. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from [[Aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] and [[Palladium-107|&lt;sup&gt;107&lt;/sup&gt;Pd]] for the early history of the [[solar system]]. Variations in &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr/&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several [[meteorite]]s suggest an initial &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn/&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn ratio, which indicates that Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from ''in situ'' decay of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn provides additional evidence for [[nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthetic]] processes immediately before coalescence of the [[solar system]].&lt;ref name="Audi" /&gt;&lt;!-- {{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00312-9 |title=53Mn-53Cr evolution of the early solar system|year=1999|last1=Birck|first1=J. |last2=Rotaru|last3=Allègre|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=63|pages=4111|first2=M.|first3=C.|bibcode=1999GeCoA..63.4111B |issue=23–24}}{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(98)00189-6|title=Early solar system timescales according to 53Mn-53Cr systematics |year=1998|last1=Lugmair |first1=G.|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=62|pages=2863|bibcode=1998GeCoA..62.2863L|issue=16 |last2=Shukolyukov |first2=A.}}{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1005243228503|year=2000|last1=Shukolyukov|first1=Alexander|last2=Lugmair |journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=92|pages=225|first2=Günter W.|bibcode=2000SSRv...92..225S}}{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gca.2008.03.023|title=53Mn–53Cr systematics of the early Solar System revisited|year=2008|last1=Trinquier|first1=A. |last2=Birck|last3=Allègre|last4=Göpel|last5=Ulfbeck |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=72|pages=5146|first2=J.|first3=C. |first4=C.|first5=D.|bibcode=2008GeCoA..72.5146T |issue=20}}--&gt;

The most common [[oxidation state]]s of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; often competes with Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly restricted to the unstable oxide Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and a few oxyhalides (MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F and MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), are powerful [[oxidation|oxidizing agents]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt; Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to [[disproportionation]].

The most stable oxidation state for manganese is +2, which has a pale pink color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as [[manganese(II) sulfate]] (MnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[manganese(II) chloride]] (MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite ([[manganese(II) carbonate]]). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are a few examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II).&lt;ref name="Saha 1703–1708"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saha|first=Amrita|last2=Majumdar|first2=Partha|last3=Goswami|first3=Sreebrata|title=Low-spin manganese(II) and cobalt(III) complexes of N-aryl-2-pyridylazophenylamines: new tridentate N,N,N-donors derived from cobalt mediated aromatic ring amination of 2-(phenylazo)pyridine.

The +3 oxidation state is known in compounds like [[manganese(III) acetate]], but these are quite powerful [[Redox|oxidizing agents]] and also prone to [[disproportionation]] in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the [[Jahn-Teller effect]].

The oxidation state +5 can be produced by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten [[sodium nitrite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. B. |last=Temple|author2=Thickett, G.

Permanganate (+7 oxidation state) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. [[Potassium permanganate]], [[sodium permanganate]], and [[barium permanganate]] are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory [[reagent]] because of its oxidizing properties; it is used as a topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.2.6.799 |last=Luft |first=J.

==History==
The origin of the name manganese is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] (located within modern Greece) were both called ''magnes'' from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male ''magnes'' attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as [[lodestone]] or [[magnetite]], and which probably gave us the term [[magnet]]. The female ''magnes'' ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine ''magnes'' was later called ''magnesia'', known now in modern times as [[pyrolusite]] or [[manganese dioxide]]. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called ''manganesum'' (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a ''magnesia negra'' (the black ore) from ''magnesia alba'' (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). [[Michele Mercati]] called magnesia negra ''manganesa'', and finally the metal isolated from it became known as ''manganese'' (German: ''Mangan''). The name ''magnesia'' eventually was then used to refer only to the white [[magnesia alba]] (magnesium oxide), which provided the name [[magnesium]] for the free element when it was isolated much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=J.

Several colorful oxides of manganese, for example [[Manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]], are abundant in nature and have been used as pigments since the [[Stone Age]]. The cave paintings in [[Gargas, Haute-Garonne|Gargas]] that are 30,000 to 24,000 years old contain manganese pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00339-006-3510-7|title=Minerals discovered in paleolithic black pigments by transmission electron microscopy and micro-X-ray absorption near-edge structure|date=2006|last1=Chalmin|first1=E.|last2=Vignaud|first2=C. |last3=Salomon|first3=H.|last4=Farges|first4=F.|last5=Susini|first5=J. |last6= Menu|first6=M.|journal=Applied Physics A|volume=83 |pages=213–218|issue=12|bibcode=2006ApPhA..83..213C|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/67458/1/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers, either to add to, or remove color from glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.133.3467.1824|date=1961|last=Sayre|first=E.

[[File:Gahn Johan Gottlieb.jpg|thumb|Credit for first isolating manganese is usually given to [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]].]]

Because it was used in glassmaking, [[Manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. [[Ignatius Gottfried Kaim]] (1770) and [[Johann Glauber]] (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to [[permanganate]], a useful laboratory reagent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Centaurus|volume=19|issue=4|title=The Discovery of an Element|first=E.|last=Rancke-Madsen|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1975.tb00329.x|pages=299–313|date=1975|bibcode=1975Cent...19..299R}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] used manganese dioxide to produce [[chlorine]]. First, [[hydrochloric acid]], or a mixture of dilute [[sulfuric acid]] and [[sodium chloride]] was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the [[Leblanc process]] was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the [[Weldon process]]. The production of chlorine and [[hypochlorite]] [[bleach]]ing agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.

Scheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].

The manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the [[Sparta]]n steel exceptionally hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajim.20524|date=2007|title=From lead to manganese through mercury: mythology, science, and lessons for prevention|volume=50|issue=11|pages=779–787 |journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|pmid=17918211|last1=Alessio|first1=L.|last2=Campagna|first2=M.|last3=Lucchini|first3=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic [[James Couper (academic)|James Couper]] noted an association between miners' heavy exposure to manganese with a form of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"/&gt; In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Production of Manganese Ferroalloys|publisher=Tapir Academic Press |date=2007|isbn=978-82-519-2191-6|chapter=History of omanganese|pages=11–12|author=Olsen, Sverre E.|author2=Tangstad, Merete |author3=Lindstad, Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the [[Leclanché cell]] in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic [[depolarizer]] increased the demand for manganese dioxide. Until the development of batteries with [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The [[zinc-carbon battery]] and the [[alkaline battery]] normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because naturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, [[manganese(IV) oxide|manganese dioxide]] was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.&lt;ref name="ChiuZMnO2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ciuz.19800140502|title=Moderne Verfahren der Großchemie: Braunstein |date=1980|last=Preisler|first=Eberhard|journal=Chemie in Unserer Zeit|language=German|volume=14|pages=137–148|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite ([[manganese(IV) oxide|MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores.&lt;ref name="Holl" /&gt; Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, [[Gabon]] and Brazil.&lt;ref name=USGSMCS2009 /&gt; According to 1978 estimate, the [[ocean floor]] has 500 billion tons of [[manganese nodule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.micron.2008.10.005|pages=350–358|date=2009|title=Manganese/polymetallic nodules: micro-structural characterization of exolithobiontic- and endolithobiontic microbial biofilms by scanning electron microscopy|volume=40 |issue=3|pmid=19027306|journal=Micron |author1=Wang, X|author2=Schröder, HC|author3=Wiens, M|author4=Schlossmacher, U|author5=Müller, WEG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Manganese Nodules: Dimensions and Perspectives|publisher=Springer|date=1978|isbn =978-90-277-0500-6|author=United Nations Ocean Economics and Technology Office, Technology Branch, United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA once used mining manganese modules on the ocean floor as a cover story for recovering a sunken Soviet submarine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42994812|title=The CIA secret on the ocean floor|date=2018-02-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, most identified deposits are located near [[Hotazel]] in the [[Northern Cape Province]], with a 2011 estimate of 15 billion tons.

For the production of [[ferromanganese]], the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace.&lt;ref name="IndMin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial Minerals &amp; Rocks: Commodities, Markets, and Uses |edition=7th|publisher=SME|date=2006|isbn=978-0-87335-233-8|chapter=Manganese|first=L.

A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850&amp;nbsp;°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of [[sulfuric acid]] and ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form [[iron hydroxide]] and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.&lt;ref name="ManganeseRecovery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/American-Manganese-Phase-II-August-19-2010-Final-Report-Internet-Version-V2.pdf|title=The Recovery of Manganese from low grade resources: bench scale metallurgical test program completed|date=2010|author=Chow, Norman|author2=Nacu, Anca|author3=Warkentin, Doug|author4=Aksenov, Igor|author5=Teh, Hoe|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Kemetco Research Inc.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202065633/http://www.americanmanganeseinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/American-Manganese-Phase-II-August-19-2010-Final-Report-Internet-Version-V2.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s [[Project Azorian]], through billionaire [[Howard Hughes]], commissioned the ship ''[[Hughes Glomar Explorer]]'' with the cover story of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor. That triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules, which was not actually practical. The real mission of ''Hughes Glomar Explorer'' was to raise a sunken [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] submarine, the [[Soviet submarine K-129 (1960)|K-129]], with the goal of retrieving Soviet code books.&lt;ref name="azorian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb305/index.htm |title=Project Azorian: The CIA's Declassified History of the Glomar Explorer |publisher=National Security Archive at George Washington University |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy.&lt;ref name=USGSMCS2009/&gt; In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), [[zinc]] and sometimes [[vanadium]] are viable substitutes.

===Steel===
[[File:M1917helmet.jpg|thumb|U.S. M1917 [[combat helmet]], a variant of [[Brodie helmet]], made from [[Hadfield steel]] manganese alloy.]]
Manganese is essential to iron and [[steelmaking|steel production]] by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, [[deoxidized steel|deoxidizing]], and [[alloying]] properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist [[Robert Forester Mushet]] (1811–1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of [[Spiegeleisen]], into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. [[Steelmaking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-87170-858-8|pages=56–57|first=John D. |last=Verhoeven|date=2007|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, Ohio|title=Steel metallurgy for the non-metallurgist}}&lt;/ref&gt; including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand.&lt;ref name="hydrometI"/&gt; Manganese is a key component of low-cost [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="MangUSGS2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02648339|title=Mechanism of work hardening in Hadfield manganese steel|date=1981|last=Dastur|first=Y.

C.|issue=5|bibcode=1981MTA....12..749D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[ferromanganese]] (usually about 80% manganese) is the intermediate in modern processes.

Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid [[iron sulfide]] at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high [[tensile strength]] of up to 863&amp;nbsp;MPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-1-4086-2616-0 |pages=351–352|title=Iron and Steel|first=John Henry|last=Stansbie|publisher=Read Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FyogLqUxW1cC&amp;pg=PA351|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-07-136076-0|pages=585–587|last=Brady|first=George S.|author2=Clauser, Henry R. |author3=Vaccari.

===Aluminium alloys===
{{Main|Aluminium alloy}}
The second largest application for manganese is in aluminium alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased resistance to corrosion through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to [[galvanic corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suppliersonline.com/propertypages/2024.asp|title=Chemical properties of 2024 aluminum allow|accessdate=2009-04-30 |publisher=Metal Suppliers Online, LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corrosion-resistant [[aluminium alloy]]s 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most [[beverage can]]s.&lt;ref name="Al3004"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to aluminum alloys and tempers|first=John Gilbert |last=Kaufman|publisher=ASM International|date=2000|isbn=978-0-87170-689-8|chapter=Applications for Aluminium Alloys and Tempers |pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/?id=idmZIDcwCykC&amp;pg=PA93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2000, more than 1.6 million [[tonne]]s of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.{{failed verification|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref name="Al3004" /&gt;

===Other uses===
[[Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] is used as an additive in [[unleaded gasoline]] to boost [[octane rating]] and reduce [[engine knocking]]. The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leigh A. Graham|author2=Alison R. Fout|author3=Karl R. Kuehne|author4=Jennifer L.

[[Manganese(IV) oxide]] (manganese dioxide, MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is used as a reagent in [[organic chemistry]] for the [[oxidation]] of benzylic [[alcohol]]s (where the [[hydroxyl]] group is adjacent to an [[aromatic ring]]). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination.&lt;ref name="ItGlass"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11837-998-0024-0|title=Glassmaking in renaissance Italy: The innovation of venetian cristallo|date=1998|last=Mccray |first=W.

In some preparations, it is a brown [[pigment]] for [[paint]] and is a constituent of natural [[umber]].

[[Manganese(IV) oxide]] was used in the original type of dry cell [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon–zinc type flashlight cells. The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery.&lt;ref name="BattHist"/&gt;

The same material also functions in newer [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]] (usually battery cells), which use the same basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000&amp;nbsp;tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose.&lt;ref name="ChiuZMnO2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BattHist"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-2738(00)00722-0|title=Batteries fifty years of materials development|date=2000|last=Dell|first=R.

The metal is occasionally used in coins; until 2000, the only United States coin to use manganese was the [[Jefferson nickel#1938–1945: Early minting; World War II changes|"wartime" nickel]] from 1942 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Western Journal of Medicine |date=2001|volume=175|issue=2|pages=112–114|first=Raymond T.|last=Kuwahara|author2=Skinner III, Robert B. |author3=Skinner Jr., Robert B. |title=Nickel coinage in the United States|doi=10.1136/ewjm.175.2.112|pmid=11483555|pmc=1071501}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins. However, because of shortage of nickel metal during the war, it was substituted by more available silver and manganese, thus resulting in an alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. Since 2000, [[Dollar (United States coin)|dollar coins]], for example the [[Sacagawea dollar]] and the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Presidential $1 coins]], are made from a brass containing 7% of manganese with a pure copper core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/golden_dollar_coin/index.cfm?action=sacDesign|title=Design of the Sacagawea dollar|publisher=United States Mint |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases of nickel and dollar, the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin in the mechanisms of vending machines. In the case of the later U.S. dollar coins, the manganese alloy was intended to duplicate the properties of the copper/nickel alloy used in the previous [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]]. &lt;!--The EU uses manganese in 1 and 2 Euro coins, due to greater and cheaper availability.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}--&gt;

Manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass.

Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III).&lt;ref name="ItGlass" /&gt; Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.

Manganese is an important element for human health, essential for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as [[manganism]], a [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="Emsley2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daiana|last1=Silva Avila|first2=Robson|last2=Luiz Puntel|first3=Michael|last3=Aschner|editor=Astrid Sigel|editor2=Helmut Sigel |editor3=Roland K.

The [[reverse transcriptase]]s of many [[retrovirus]]es (though not [[lentivirus]]es such as [[HIV]]) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing [[polypeptides]] may be [[arginase]], the [[diphtheria toxin]], and Mn-containing [[superoxide dismutase]] ([[Mn-SOD]]).&lt;ref name="Mnzym"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0898-8838(08)60152-X|title=Manganese Redox Enzymes and Model Systems: Properties, Structures, and Reactivity|date=1998|last=Law|first=N.|volume=46|page=305|last2=Caudle|first2=M.|last3=Pecoraro|first3=V.|series=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|isbn=9780120236466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mn-SOD is the type of SOD present in eukaryotic [[mitochondria]], and also in most bacteria (this fact is in keeping with the bacterial-origin theory of mitochondria). The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}), formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' and related [[lactobacillus|lactobacilli]], which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.

The human body contains about 12&amp;nbsp;mg of manganese, mostly in the bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="Emsley2001"/&gt; In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese [[metalloprotein]]s, most notably [[glutamine synthetase]] in [[astrocyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0165-0173(02)00234-5|title=Manganese action in brain function|date=2003 |last=Takeda |first=A.|journal=Brain Research Reviews|volume=41|issue=1|pmid=12505649|pages=79–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manganese is also important in photosynthetic [[oxygen evolution]] in [[chloroplast]]s in plants. The [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) is a part of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts; it is responsible for the terminal [[Oxygen evolution|photooxidation of water]] during the [[light reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]], and has a metalloenzyme core containing four atoms of manganese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Umena|first=Yasufumi|last2=Kawakami|first2=Keisuke|last3=Shen|first3=Jian-Ren|last4=Kamiya |first4=Nobuo|title=Crystal structure of oxygen-evolving photosystem II at a resolution of 1.9 Å|journal=Nature|volume=473|issue=7345|pages=55–60|doi=10.1038/nature09913|pmid=21499260|date=May 2011|bibcode=2011Natur.473...55U}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Dismukes|first=G.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for minerals in 2001. For manganese there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for [[Adequate Intake]]s (AIs). As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11&amp;nbsp;mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref name=MnDRI&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Manganese|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/12 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Chromium, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Chromium|publisher= National Academy Press|year= 2001|pages=394–419|pmid=25057538|isbn=978-0-309-07279-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manganese deficiency is rare.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/manganese |title=Manganese|work=Micronutrient Information Center|publisher=[[Oregon State University]] [[Linus Pauling Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For people ages 15 and older the AI is set at 3.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 3.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 0.5 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient information to set a UL.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV).

The permanganate exhibits a higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10&amp;nbsp;g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to [[necrosis]] of the [[mucous membrane]]. For example, the [[esophagus]] is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only a limited amount is absorbed by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/emj.14.1.43|title=Potassium permanganate poisoning – a rare cause of fatal self poisoning|date=1997|last=Ong|first=K.

[[Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl]] (MMT) is a [[gasoline]] additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines to improve the [[octane rating]] of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces [[Engine knocking|engine knock]] agent through the action of the [[Carbonyl|carbonyl groups]]. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage [[exhaust valve]]s. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (2012) [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp151-c6.pdf 6.

==Role in neurological disorders==

===Manganism===
{{Main|Manganism}}
Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with [[manganism]], a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys&lt;ref&gt;Baselt, R.

Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In its early stages, an intoxicated person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms give way to late-stage manganism, which resembles [[Parkinson's disease]]. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance.&lt;ref name="Couper 1837 41–42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cersosimo 2007 340–346"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cersosimo|first=M.

===Childhood developmental disorders===
Several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low-dose manganese overexposure on [[child development]]. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L by the [[World Health Organization]], the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.&lt;ref name="Bouchard 138–143" /&gt;

The current maximum safe concentration under EPA rules is 50&amp;nbsp;µg Mn/L.&lt;ref name="EPA drinking water"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking Water Contaminants|url=http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurodegenerative diseases===
A protein called [[DMT1]] is the major transporter in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese across the [[blood–brain barrier]]. [[DMT1]] also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

Launched in 2008 with funding from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the '''Maternal Health Task Force''' (MHTF) is a global project focused on improving [[maternal health]] through better coordination, communication, and facilitation between existing maternal health organizations, as well as with experts in related fields. The Task Force serves as a catalyst to address one of the most neglected areas in global health.

Maternal morbidity and mortality rates remain unacceptably high across the [[developing world]]. Every minute, a woman dies from complications related to [[childbirth]] or [[pregnancy]]. While most maternal deaths are preventable, poor health services and scarce resources limit women’s access to life-saving, high-quality care. Although there have been some notable advances, efforts to adequately address maternal health remain fragmented, and the political will remains insufficient to effectively tackle the issues.

Recognizing that real progress requires better coordination and increased global attention, the Maternal Health Task Force brings together existing maternal health networks and engages new organizations to facilitate global coordination of maternal health programs. The Task Force does not duplicate or replace existing projects, but plays a complementary role by convening stakeholders and creating an inclusive setting to engage in dialogue, build consensus, and share information.

The Task Force provides a new forum dedicated specifically to maternal health, while reaching out to leaders from allied fields—including neonatal and child health, [[reproductive health]], human rights, and HIV/AIDS—to devise innovative solutions to maternal morbidity and mortality. As a key component of the initiative, partners in developing countries play a central role in setting the agenda. The Task Force works very closely with the [[Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health|Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health]] and other critical partners in this field.

The MHTF will engage organizations, individuals, and other partners that work at both theglobal and country level. It will also reach out to organizations and individuals in allied fields, such as family planning, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, newborn and child health, education, human rights and others in order to both contribute to their work and learn from their expertise. The MHTF will coordinate a set of activities identified as priorities for the maternal health field, promote collaboration among its constituents, and catalyze action around three thematic areas:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4378">A '''microlife''' is a unit of [[risk]] representing half an hour change of [[life expectancy]].&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;

Introduced by [[David Spiegelhalter]] and Alejandro Leiva, microlives are intended as a simple way of communicating the impact of a lifestyle or environmental risk factor, based on the associated daily proportional effect on expected length of life. Similar to the [[micromort]] (one in a million probability of death) the microlife is intended for "rough but fair comparisons between the sizes of chronic risks".&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;David Spiegelhalter, Using speed of ageing and "microlives" to communicate the effects of lifetime habits and environment, BMJ, 345, December 2012, doi 10.1136/bmj.e8223 [http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8223], as corrected by BMJ 2012;345:e8676 [http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8676]&lt;/ref&gt; This is to avoid the biasing effects of describing risks in relative hazard ratios, converting them into somewhat tangible units. Similarly they bring long-term future risks into the here-and-now as a gain or loss of time. 

:"A daily loss or gain of 30 minutes can be termed a microlife, because 1 000 000 half hours (57 years) roughly corresponds to a lifetime of adult exposure."&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;

The microlife exploits that for small hazard ratios the change in life expectancy is roughly linear.&lt;ref&gt;Haybittle JL. The use of the Gompertz function to relate changes in life expectancy to the standardized mortality ratio. Int J Epidemiol1998;27:885-9. [http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/5/885.short]&lt;/ref&gt; They are by necessity rough estimates, based on averages over population and lifetime. Effects of individual variability, short-term or changing habits, and causal factors are not taken into account.{{cite needed|date=May 2014}}

'''Perinatal mortality''' (PNM), also '''perinatal death''', refers to the death of a [[fetus]] or [[neonate]] and is the basis to calculate the '''perinatal [[mortality rate]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpc.unc.edu/measure/prh/rh_indicators/specific/nb/perinatal-mortality-rate-pmr|title=Perinatal mortality rate (PMR) — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.cpc.unc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in the precise definition of the perinatal mortality exist, specifically concerning the issue of inclusion or exclusion of early fetal and late neonatal fatalities. The [[WHO|World Health Organization]] defines perinatal mortality as the "number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life per 1,000 total births, the perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks (154 days) of gestation, and ends seven completed days after birth",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/maternal_perinatal/en/|title=WHO - Maternal and perinatal health|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other definitions have been used.&lt;ref name="pmid9431331"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardus JH, Graafmans WC, Verloove-Vanhorick SP, Mackenbach JP |title=The perinatal mortality rate as an indicator of quality of care in international comparisons |journal=[[Medical Care (journal)|Medical Care]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=54–66 |date=January 1998 |pmid=9431331 |doi= 10.1097/00005650-199801000-00007|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK figure is about 8 per 1,000 and varies markedly by social class with the highest rates seen in Asian women. Globally, an estimated 2.6 million neonates died in 2013 before the first month of age down from 4.5 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GBD204&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{Further information|Preterm birth#Specific risks for the preterm neonate}}
[[Preterm birth]] is the most common cause of perinatal mortality, causing almost 30 percent of neonatal deaths.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes&gt;[http://www.marchofdimes.org/loss/neonatal-death.aspx March of Dimes --&gt; Neonatal Death] Retrieved on November 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome]], in turn, is the leading cause of death in preterm infants, affecting about 1% of newborn infants.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez RJ, Martin RJ, and Fanaroff, AA. ''Respiratory distress syndrome and its management.'' Fanaroff and Martin (eds.) Neonatal-perinatal medicine: Diseases of the fetus and infant; 7th ed. (2002):1001-1011. St. Louis: Mosby.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth defect]]s cause about 21 percent of neonatal death.&lt;ref name=marchofdimes/&gt;

==Fetal mortality==
Fetal mortality refers to [[stillbirth]]s or fetal death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/fetal_death.htm|title=NVSS - Fetal Deaths|date=8 November 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses any death of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation or 500 gm. In some definitions of the PNM '''early fetal mortality''' (week 20-27 gestation) is not included, and the PNM may only include '''late fetal death''' and neonatal death. Fetal death can also be divided into death prior to [[Childbirth|labor]], '''antenatal (antepartum) death''', and death during labor, '''intranatal (intrapartum) death.'''

==Neonatal mortality==
'''Neonatal mortality''' refers to death of a live-born baby within the first 28 days of life. '''Early neonatal mortality''' refers to the death of a live-born [[baby]] within the first seven days of life, while '''late neonatal mortality''' refers to death after 7 days until before 28 days. Some definitions of the PNM include only the early neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality is affected by the quality of in-hospital care for the [[neonate]]. Neonatal mortality and postneonatal mortality (covering the remaining 11 months of the first year of life) are reflected in the '''[[Infant mortality|Infant Mortality Rate]]'''.

|}

The PNMR refers to the number of perinatal deaths per 1,000 total births. It is usually reported on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.checkpregnancy.com/miscarriage-statistics/|title=Miscarriage Risk by Week and What Affects Your Risks of Miscarriage|date=23 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major marker to assess the quality of health care delivery. Comparisons between different rates may be hampered by varying definitions, registration bias, and differences in the underlying risks of the populations.

PNMRs vary widely and may be below 10 for certain developed countries and more than 10 times higher in developing countries [http://www.cih.uib.no/journals/EJHD/ejhdv14-n3/ejhd-14-3-page-335.htm]. The WHO has not published contemporary data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31562">A '''phytoestrogen''' is a  plant-derived [[xenoestrogen]] (see [[estrogen]]) not generated within the [[endocrine system]], but consumed by eating phytoestrogenic plants. Also called a "dietary estrogen", it is a diverse group of naturally occurring  nonsteroidal plant compounds that, because of its structural similarity with [[estradiol]] (17-β-estradiol), have the ability to cause [[estrogenic]] and/or antiestrogenic effects.&lt;ref name= "Yil"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yildiz | first = Fatih | name-list-format = vanc | title = Phytoestrogens in Functional Foods| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd | year = 2005 |pages = 3–5, 210–211 | isbn  = 978-1-57444-508-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoestrogens are not essential [[nutrient]]s because their absence from the diet does not cause a disease, nor are they known to participate in any normal biological function.&lt;ref name= "Yil"/&gt;

Its name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''phyto'' ("plant") and ''estrogen'', the hormone which gives fertility to [[female mammals]]. The word "[[estrus]]" - Greek οίστρος - means "[[sexual desire]]", and "gene" - Greek γόνο - is "to generate".

[[File:Phytoestrogens2.png|thumb|Chemical structures of the most common phytoestrogens found in plants (top and middle) compared with estrogen (bottom) found in animals.|400px|right]]

== Structure ==

Phytoestrogens mainly belong to a large group of substituted [[natural phenol]]ic compounds: the [[coumestan]]s, [[prenylflavonoid]]s and [[isoflavone]]s are three of the most active in estrogenic effects in this class. The best-researched are isoflavones, which are commonly found in [[soy]] and [[red clover]]. [[Lignan]]s have also been identified as phytoestrogens, although they are not flavonoids.&lt;ref name= "Yil"/&gt; [[Mycoestrogens]] have similar structures and effects, but are not components of plants; these are mold metabolites of ''[[Fusarium]]'', especially common on cereal grains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennett GA, Shotwell OI | year = 1979 | title =  Zearalenone in cereal grains | journal = J.

== Mechanism of action ==

Phytoestrogens exert their effects primarily through binding to [[estrogen receptor]]s (ER).&lt;ref name="pmid17518366"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner JV, Agatonovic-Kustrin S, Glass BD | title = Molecular aspects of phytoestrogen selective binding at estrogen receptors | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 1879–85 | date = Aug 2007 | pmid = 17518366 | doi = 10.1002/jps.20987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two variants of the estrogen receptor, alpha ([[estrogen receptor alpha|ER-α]]) and beta ([[estrogen receptor beta|ER-β]]) and many phytoestrogens display somewhat higher [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand binding affinity|affinity]] for ER-β compared to ER-α.&lt;ref name="pmid17518366"/&gt;

The key structural elements that enable phytoestrogens to bind with high affinity to estrogen receptors and display estradiol-like effects are:&lt;ref name= "Yil"/&gt;
*The phenolic ring that is indispensable for binding to estrogen receptor
*The ring of isoflavones mimicking a ring of estrogens at the receptors binding site
*Low molecular weight similar to estrogens (MW=272)
*Distance between two hydroxyl groups at the isoflavones nucleus similar to that occurring in estradiol
*Optimal hydroxylation pattern

In addition to interaction with ERs, phytoestrogens may also modulate the concentration of endogenous estrogens by binding or inactivating some enzymes, and may affect the bioavailability of sex hormones by depressing or stimulating the synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).&lt;ref name= "Jon"/&gt;

Emerging evidence shows that some phytoestrogens bind to and transactivate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]s (PPARs).&lt;ref name="pmid15922618"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang ZC, Lowik C | title = Dose-dependent effects of phytoestrogens on bone | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 207–13 | date = Jul 2005 | pmid = 15922618 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2005.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19207876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang ZC | title = Dose-dependent effects of soy phyto-oestrogen genistein on adipocytes: mechanisms of action | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–9 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19207876 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2008.00554.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In vitro studies show an activation of PPARs at concentrations above 1 μM, which is higher than the activation level of ERs.&lt;ref name="pmid12421816"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang ZC, Audinot V, Papapoulos SE, Boutin JA, Löwik CW | title = Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma ) as a molecular target for the soy phytoestrogen genistein | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 2 | pages = 962–7 | date = Jan 2003 | pmid = 12421816 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M209483200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15068509"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dang Z, Löwik CW | title = The balance between concurrent activation of ERs and PPARs determines daidzein-induced osteogenesis and adipogenesis | journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 853–61 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15068509 | doi = 10.1359/jbmr.040120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the concentration below 1 μM, activation of ERs may play a dominant role. At higher concentrations (&gt;1 μM), both ERs and PPARs are activated. Studies have shown that both ERs and PPARs influence each other and therefore induce differential effects in a dose-dependent way. The final biological effects of genistein are determined by the balance among these pleiotrophic actions.&lt;ref name="pmid15922618"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19207876"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12421816"/&gt;

These compounds in plants are an important part of their defense system, mainly against fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Richard C. | last1 = Leegood | first2 = Per | last2 = Lea | name-list-format = vanc | title = Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-471-97683-7| page = 211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytoestrogens are ancient naturally occurring substances, and as dietary phytochemicals they are considered as co-evolutive with mammals. In the human diet, phytoestrogens are not the only source of exogenous estrogens. [[Xenoestrogens]] (novel, man-made), are found as [[food additive]]s&lt;ref name="pmid19063592"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amadasi A, Mozzarelli A, Meda C, Maggi A, Cozzini P | title = Identification of xenoestrogens in food additives by an integrated in silico and in vitro approach | journal = Chem.

== Food sources ==

According to one study of nine common phytoestrogens in a Western diet, foods with the highest relative phytoestrogen content were nuts and oilseeds, followed by soy products, cereals and breads, [[legume]]s, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. [[Flax]] seed and other oilseeds contained the highest total phytoestrogen content, followed by soybeans and [[tofu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson LU, Boucher BA, Liu Z, Cotterchio M, Kreiger N | title = Phytoestrogen content of foods consumed in Canada, including isoflavones, lignans, and coumestan | journal = Nutrition and Cancer | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 184–201 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16898863 | doi = 10.1207/s15327914nc5402_5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest concentrations of isoflavones are found in soybeans and soybean products followed by legumes, whereas lignans are the primary source of phytoestrogens found in nuts and oilseeds (e.g. flax) and also found in cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Phytoestrogen content varies in different foods, and may vary significantly within the same group of foods (e.g. soy beverages, tofu) depending on processing mechanisms and type of soybean used. Legumes (in particular soybeans), whole grain cereals, and some seeds are high in phytoestrogens.

== Effects on humans ==
&lt;!-- "Isoflavones" links here --&gt;
In human beings, phytoestrogens are readily absorbed into the circulatory system, circulate in plasma, and are excreted in the urine. Metabolic influence is different from that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus monogastric digestive systems.&lt;ref name= "Repro"/&gt;

A wide range of beneficial effects of phytoestrogens on the [[cardiovascular]], [[metabolic]], [[central nervous system|central nervous]] systems as well as reduction of risk of cancer and [[post menopausal]] symptoms have been claimed. However, there is also concern that phytoestrogens may act as [[endocrine disruptor]]s that adversely affect health. Based on currently available evidence, it is not clear whether the potential health benefits of phytoestrogens outweigh their risks.&lt;ref name="Rietjens_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rietjens IM, Louisse J, Beekmann K | title = The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 174 | issue = 11 | pages = 1263–1280 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 27723080 | pmc = 5429336 | doi = 10.1111/bph.13622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Males ===

It is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on male sexuality, with conflicting results about the potential effects of isoflavones originating from soy.

Some studies have found that some concentrations of isoflavones may have effects on intestinal cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19576">'''Positive deviance''' (PD) is an approach to behavioral and social change based on the observation that in any community there are people whose uncommon but successful behaviors or strategies enable them to find better solutions to a problem than their peers, despite facing similar challenges and having no extra resources or knowledge than their peers. These individuals are referred to as positive deviants.&lt;ref name="Tuhus-Dubrow, R 2009"&gt;Tuhus-Dubrow, R. The Power of Positive Deviants: A promising new tactic for changing communities from the inside. Boston Globe. November 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternin, J., &amp; Choo, R. (2000).

Protecting Children from Exploitation and Trafficking Using the Positive Deviance Approach in Uganda and Indonesia.  Save the Children Federation, Inc., 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept first appeared in nutrition research in the 1970s.  Researchers observed that despite the poverty in a community, some poor families had well nourished children. Some suggested using information gathered from these outliers to plan nutrition programs.&lt;ref&gt;Wishik SM, Van der Vynckt S. The use of nutritional "positive deviants" to identify approaches for modification of dietary practices.

Positive Deviance in Child Nutrition: with Emphasis on Psychosocial and Behavioral Aspects and Implications for Development. The United Nations University, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Positive deviance is a strength-based approach which is applied to problems requiring behavior and social change. It is based on the following principles:&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"&gt;Pascale, Sternin, &amp; Sternin. (2010) The Power of Positive Deviance: How Unlikely Innovators Solve the World's Toughest Problems. Harvard Business Press. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Communities already have the solutions. They are the best experts to solve their problems.
* Communities self-organize and have the human resources and social assets to solve an agreed-upon problem.
* Collective intelligence. Intelligence and know-how is not concentrated in the leadership of a community alone or in external experts but is distributed throughout the community. Thus the PD process's aim is to draw out the collective intelligence to apply it to a specific problem requiring behavior or social change.
* Sustainability as the cornerstone of the approach. The PD approach enables the community or organization to seek and discover sustainable solutions to a given problem because the demonstrably successful uncommon behaviors are already practiced in that community within the constraints and challenges of the current situation.
* It is easier to change behavior by practicing it rather than knowing about it. "It is easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than think your way into a new way of acting".

==Original application==
The PD approach was first operationalized and applied in programming in the field by Jerry and Monique Sternin through their work with [[Save the Children]] in [[Vietnam]] in the 1990s (Tuhus-Dubrow, Sternin, Sternin &amp; Pascale).&lt;ref name="Tuhus-Dubrow, R 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khatoon, Ajeeba, Ambreen, Amama, Shaifique, Mohammad, Sternin, Monique. The Positive Deviance Approach to Improve Household Practice for Better Newborn and Maternal Health Outcomes in Haripur, Pakistan. Operations Manual Saving Newborn Lives. July 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the pilot 64% of children weighed in the pilot villages were malnourished. Through a PD inquiry, the villagers found poor peers in the community that through their uncommon but successful strategies, had well-nourished children. These families collected foods typically considered inappropriate for children (sweet potato greens, shrimp, and crabs), washed their children's hands before meals, and actively fed them three to four times a day instead of the typical two meals a day provided to children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marsh DR, Pachon H, Schroeder DG, et al. Design of a prospective, randomized evaluation of an integrated nutrition program in rural Viet Nam. Food Nutr Bull. 2002;23(4):34-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mackintosh UAT, Marsh DR, Schroeder DG. Sustained positive deviant child care practices and their effects on child growth in Viet Nam. Food Nutr Bull. 2002;23(4):16-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without knowing it, PDs had incorporated foods already found in their community that provided important nutrients: [[protein]], [[iron]], and [[calcium]]. A nutrition program based on these insights was created. Instead of simply telling participants what to do differently, they designed the program to help them act their way into a new way of thinking. To attend a feeding session, parents were required to bring one of the newly identified foods. They brought their children and while sharing nutritious meals, learned to cook the new foods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the end of the two year pilot, malnutrition fell by 85%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Results were sustained, and transferred to the younger siblings of participants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

This approach to programming was different in important ways. Based on a community's own assets, the positive deviance approach operates within the specific cultural context of a given community (village, business, schools, ministry, department, hospital) and is therefore always appropriate. It provides to community members the "social proof" that an uncommon behavior can be adopted by all because it is already practiced by a few within the community. The solutions come from the community, therefore avoid the "immune response" that can occur when outside experts enter a community with best practices that are often unsuccessful in promoting sustained change. (Sternin)

Since it was first applied in [[Vietnam]], PD has been used to inform nutrition programs in over 40 countries by [[USAID]], [[World Vision]], [[Mercy Corps]], [[Save the Children]], [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], [[Plan International]], Indonesian Ministry of Health, [[Peace Corps]], [[Food for the Hungry]], among others.

==Steps==
A positive deviance approach may follow a series of steps.&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"/&gt;

===An invitation to change===
A PD inquiry begins with an invitation from a community that wishes to address an important problem they face. This is an important first step of community ownership of a process that they will lead.

===Defining the problem===
This process occurs with the community at the center of defining the problem for themselves. This will often lead to a problem definition that differs from the outside "expert" opinion of the situation. 
A quantitative baseline is established by the community. This baseline provides an opportunity for the community to reflect on the problem given the evidence at hand, and also measure the progress toward their goals.
This is also the beginning of the process to identify stakeholder and decision-makers regarding the issue at hand. Additional stakeholders and decision-makers will be pulled in throughout the process as they are identified.

===Determining the presence of PD individuals or groups===
Through the use of data and observation, the community establishes that there are Positive Deviants in their midst.

===Discovering uncommon practices or behaviors===
This is the Positive Deviance Inquiry. The community, having identified positive deviants, sets out to find the behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that allow the PD to be successful. The focus is on the successful strategies of the PD, not on making a hero of the person using the strategy. This self-discovery of people/groups just like them who have found successful solutions provide "social proof" that this problem can be overcome now, without outside resources.

===Program design===
Now that the community has identified successful strategies, they decide what strategies they would like to adopt, and design activities to help others access and practice these uncommon and other beneficial. Program design is not focused on spreading "best practices" but helping community members "act their way into a new way of thinking" through hands-on activities.

===Monitoring and evaluation===
PD-informed projects are monitored their programs and evaluated through a participatory process. As the monitoring will be decided on and performed by the community, the tools they create will be appropriate to the setting. This can allow even illiterate community members to participate through pictorial monitoring forms or other appropriate tools.
Evaluation allows the community to see the progress they are making towards their goals and reinforces the changes they are making in behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs.

===Scaling up===
The scaling up of a PD project may happen through many mechanisms: the "ripple effect" of other communities observing the success and engaging in a PD project of their own, through the coordination of NGOs, or organizational development consultants. However the project is scaled up, the process of community discovery of PDs in their midst remains vital to the acceptance of new behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge.

==Applications==

=== Preventing hospital-acquired infections ===
The PD approach has been applied in hospitals in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and England to stop the spread of hospital acquired infections such as [[c-diff]] and [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA). The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)  evaluated pilot programs in the U.S. and found units using the approach decreased their infections by 30-73%.&lt;ref&gt;Awad S., Palacio C., Subramanian A., et al. Implementation of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevention bundle results in decreased MRSA surgical site infections. The American Journal of Surgery. 2009; 198: 607-610.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it has been used in health care setting increase the incidence of hand washing, and improving care for patients immediately after a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;Bradly E, Curry L, Ramanadhan R, et al.  Research in action: using positive deviance to improve quality of health care. Implementation Science. May 2009: 4:25.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary care (Bright Spotting) ===
Termed "Bright Spotting",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thedo.osteopathic.org/2015/04/public-health-project-taps-into-superstar-patients-expertise/|title = Public health project taps into superstar patients' expertise - The DO|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of positive deviance, the primary care pilot initiative first took place in rural [[New Hampshire]] and is still ongoing.  The outpatient clinic identified a complex patient population, from the clinics perspective, studied the risk factors of that population, then identified measures that would signify that a patient has become healthy and sustained health.  Once these measures were identified, using both data and the practices knowledge of patient's, "Bright Spots" were identified as those that meet both criteria of high risk and achieved health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Finding patient experts: How to conduct positive deviance research|url = http://thedo.osteopathic.org/2015/04/finding-patient-experts-how-to-conduct-positive-deviance-research/|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding positive deviant patients through predictive analytics has also be suggested as a possible tool in discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Big Data With a Personal Touch: The Convergence of Predictive Analytics and Positive Deviance|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cole-zanetti-do/big-data-with-a-personal-_b_5206219.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once these patients were identified the care team performed qualitative research to discover their patterns of behavior.  The results were then shown to the bright spots and their families who then designed a peer learning experience with the results in mind.  The community meetings were then facilitated using both positive deviance facilitation techniques as well as applying the [http://www.cehd.umn.edu/fsos/projects/cpc/pdf/citizenhealth2006.pdf "Citizen Health Care Model"] which is very similar to positive deviance approaches.

PD projects to prevent the spread of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] took place in 2002 with motorbike taxi drivers in [[Vietnam]]&lt;ref&gt;Huogn, N, Sternin, S. Use of PD in HIV/AIDS Project in Sapa town, Viet Nam&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 with sex workers in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Sternin, J. Outcomes of the workshop on use of the PD approach for HIV/AIDS prevention and eradication among Warias (Transvestites) in Jakarta, Indonesia.&lt;/ref&gt; A PD project to enhance psychological resilience amongst adolescents vulnerable to depression and anxiety was implemented in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Center for Media &amp; Health, Gouda, the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child protection ===
A five-year PD project starting in 2003 to prevent girl trafficking in [[Indonesia]] with [[Save the Children]] and a local Indonesian NGO, helped them find viable economic options to stay in their communities.&lt;ref name="Singhal, Arvind 2010"/&gt;

A PD project to stop [[Female Genital Mutilation]]/Cutting in [[Egypt]] began in 1998 with CEDPA (Center for Development and Population Activities), COST (Coptic Organization for Services and Training), [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] in Minya, Community Development Agency (CDA), Monshaat Nasser in Beni Suef governorate, and the Center for Women's Legal Assistance (CEWLA). Efforts have already shown a reduction in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Masterson J, Swanson J. Female Genital Cutting: Breaking the Silence, Enabling Change. International Center for Research on Women (ICWR) and the Center for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA). Washington, DC. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Uganda]], a project with the Oak Foundation and [[Save the Children]] helped girls who were child soldiers with the [[Lords Resistance Army]] in [[Sudan]] reintegrate into their communities.&lt;ref name="Singhal, Arvind 2010"/&gt;

=== In education ===
PD projects in [[New Jersey]], [[California]], [[Argentina]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Burkina Faso]] have addressed drop out rates and keeping girls in school.

=== Private sector ===
Proponents of PD within management science argue that in any population, even in such seemingly mundane groups as service personnel in a [[fast food]] environment, the positive deviants have attitudes, cognitive processes and behavioral patterns that lead to significantly improved performance in key metrics such as speed-of-service and profitability. Studies claim that widespread adoption of the positive deviant approaches consistently leads to significant performance improvement.

PD had been significantly extended to the private sector, by William Seidman and Michael McCauley. Their extensions include methodologies and technologies for:
* Quickly identifying the positive deviants&lt;ref&gt;Harvesting the Experts '"Secret Sauce" To Close the Performance Gap., Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael. Performance Improvement Journal, Jan 2003 v42 n1 p32-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sustaining the change by others by integrating it into their pre-existing emotional and cognitive functions&lt;ref&gt;The Performance Improvement Multiplier, Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael. Performance Improvement. October 2003, v42, n9, pp.33-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scaling the positive deviant knowledge to large numbers of people simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;Performance Improvement in a Far-flung Enterprise. Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive deviance was further extended to groups or organizations by [[Gary Hamel]].&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Management, Hamel, Gary. Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamel looks to Positive Deviant companies to set the example for "management innovation."

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Priapism''' is a condition in which a [[penis]] remains [[erection|erect]] for hours in the absence of stimulation or after stimulation has ended.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; There are three types: [[ischemic]] (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic (intermittent).&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Most cases are ischemic.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism is generally painful while nonischemic priapism is not.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In ischemic priapism, most of the penis is hard; however, the [[glans penis]] is not.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In nonischemic priapism, the entire penis is only somewhat hard.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Very rarely, [[clitoral]] priapism occurs in women.&lt;ref name=Lehmiller2014&gt;{{cite book |authors=Justin J. Lehmiller|title=The Psychology of Human Sexuality|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=1119164702|year=2014|page=545|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytk5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism, and diagnosis --&gt;
[[Sickle cell disease]] is the most common cause of ischemic priapism.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Other causes include medications such as [[antipsychotic]]s, [[SSRIs]], and [[anticoagulants|blood thinners]], as well as drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[cannabis]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism occurs when blood does not adequately drain from the penis.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism is typically due to a connection forming between an [[artery]] and the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] or disruption of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] resulting in increased arterial flow.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism may occur following trauma to the penis or a [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Diagnosis may be supported by [[blood gas]] analysis of blood aspirated from the penis or [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, prognosis, and epidemiology--&gt;
Treatment depends on the type.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Ischemic priapism is typically treated with a [[nerve block]] of the penis followed by aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this is not sufficient, the corpus cavernosum may be irrigated with cold [[normal saline]] or injected with [[phenylephrine]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Nonischemic priapism is often treated with cold packs and compression.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Surgery may be done if usual measures are not effective.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; In ischemic priapism, the risk of permanent scarring of the penis begins to increase after four hours and definitely occurs after 48 hours.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salam|first1=Muhammad A.|title=Principles &amp; Practice of Urology: A Comprehensive Text|date=2003|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781581124118|page=342|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QPSWilXhECkC&amp;pg=PA342|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100327/https://books.google.ca/books?id=QPSWilXhECkC&amp;pg=PA342|archivedate=2017-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priapism occurs in about 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 males per year.&lt;ref name=EM2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podolej|first1=GS|last2=Babcock|first2=C|title=Emergency Department Management Of Priapism.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=January 2017|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–16|pmid=28027457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Priapism is classified into three groups: ischemic (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; The majority of cases (19 out of 20) are ischemic in nature.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

Some sources give a duration of four hours as a definition of priapism, but others give six: "The duration of a normal erection before it is classifiable as priapism is still controversial. Ongoing penile erections for more than 6 hours can be classified as priapism."&lt;ref name="scielo.br"&gt;PRIAPISM&amp;nbsp;– ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, C. VAN DER HORST, HENRIK STUEBINGER, CHRISTOPH SEIF, DIETHILD MELCHIOR, F.J. MARTÍNEZ-PORTILLO, K.P. JUENEMANN; {{cite web |url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429234259/http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ibju/v29n5/18554.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priapism in females (continued, painful erection of the [[clitoris]]) is significantly rarer than priapism in men, and is known as clitoral priapism or clitorism.&lt;ref name="Lehmiller2014" /&gt; It is associated with [[persistent genital arousal disorder]] (PGAD).&lt;ref name="Carcio"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Helen Carcio, MS, MEd, ANP-BC, R. Mimi Secor, MS, MEd, FNP-BC, NCMP, FAANP|title=Advanced Health Assessment of Women, Third Edition: Clinical Skills and Procedures|publisher=[[Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=0826123090|year=2014|page=85|accessdate=February 8, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4QbBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few case reports of women experiencing clitoral priapism exist.&lt;ref name="Lehmiller2014" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
===Complications===
Because [[ischemia|ischemic]] priapism causes the blood to remain in the penis for unusually long periods of time, the blood becomes deprived of oxygen and can cause damage to the penile tissue itself. Should the penile tissue become damaged, it can result in [[erectile dysfunction]] or disfigurement of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/priapism/basics/complications/con-20029378 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806005205/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/priapism/basics/complications/con-20029378 |archivedate=2014-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, if the penis develops severe vascular disease, the priapism can result in penile [[gangrene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Penile Gangrene: An Unusual Complication of Priapism in a Patient with Bladder Carcinoma| pmc=3192523 | pmid=22022653 | doi=10.4103/2006-8808.78470| volume=3| year=2011| journal=J Surg Tech Case Rep| pages=37–9| author=Ajape AA, Bello A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Priapism may be associated with [[hematology|haematological]] disorders, especially [[sickle-cell disease]], sickle-cell trait, and other conditions such as [[leukemia]], [[thalassemia]], and [[Fabry's disease]], and [[neurology|neurologic disorders]] such as [[spinal cord]] lesions and spinal cord trauma (priapism has been reported in people who have been hanged; see [[death erection]]).

Priapism may also be associated with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], which leads to decreased [[NADPH]] levels. NADPH is a co-factor involved in the formation of nitric oxide, which may result in priapism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Finley DS | title = Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency associated stuttering priapism: report of a case | journal = [[J Sex Med]] | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 2963–6 |date=December 2008 | pmid = 18823322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickle cell disease often presents special treatment obstacles. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also been used with success in some patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Macaluso JN | title = Priapism: Update for the non-urologist | journal = Sexual Medicine Today | volume = 9 | pages = 11–15 | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Priapism is also found to occur in extreme cases of [[rabies]]. Priapism also occurs due to encephalitic rabies.

===Medications===
Priapism can also be caused by reactions to [[medication]]s. The most common medications that cause priapism are intra-cavernous injections for treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]] ([[papaverine]], [[alprostadil]]). Other groups reported are [[antihypertensives]], [[antipsychotic]]s (e.g., [[chlorpromazine]], [[clozapine]]), [[antidepressant]]s (most notably [[trazodone]]), [[anti-convulsant]] and [[mood stabilizer]] drugs such as [[sodium valproate]],&lt;ref name="Bansal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bansal S, Gupta SK | title = Sodium Valproate induced priapism in an adult with bipolar affective disorder | journal = [[Indian Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 629 |date=November 2013 | doi = 10.4103/0253-7613.121383}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anticoagulants]], [[cantharides]] (''Spanish Fly'') and recreational drugs ([[alcohol]], [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]). Priapism is also known to occur from bites of the [[Brazilian wandering spider]] and the [[Latrodectus|black widow spider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20090924/spider-venom-for-erectile-dysfunction|title=Spider Venom for Erectile Dysfunction?|work=webmd.com|accessdate=11 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211214317/http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20090924/spider-venom-for-erectile-dysfunction|archivedate=11 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The mechanisms are poorly understood but involve complex neurological and [[vascular]] factors.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is often based on the history of the condition and the [[physical exam]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

[[Blood gas]] testing the blood from the cavernosa of the penis can help in the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If the low flow type of priapism is present the blood typically has a low pH while if the high flow type is present the pH is typically normal.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Color doppler [[ultrasound]] may also help differentiate the two.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Testing a person to make sure they do not have a [[hemoglobinopathy]] may also be reasonable.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

==Treatment==

Medical evaluation is recommended for erections that last for longer than four hours. Pain can often be reduced with a [[dorsal penile nerve]] block or penile [[ring block]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; For those with nonischemic priapism cold packs and pressure to the area may be sufficient.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Aspiration===
For those with ischemic priapism the initial treatment is typically [[Suction (medicine)|aspiration]] of blood from the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; This is done on either side.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this is not sufficiently effective then cold [[normal saline]] may be injected and removed.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Medications===
If aspiration is not sufficient a small dose of [[phenylephrine]] may be injected into the corpus cavernosum.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; Side effects of phenylephrine may include [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], and [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; If this medication is used, it is recommended that people be monitored for at least an hour after.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; For those with recurrent ischemic priapism [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) or [[terbutaline]] may be tried.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

===Surgery===
Distal shunts, such as the [[George D. Winter|Winter's]],{{clarify|date=November 2009}} involve puncturing the glans (the distal part of the penis) into one of the cavernosa, where the old, stagnant blood is held. This causes the blood to leave the penis and return to the circulation. This procedure can be performed by a urologist at the bedside. Winter's shunts are often the first invasive technique used, especially in hematologically induced priapism, as it is relatively simple and repeatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macaluso JN, Sullivan JW | title = Priapism: A review of 34 cases | journal = Urology | volume = 26 | pages = 233–236 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.1016/0090-4295(85)90116-5 | pmid = 4035837 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proximal shunts, such as the Quackel's,{{clarify|date=November 2009}} are more involved and entail operative dissection in the [[perineum]] to where the corpora meet the spongiosum, making an incision in both, and suturing both openings together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montague DK, Jarow J, Broderick GA, Dmochowski RR, Heaton JP, Lue TF, Nehra A, Sharlip ID | title = American Urological Association guideline on the management of priapism | journal = [[J. Urol.]] | volume = 170 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 1318–24 |date=October 2003 | pmid = 14501756 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000087608.07371.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shunts created between corpora cavernosa and saphenous vein called Grayhack shunt can be done though this technique is rarely used.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

As the complication rates with prolonged priapism are high, early [[penile prosthesis]] implantation may be considered.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; As well as allowing early resumption of sexual activity, early implantation can avoid the formation of dense fibrosis and hence a shortened penis.

===Sickle cell anemia===
In sickle-cell anemia treatment is initially with [[intravenous fluids]], [[pain medication]], and [[oxygen therapy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; The typical treatment of priapism may be carried out as well.&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt; [[Blood transfusions]] are not usually recommended as part of the initial treatment but if other treatments are not effective [[exchange transfusion]] may be done.&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite book|title=Evidence Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease|date=2014|publisher=NHLBI|pages=39–40|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-cell-disease-report.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125155233/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/sickle-cell-disease-report.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-25|df=|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EM2017/&gt;

==History==
Persistent semi-erections or intermittent states of prolonged erections have historically been sometimes called semi-priapism.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Herbert F., and Jane D. Northup. "Mechanism of human penile erection: an overview." Urology 17.5 (1981): 399-408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The name comes from the Greek god [[Priapus]] ({{lang-grc|Πρίαπος}}), a fertility god often represented with a disproportionately large and permanent erection.

The '''Prince Mahidol Award''' ({{lang-th|รางวัลสมเด็จเจ้าฟ้ามหิดล}}) is a [[Thailand|Thai]] [[Chakri Dynasty|Royal Family]] annual award for outstanding achievements in medicine and public health worldwide.

== Prince Mahidol Award Foundation ==
[[Rama IX|King Rama IX Bhumibol Adulyadej]] founded the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation on 1 January 1992 on the occasion of the 100th Anniversary of the birth of his father, [[Mahidol Adulyadej|Prince Mahidol]], initially under the name "Mahidol Award Foundation", but since 28 July 1997 as "Prince Mahidol Award Foundation." In addition to the actual award, the Fund also promotes the memory of Prince Mahidol, who is regarded as the father of modern medicine and public health of Thailand. [[Sirindhorn|Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]] is chairman of the Foundation Committee.

The award is given annually in two categories to international personalities or organizations:
* For outstanding progress in medicine
* For the active promotion of public health


and consists of:
* a medal
* a certificate
* prize money (US $100,000)

Between 1992 and 2014, 70 prizes were awarded, including 32 in medicine and 38 in public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princemahidolaward.org/laureates-year.en.php|title=List of winners|publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Foundation|accessdate=June 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014154444/http://www.princemahidolaward.org/laureates-year.en.php|archive-date=2014-10-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nomination process ===
# Any individual or group of individuals may be nominated by a national governmental agency, or by an individual. Nominations are transmitted to the secretary-general of the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation.
# The nomination forms are forwarded to the Scientific Advisory Committee for initial screening.
# Once screened, the International Award Committee, which comprises several world-renowned experts in the fields of medicine and public health, will consider them and make recommendations to the Foundation’s Board of Trustees.
# The Foundation’s Board of Trustees makes final approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination Procedures|url=http://www.princemahidolaward.org/nomination-procedures.en.php|accessdate=June 9, 2014|publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014111319/http://www.princemahidolaward.org/nomination-procedures.en.php|archive-date=2014-10-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Recurrent Genital Herpes Quality of Life''' (RGHQoL) measure is a [[patient-reported outcome]] measure which determines the impact that recurrent genital herpes has on a patient’s quality of life. It is a 20 item [[questionnaire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doward|first=LC|author2=McKenna, SP |author3=Kohlmann, T |author4=Niero, M |author5=Patrick, D |author6=Spencer, B |author7= Thorsen, H |title=The international development of the RGHQoL: a quality of life measure for recurrent genital herpes.|journal=Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation|date=February 1998|volume=7|issue=2|pages=143–53|pmid=9523496|doi=10.1023/A:1008857426633}}&lt;/ref&gt; with items such as “Herpes makes it difficult for me to plan ahead” and “I worry that sex will trigger an outbreak.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RGHQoL|url=http://www.galen-research.com/content/measures/RGHQoL%20UK%20-%20First%20page%20sample.pdf|work=Galen-Research.com|publisher=Galen Research|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower scores on the RGHQoL indicate a higher negative impact on quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=R|author2=Boselli, F |author3=Cairo, I |author4=Barnett, G |author5=Price, M |author6= Wulf, HC |title=Patients' perspectives on the burden of recurrent genital herpes.|journal=International journal of STD &amp; AIDS|date=October 2001|volume=12|issue=10|pages=640–5|pmid=11564330|doi=10.1258/0956462011923859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The RGHQoL was published in 1998 by Galen Research and was funded by [[Glaxo Wellcome]] Research &amp; Development. The content of the measure was taken from qualitative interviews conducted with patients with recurrent genital herpes. The initial interviews were conducted in the UK and then an international panel was assembled in order to translate and validate the measure for the UK, USA, Italy, France, Germany and Denmark. Items were translated and then field tested with up to 20 RGH patients in each country. The test-retest correlations for each language version was found to be in excess of 0.85, meaning every version had good reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doward|first=LC|author2=McKenna, SP |author3=Kohlmann, T |author4=Niero, M |author5=Patrick, D |author6=Spencer, B |author7= Thorsen, H |title=The international development of the RGHQoL: a quality of life measure for recurrent genital herpes.|journal=Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation|date=February 1998|volume=7|issue=2|pages=143–53|pmid=9523496|doi=10.1023/A:1008857426633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International use ==

The RGHQoL has been used in numerous clinical studies worldwide as a tool for assessing new treatments and measuring quality of life. It has been utilized in studies investigating suppressive [[antiviral therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=R|author2=Tyring, S |author3=Strand, A |author4=Price, MJ |author5= Grant, DM |title=Impact of suppressive antiviral therapy on the health related quality of life of patients with recurrent genital herpes infection.|journal=Sexually transmitted infections|date=December 1999|volume=75|issue=6|pages=398–402|pmid=10754944|doi=10.1136/sti.75.6.398|pmc=1758256}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[famciclovir]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bartlett BL, Tyring SK, Fife K, Gnann JW, Hadala JT, Kianifard F, Berber E|title=Famciclovir treatment options for patients with frequent outbreaks of recurrent genital herpes: the RELIEF trial.|journal=Journal of Clinical Virology|date=October 2008|volume=43|issue=2|pages=190–5|pmid=18621575|doi=10.1016/j.jcv.2008.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quality of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=R|author2=Boselli, F |author3=Cairo, I |author4=Barnett, G |author5=Price, M |author6= Wulf, HC |title=Patients' perspectives on the burden of recurrent genital herpes.|journal=International journal of STD &amp; AIDS|date=October 2001|volume=12|issue=10|pages=640–5|pmid=11564330|doi=10.1258/0956462011923859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rome Consensus for a Humanitarian Drug Policy''' is a framework for dialogue and cooperation that commits 114 National Societies of [[Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent]] from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the [[Americas]] and [[Europe]] to promote and implement humanitarian approaches to [[drug policy]]. The Rome Consensus aims at raising the profile of drug policy to the forefront of social concerns, hinging formulation and implementation of drug control on [[public health]] concerns. 

The foundation text of the Rome Consensus reinforces the Red Cross - Red Crescent movement’s engagement in drug policy. In a nutshell, within the Rome Consensus Declaration National Societies: 
* Recognize the need for a new humanitarian, realistic, public health and socially based drug policy; 
* Establish a new commitment to a humanitarian drug policy based on reason and compassion that generates action, free from [[ideology]], force, [[stigmatization]] and [[discrimination]];
* Commit the strength of the Red Cross - Red Crescent Movement provided by its auxiliary role to national governments on [[humanitarian assistance]], to actively encourage the formulation and implementation of a humanitarian drug policy that saves lives and alleviates human suffering.

[[The Global Media Centre]] handles their media outreach.

==Chairs of the Rome Consensus==
[[The International Council on Security and Development (ICOS)]] co-chairs the Rome Consensus for a Humanitarian Drug Policy together with the [[Italian Red Cross]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32415">Although it is toxic in large doses, '''[[selenium]]''' is an essential [[micronutrient]] for animals. In plants, it sometimes occurs in toxic amounts as [[forage]], e.g. [[locoweed]]. Selenium is a component of the [[amino acid]]s [[selenocysteine]] and [[selenomethionine]]. In humans, selenium is a [[dietary mineral|trace element]] nutrient that functions as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for [[glutathione peroxidase]]s and certain forms of [[thioredoxin reductase]].&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Lippard, J. M. Berg "Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry" University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA; 1994.  {{ISBN|0-935702-73-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium-containing proteins are produced from inorganic selenium via the intermediacy of [[Selenophosphate synthetase 1|selenophosphate]] (PSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Se-containing biomolecules==

Selenium is an essential [[micronutrient]] in mammals, but is also recognized as toxic in excess. Selenium exerts its biological functions through [[selenoprotein]]s, which contain the [[amino acid]] [[selenocysteine]]. Twenty-five selenoproteins are encoded in the [[human genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Glutathione peroxidase===
The [[glutathione peroxidase]] family of enzymes (abbreviated GSH-Px) catalyze reduction of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and organic [[hydroperoxide]]s:

:2H + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   GSSG  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The two H atoms are donated by thiols in a process that begins with oxidation of a [[selenol]] side chain in GSH-Px.  The [[organoselenium compound]] [[ebselen]] is a drug used to supplement the action of GSH-Px.  It functions as a catalyst for the destruction of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bhabak Krishna P., Mugesh Govindasamy | year = 2010 | title = Functional Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase: Bioinspired Synthetic Antioxidants | url = | journal = Acc. Chem. Res. | volume = 43 | issue = 11| pages = 1408–1419 | doi = 10.1021/ar100059g | pmid = 20690615 | last2 = Mugesh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related selenium-containing enzyme in some plants and in animals ([[thioredoxin reductase]]) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme [[ribonucleotide reductase]] that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.&lt;ref name="Stadtman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stadtman TC |title=Selenocysteine |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=65 |issue= |pages=83–100 |year=1996 |pmid=8811175 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.65.070196.000503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deiodinases===
Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the [[thyroid]] gland.  It participates as a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for the three [[thyroid hormone]] [[deiodinase]]s.  These enzymes activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/selenium/ |publisher = Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University |title = Selenium |accessdate = 2009-01-05|date = 2014-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may inhibit [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis|Hashimotos's disease]], an auto-immune disease in which the body's own thyroid cells are attacked by the immune system. A reduction of 21% on TPO antibodies was reported with the dietary intake of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg of selenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17696828 |title = Effects of 12 months treatment with L-selenomethionine on serum anti-TPO Levels in Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis |year=2007 |last1=Mazokopakis |first1=EE |last2=Papadakis |first2=JA |last3=Papadomanolaki |first3=MG |last4=Batistakis |first4=AG |last5=Giannakopoulos |first5=TG |last6=Protopapadakis |first6=EE |last7=Ganotakis |first7=ES |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=609–12 |doi=10.1089/thy.2007.0040 |journal=Thyroid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formate dehydrogenase===
Some microorganisms ulitize selenium in [[formate dehydrogenase]]. Formate is produced in large amounts in the hepatic (liver cells) mitochondria of embryonic cells and in cancer cells by the folate cycle.&lt;ref&gt;H Frederik Nijhout, et al, In silico experimentation with a model of hepatic mitochondrial folate metabolism, Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, 2006, 3:40, link http://www.tbiomed.com/content/3/1/40/abstract).&lt;/ref&gt;

Formate is reversibly oxidized by the enzyme [[formate dehydrogenase]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reda T., Plugge C. M., Abram N. J., Hirst J. | year = 2008 | title = Reversible interconversion of carbon dioxide and formate by an electroactive enzyme | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 105 | issue = 31| pages = 10654–10658 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0801290105 | pmid = 18667702 | last2 = Plugge | last3 = Abram | last4 = Hirst | pmc = 2491486 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..10510654R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  →   CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Thioredoxin reductase ===
[[Thioredoxin reductase]] uses a cysteine-selenocysteine pair to reduce the [[disulphide]] in [[thioredoxin]]. The selenocysteine  is arranged in an unusual Sec-His-Glu [[catalytic triad]], which tunes its pKa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|pmid=15651042|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicator plants==
Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil, since they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are ''[[Astragalus]]'' species (including some [[locoweed]]s), prince's plume (''[[Stanleya (plant)|Stanleya]]'' sp.), woody asters (''[[Xylorhiza]]'' sp.), and false goldenweed (''[[Oonopsis]]'' sp.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/54282000/PPClassPPSlides/3-27-08DavisSelenium.pdf |title = Selenium in Plants |accessdate = 2008-12-05 |author= Zane Davis, T. |year = 2008 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use of synthetic selenium compounds==
The substance loosely called [[selenium disulfide|selenium sulfide]] (with the approximate formula SeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the active ingredient in some anti-dandruff shampoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://pharmacycode.com/Selenium(IV)_sulfide.html |title =Selenium(IV)_sulfide |publisher = Pharmacy Codes |accessdate = 2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selenium compound kills the scalp fungus ''[[Malassezia]]'', which causes shedding of dry skin fragments. The ingredient is also used in body lotions to treat [[Tinea versicolor]] due to infection by a different species of ''Malassezia'' fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/selenium.html |title = Selenium sulfide |publisher = DermNet NZ |accessdate = 2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection in biological fluids==
Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in a forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior to being eliminated in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1416–1420.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
Although selenium is an essential [[dietary mineral|trace element]], it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the [[Dietary Reference Intake|Tolerable Upper Intake Level]] of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h7 |title = Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Selenium |publisher = National Institutes of Health; Office of Dietary Supplements |accessdate = 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 400 microgram ([[Microgram|µg]]) Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids |publisher = Institute of Medicine |date = August 15, 2000 |pages = 314–315 |url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9810&amp;page=315 |isbn = 978-0-309-06949-6 |author = a report of the Panel on Dietary Antioxidants and Related Compounds, Subcommittees on Upper Reference Leves of Nutrients and of Interpretation and Use of Dietary Reference Intakes, and the Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to not only avoid [[toxicity]], but also to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to account for data from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;

Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can result in [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[pulmonary edema]], and death.&lt;ref name="tp92-c3"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp92-c3.pdf |format = PDF |publisher = Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |title = Public Health Statement: Health Effects |accessdate = 2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elemental selenium and most metallic [[selenide]]s have relatively low toxicities because of their low [[bioavailability]]. By contrast, [[selenate]]s and [[Selenite (ion)|selenites]] are very toxic, having an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Wilber |first = C. G. |title = Toxicology of selenium |year = 1980 |journal = Clinical Toxicology |volume = 17 |pages = 171–230 |doi = 10.3109/15563658008985076 |pmid = 6998645|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrogen selenide]] is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.3109/10915818609140736 |title = Selenium Toxicity in Animals with Emphasis on Man |year = 1986 |author = Olson, O.E. |journal = International Journal of Toxicology |volume = 5 |page = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, [[selenomethionine]], [[selenocysteine]] and [[methylselenocysteine]], all of which have high [[bioavailability]] and are toxic in large doses.

[[Selenium Pollution|Selenium poisoning]] of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new "wetlands" as the water evaporates. High selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qN0I3husm50C&amp;pg=PA477 |chapter = Ecotoxicology of selenium |title = Handbook of ecotoxicology |first = H.

[[File:Se dose-response curve for juvenile salmon mortality - percent scale.jpg|thumb|Relationship between survival of juvenile salmon and concentration of selenium in their tissues after 90 days (Chinook salmon: Hamilton et al. 1990) or 45 days (Atlantic salmon: Poston et al. 1976) exposure to dietary selenium. The 10% lethality level (LC10=1.84 µg/g) was derived by applying the biphasic model of Brain and Cousens (1989) to only the Chinook salmon data. The Chinook salmon data comprise two series of dietary treatments, combined here because the effects on survival are indistinguishable.]]

In fish and other wildlife, low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity.  For example, in salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium in the fish tissue (whole body) is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of tissue (dry weight).  At levels much below that concentration, young salmon die from selenium deficiency;&lt;ref name= Poston. &gt;{{cite journal | last= Poston | first= H. A. |author2= Combs, G.

==Deficiency==
{{main article|Selenium deficiency}}
Selenium deficiency can occur in patients with severely compromised [[intestine|intestinal]] function, those undergoing [[total parenteral nutrition]], and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/71/2/590 |title = Effect of micronutrient status on natural killer cell immune function in healthy free-living subjects aged &gt;=90 y1 |author = Ravaglia et al. |volume = 71 |issue = 2 |pages = 590–598 |journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |pmid = 10648276 |date=1 February 2000 |last2 = Forti |first2 = P |last3 = Maioli |first3 = F |last4 = Bastagli |first4 = L |last5 = Facchini |first5 = A |last6 = Mariani |first6 = E |last7 = Savarino |first7 = L |last8 = Sassi |first8 = S |last9 = Cucinotta |first9 = D|last10 = Lenaz |first10 = G |display-authors = 8 |doi = 10.1093/ajcn/71.2.590 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although [[New Zealand]] has low levels of selenium in its soil, adverse health effects have not been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/Sel.htm |work = Prescriber Update Articles |title = Selenium |accessdate = 2009-07-13 |publisher = New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority |author = MedSafe Editorial Team }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selenium deficiency as defined by low (&lt;60% of normal) selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues only occurs when a low selenium status is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ralston|first=N.V.C.|author2=Raymond, L.J. |title=Dietary selenium's protective effects against methylmercury toxicity|journal=Toxicology|year=2010|volume=278|issue=1|pages=112–123|doi=10.1016/j.tox.2010.06.004|pmid=20561558}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a result of increased oxidant stress due to vitamin E deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Essentials of Human Nutrition |edition = 2nd |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-19-262756-8 |first1 = Jim |last1 = Mann |first2 = A. Stewart |last2 = Truswell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selenium interacts other nutrients, such as [[iodide]] and [[vitamin E]]. The interaction is observed in the [[etiology]] of many deficiency diseases in animals and pure selenium deficiency is rare. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly in relation to [[Kashin-Beck disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/78/1/137?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=selenium&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT |title = Selenium and iodine supplementation of rural Tibetan children affected by Kashin-Beck osteoarthropathy |first1 = Rodrigo |last1 =Moreno-Reyes |first2 = Jean |last2 =Mathieu| first3 = Marleen |last3 =Vanderpas| first4 = Françoise |last4 = Begaux| first5 = Carl |last5 =Suetens| first6 = Maria T. |last6 =Rivera| first7 = Jean |last7 =Nève| first8 = Noémi |last8 =Perlmutter |journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume = 78 |issue = 1 |pages = 137–144 |year = 2003 |author9=V |pmid=12816783 |doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.1.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for selenium in 2000. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for selenium for people ages 14 and up is 45 μg/day. The RDA is 55 μg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 60 μg/day. RDA for lactation is 70 μg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 20 to 40 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of selenium the UL is 400 μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref name="DRItext"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids | chapter = Selenium | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2000 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 284–324 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/9810/chapter/9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at 70 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 70 μg/day, for lactation 85 μg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 15 to 55 μg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 300 μg/day, which is lower than the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For selenium labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 70 μg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 55 μg.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. Food and supplement companies have until January 1, 2020 to comply with the change.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates "Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel - Compliance Date"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, selenium deficiency is not common. A federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 89 and 125 μg/day, respectively. For women and men of all ages fewer than 3% consumed less than the EAR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/0102/usualintaketables2001-02.pdf/ What We Eat In America, NHANES 2001–2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106010550/https://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/0102/usualintaketables2001-02.pdf |date=2015-01-06 }}. Table A15: Selenium.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food sources==
Dietary selenium comes from nuts, [[cereals]], [[meat]], [[mushrooms]], [[fish]], and [[egg (food)|egg]]s. [[Brazil nut]]s are the richest ordinary dietary source and could cause selenium toxicity if consumed regularly – though the actual concentration of selenium (as with any plant-based food sources, such as another selenium-accumulating "paradise nut" [[Lecythis]], belonging to the same family [[Lecythidaceae]]) is soil-dependent and may vary significantly by geographic location. In descending order of concentration, high levels are also found in [[kidney]], [[tuna]], [[crab]], and [[lobster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Barclay |first = Margaret N. I. |author2=Allan MacPherson |author3=James Dixon  |year = 1995 |title=Selenium content of a range of UK food |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages = 307–318 |doi = 10.1006/jfca.1995.1025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A list of selenium-rich foods can be found on [http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/selenium.asp#h2 The Office of Dietary Supplements Selenium Fact Sheet].{{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human body's content of selenium is believed to be in the 13–20 milligram range.&lt;ref&gt;The most popular web reference for this is [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=6424964].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human health==

===Cancer===
"Although an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer was found in some observational studies, this cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation, and these results should be interpreted with caution... Conflicting results including inverse, null and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types... RCTs assessing the effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results... To date, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vinceti|first=Marco|last2=Filippini|first2=Tommaso|last3=Del Giovane|first3=Cinzia|last4=Dennert|first4=Gabriele|last5=Zwahlen|first5=Marcel|last6=Brinkman|first6=Maree|last7=Zeegers|first7=Maurice Pa|last8=Horneber|first8=Markus|last9=D'Amico|first9=Roberto|date=January 29, 2018|title=Selenium for preventing cancer|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|pages=CD005195|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005195.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=29376219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
AIDS appears to involve a slow and progressive decline in levels of selenium in the body. Whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of HIV or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by AIDS patients remains debated. Observational studies have found an association between decreased selenium levels and poorer outcomes in patients with HIV, though these studies were mostly done prior to the currently effective treatments with highly active antiretroviral therapy ([[HAART]]).  Currently there is inadequate evidence to recommend routine selenium supplementation for HIV patients, and further research is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stone CA, Kawai K, Kupka R, Fawzi WW |title=Role of selenium in HIV infection |journal=Nutr.

===Mortality===
Selenium supplementation has no effect on overall mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid =22419320|year =2012|last1 =Bjelakovic|first1 =G|last2 =Nikolova|first2 =D|last3 =Gluud|first3 =LL|last4 =Simonetti|first4 =RG|last5 =Gluud|first5 =C|title =Antioxidant supplements for prevention of mortality in healthy participants and patients with various diseases|volume =3|issue =3|pages =CD007176|doi =10.1002/14651858.CD007176.pub2|journal =Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|editor1-last =Bjelakovic|editor1-first =Goran|url =http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-31802015000200164|type =Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuberculosis===
As with other types of supplementation, there is no good evidence selenium supplementation helps in the treatment of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grobler L, Nagpal S, Sudarsanam TD, Sinclair D |title=Nutritional supplements for people being treated for active tuberculosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=6 |pages=CD006086 |year=2016 |pmid=27355911 |pmc=4981643 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006086.pub4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diabetes===

A meta-analysis of four RCTs concluded that there is no support for selenium supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Caucasians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mao S, Zhang A, Huang S |title=Selenium supplementation and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Endocrine |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=758–63 |year=2014 |pmid=24858736 |doi=10.1007/s12020-014-0298-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human reproductive system===
Abnormally high or low levels of dietary selenium can have an adverse effect on sperm quality, with a consequent lowering of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ahsan U, Kamran Z, Raza I, etal |title=Role of selenium in male reproduction - a review |journal=[[Anim.

==Evolution in biology and biosynthetic considerations==

Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine,&lt;ref name="glady"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gladyshev VN, Hatfield DL |title=Selenocysteine-containing proteins in mammals |journal=Journal of Biomedical Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=151–60 |year=1999 |pmid=10343164 |doi=10.1007/BF02255899|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biochemgladyshev/77 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in utilization of the small reducing molecules [[glutathione]] and [[thioredoxin]].

Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, [[vanadium]], [[magnesium]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]], may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas.&lt;ref name="glady" /&gt; Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their seleno-proteomes, whereas the seleno-proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Zhang Y, Sengupta A, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN |title=Evolutionary dynamics of eukaryotic selenoproteomes: large selenoproteomes may associate with aquatic life and small with terrestrial life |journal=Genome Biology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=R198 |year=2007 |pmid=17880704 |pmc=2375036 |doi=10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The selenium content of SEPP1 versus selenium requirements in vertebrates|url = https://peerj.com/articles/1244|journal = PeerJ|pmc = 4699779|pmid = 26734501|volume = 3|pages = e1244|doi = 10.7717/peerj.1244|first = Sam|last = Penglase|first2 = Kristin|last2 = Hamre|first3 = Ståle|last3 = Ellingsen|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 Mya, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of "new" endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C), [[polyphenol]]s (including flavonoids), [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late [[Jurassic]] period.

About 200 Mya, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Castellano S, Novoselov SV, Kryukov GV, etal |title=Reconsidering the evolution of eukaryotic selenoproteins: a novel nonmammalian family with scattered phylogenetic distribution |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–7 |year=2004 |pmid=14710190 |pmc=1298953 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kryukov GV, Gladyshev VN |title=The prokaryotic selenoproteome |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=538–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15105824 |pmc=1299047 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400126}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilting R, Schorling S, Persson BC, Böck A |title=Selenoprotein synthesis in archaea: identification of an mRNA element of Methanococcus jannaschii probably directing selenocysteine insertion |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=266 |issue=4 |pages=637–41 |year=1997 |pmid=9102456 |doi=10.1006/jmbi.1996.0812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Y, Fomenko DE, Gladyshev VN |title=The microbial selenoproteome of the Sargasso Sea |journal=Genome Biology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=R37 |year=2005 |pmid=15833124 |pmc=1088965 |doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-4-r37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A group of Damas de Rojo.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Chile]]an 'Damas de Rojo', volunteers on their local hospital and a clear example of social medicine.]]
The field of '''social medicine''' seeks to implement social care through:
# understand how social and economic conditions impact health, disease and the practice of medicine and
# foster conditions in which this understanding can lead to a healthier society.

Social medicine as a scientific field gradually began in the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent increase in poverty and disease among workers raised concerns about the effect of social processes on the health of the poor. The field of social medicine is most commonly addressed today by [[public health]] efforts to understand what are known as [[social determinants of health]].

==Scope==
The major emphasis on biomedical science in medical education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hixon|first=Allen L.|last2=Yamada|first2=Seiji|last3=Farmer|first3=Paul E.|last4=Maskarinec|first4=Gregory G.|date=2013-01-16|title=Social justice: The heart of medical education|url=http://socialmedicine.info/index.php/socialmedicine/article/view/671|journal=Social Medicine|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=161–168|issn=1557-7112}}&lt;/ref&gt; health care, and medical research has resulted into a gap with our understanding and acknowledgement of far more important social determinants of public health and individual disease: social-economic inequalities, war, illiteracy, detrimental life-styles (smoking, obesity), discrimination because of race, gender and religion. Farmer et al. (2006) gave the following explanation for this gap:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The holy grail of modern medicine remains the search for a molecular basis of disease. While the practical yield of such circumscribed inquiry has been enormous, exclusive focus on molecular-level phenomena has contributed to the increasing "desocialization" of scientific inquiry: a tendency to ask only biological questions about what are in fact biosocial phenomena.'''

They further concluded that ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Biosocial understandings of medical phenomena are urgently needed'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer, Paul, Bruce Nizeye, Sarah Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee|first=|year=2006|title=Structural violence and clinical medicine|pmc=1621099|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=v.3(10): e449|page=e449|via=|pmid=17076568|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social care==
Social care traditionally takes a different look at issues of impairment and disability by adopting a holistic perspective on health. The social model was developed as a direct response to the medical model, the social model sees barriers (physical, attitudinal and behavioural) not just as a biomedical issue, but as caused in part by the society we live in – as a product of the physical, organizational and social worlds that lead to discrimination (Oliver 1996; French 1993; Oliver and Barnes 1993). Social care advocates equality of opportunities for vulnerable sections of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kieran Walshe|author2=Judith Smith|title=Healthcare Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TRFBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261|date=1 September 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=978-0-335-24382-2|pages=261+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
German physician [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821–1902) laid foundations for this model.

'''Spermatorrhea''' is a condition of excessive, involuntary [[ejaculation]]. It is a recognized disorder in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], in which certain patterns of involuntary ejaculation reflect problems with [[Kidney (Chinese medicine)|kidney]] [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acuxo.com/library.asp?firstResponse=Spermatorrhea&amp;condition=Seminal%20Emission]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findhealer.com/library/article19.php3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612164614/http://www.findhealer.com/library/article19.php3 |date=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries, if a patient had [[ejaculation]]s outside of marital intercourse, or released more semen than is typical, then he was diagnosed with a disease called ''spermatorrhea'' or "seminal weakness".Indian Ayurveda has a cure for this disease which can be Developed with the help of cannabis infused medicines.

According to modern Western medicine, ejaculation is a normal process, and some even see it as a normal part of daily life, and incapable of causing ill effects, other than temporary tiredness and reduction of sexual desire in the individual concerned. In contrast, Traditional Chinese Medicine counts the production of [[semen]] as one of the biggest strains on [[Jing (TCM)|jing]] (kidney essence).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6643">'''Systems medicine''' is an interdisciplinary field of study that looks at the systems of the human body as part of an integrated whole, incorporating biochemical, physiological, and environment interactions. Systems medicine draws on [[systems science]] and [[systems biology]], and considers complex interactions within the human body in light of a patient's [[genomics]], behavior and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Federoff |first1= Howard| last2= Gostin|first2= Lawrence O.| url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184479 |title=Evolving from Reductionism to Holism: Is There a Future for Systems Medicine?| journal= Journal of the American Medical Association|volume= 302|issue=9 |year=2009| pages=994–996 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1264 | pmid=19724047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest uses of the term ''systems medicine'' appeared in 1992, in an article on systems medicine and pharmacology by B.J. Zeng &lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the holographic model of human body, 1st National Conference of Comparative Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April, 1992 ( termed "systems medicine and pharmacology").&lt;/ref&gt; and in a paper on systems biomedicine by T. Kamada.&lt;ref&gt;Kamada T. ,System biomedicine: a new paradigm in biomedical engineering. Front Med Biol Eng. 1992;4(1):1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important topic in systems medicine and [[systems biomedicine]] is the development of computational models that  describe disease progression and the effect of therapeutic interventions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16485">'''Teledermatology''' is a subspecialty in the medical field of [[dermatology]] and probably one of the most common applications of [[telemedicine]] and [[e-health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ATA Teledermatology SIG | url = http://www.atmeda.org/icot/sigtelederm.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070202162157/http://www.atmeda.org/icot/sigtelederm.htm | archive-date = 2 February 2007 | dead-url = yes | publisher = American Telemedicine Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; In teledermatology, telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information (concerning [[skin]] conditions and [[tumours]] of the skin) over a distance using audio, visual and data communication. Applications comprise health care management such as diagnoses, consultation and treatment as well as (continuous) education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wootton R | veditors = Wootton R, Craig J, Patterson V | chapter = Realtime Telemedicine |title=Introduction to Telemedicine | publisher = CRC Press | date = December 2017 |isbn=978-1-351-98946-6 |edition=Second | page = 88 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hApEDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wurm_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wurm EM, Hofmann-Wellenhof R, Wurm R, Soyer HP | year = 2007 | title = Telemedizin und Teledermatologie: Vergangenheit Gegenwart und Zukunft | url = | journal = JDDG | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 106–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Burg_2005"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Burg G, Soyer HP, Chimenti S | date = 2005 | chapter = Teledermatology | veditors = Frisch P, Burgdorf W | title = EDF White Book, Skin Diseases in Europe | location = Berlin | pages = 130–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dermatologists Perednia and Brown were the first to coin the term "teledermatology" in 1995. In a scientific publication, they described the value of a teledermatologic service in a rural area underserved by dermatologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perednia DA, Brown NA | year = 1995 | title = Teledermatology: one application of telemedicine | url = | journal = Bull Med Libr Assoc | volume = 83 | issue = 1| pages = 42–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of data transmission==
Teledermatology (as telemedicine) is practised on the basis of two concepts: '''[[Store and forward]] (SAF)''' and '''real time/live interactive teledermatology'''. Hybrid modes also exist (combining SAF and real time applications).

The SAF method is most commonly used in teledermatology: It involves sending (forwarding) digital images associated with (anonymous) medical information to the data storage unit of a consulted specialist. It can be as easy as sending an email with a digital image of a lesion to seek advice for a skin condition. Advantages of this method are that it does not demand the presence of both parties at the same time and does not usually require expensive equipment.

In real-time/ live interactive teledermatology applications, provider and individuals usually interact via live [[videoconferencing]]. It may also involve [[remote surgery]] and the use of telerobotic microscopes in dermatopathology. This mode generally requires more sophisticated and costly technology than used in the SAF mode. Both participants must be available at the same time.

==Areas of application==

===Health care management===
'''Direct consultation''' involves an individual with a skin condition contacting a dermatologist via [[telecommunication]] to request diagnosis and treatment. In this field, mobile applications of teledermatology gain importance.

[[Telediagnosis]] in the absence of personal contact with health care workers to the individual is complex. It requires active participation of the individual and without appropriate guidance may lead to improper management. However, as a [[triage]] tool, leading the individual directly to the appropriate specialist for his/her disease, it could be very valuable in the near future.

'''Specialist referral''' is a major area of application in teledermatology A general practitioner (or other medical professional) that sees the individual consults a specialist/ specialised centre via [[telecommunication]] in order to get a second opinion. The specialist then helps the GP in rendering a diagnosis, providing management options et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telederm.org | url = http://www.telederm.org/ | publisher = eDermConsult }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Home telehealth/telehomecare''' involves an individual with a chronic condition being examined and managed remotely at home. An important field of interest of telehomecare in dermatology is the follow-up treatment of individuals with skin conditions requiring regular follow-up such as crural ulcers. Crural ulcers are a common [[skin]] condition that needs follow up visits up to twice a week demanding significant time commitments by the individuals in addition to causing a financial burden on the health care system. Teledermatology can help to reduce the time and costs involved in the follow-up of such conditions.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | vauthors = Binder B, Hofmann-Wellenhof R, Salmhofer W, Okcu A, Kerl H, Soyer HP | title = Teledermatological monitoring of leg ulcers in cooperation with home care nurses | journal = Archives of Dermatology | volume = 143 | issue = 12 | pages = 1511–4 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18086999 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.143.12.1511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and information===
'''Medical education/continuous education''' are a major advantage of telemedicine/e-health. Numerous universities offer online courses, computer-based training and Web applications in this field principally aimed at medical students. Specialist training courses via internet are also available, particularly in [[dermoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IDD International Dermoscopy Diploma | url = http://www.medunigraz.at/IDD | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110113143842/https://www.medunigraz.at/IDD | archive-date = 13 January 2011 | dead-url = yes | publisher =  Medizinische Universität Graz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General medical/health information''' may be accessed by non-professionals, such as individuals affected by a skin condition, and their relatives, through the [[internet]]. They are also able to join peer support groups with others affected by the same condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DermNet NZ | url = http://www.dermnetnz.org | publisher =  New Zealand Dermatological Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domains with special interest==

===Teledermoscopy===
In teledermoscopy, digital dermoscopic [[lesion]] images (with or without clinical images) are transmitted electronically to a specialist for examination. This can be done on the web-based telediagnostic network [http://www.campusmedicus.com Campus Medicus].

[[Dermoscopy]] (dermatoscopy, epiluminescence microscopy) is the technical field of using an epiluminescence [[microscope]] for viewing skin lesions in magnification in-vivo. It is particularly useful in the early detection of malignant skin lesions (i.e., melanoma). Digital dermoscopic images can be taken with a [[digital camera]] attached to a dermatoscope or special video cameras suited for dermoscopy, e.g. the [[Fotofinder|FotoFinder]]. Since dermoscopy is based on examination of a two-dimensional image it is very well suited for digital imaging and teledermatology.

===Teledermatopathology===
Teledermatopathology is the transmission of dermatopathologic images either in real-time with the aid of a robotic microscope or using a store-and-forward system (transmission as a single file). In the latter method (SAF) a rather new development is the introduction of virtual slide systems (VSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Massone C, Soyer HP, Lozzi GP, Di Stefani A, Leinweber B, Gabler G, Asgari M, Boldrini R, Bugatti L, Canzonieri V, Ferrara G, Kodama K, Mehregan D, Rongioletti F, Janjua SA, Mashayekhi V, Vassilaki I, Zelger B, Zgavec B, Cerroni L, Kerl H | display-authors = 6 | title = Feasibility and diagnostic agreement in teledermatopathology using a virtual slide system | journal = Human Pathology | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–54 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17270240 | doi = 10.1016/j.humpath.2006.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual slides are made by digitally scanning an entire glass slide at a high [[Image resolution|resolution]] and then sending the images to a storage system. These can be then assessed on a computer screen similar to conventional microscopy, allowing the [[pathologist]] to maneuver around the image and view every part of the slide at any magnification.

===Teledermoscopically aided dermatopathology===
This is the transmission of crucial medical data and dermoscopic as well as clinical images to a pathologist who renders the conventional histopathologic diagnosis.

In the everyday clinical setting, skin [[biopsies]] are taken by the physician directly responsible for the individual and are assessed by a dermatopathologist. This pathologist has most likely never seen the clinical aspect of the lesion and might not have any information about the person. These limitations can be overcome by teledermoscopically aided dermatopathology whereby a patient history and clinical data may increase the sensitivity of [[diagnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal | vauthors = Bauer J, Leinweber B, Metzler G, Blum A, Hofmann-Wellenhof R, Leitz N, Dietz K, Soyer HP, Garbe C | title = Correlation with digital dermoscopic images can help dermatopathologists to diagnose equivocal skin tumours | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 155 | issue = 3 | pages = 546–51 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16911279 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07342.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally it has been shown that provision of such data may improve the level of diagnostic confidence held by the assessing dermatopathologists.

===Mobile teledermatology===
Mobile telemedicine is a system in which at least one participant (the person seeking advice or the doctor, for instance) uses wireless or mobile equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Handyscope | url = https://www.fotofinder.de/en/technology/skin-cancer-diagnostics/handyscope/ | publisher = FotoFinder Systems GmbH }}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. mobile phones, handheld devices), in contrast to conventional stationary [[telemedicine]] platforms. Travellers who develop skin lesions as well as doctors who are on the move in hospital/non-hospital area can benefit from this new development in teledermatology. In order to facilitate access to medical advice and enable individuals to play a more active role in managing their own health status, mobile teledermatology seems to be especially suited for patient filtering or [[triage]]. (i.e. referral based on the severity and character of their skin condition). Another possible practical application is for follow-up of individuals with chronic skin conditions.

===Suitability of cases===
Not all cases are suitable for teledermatology. The type of cases suited for teledermatology is a topic, which requires more studies. Some studies have observed that eczema and follicular lesions were diagnosed with relatively more certainty, while in some other studies it was seen that diagnoses were made with more certainty in cases like viral warts, herpes zoster, acne vulgaris, irritant dermatitis, vitiligo, and superficial bacterial and fungal infections. Unlike in western studies where pigmented lesions suspicious of melanomas are one of the most referred cases for teledermatology (with or without teledermatoscopy), Asian studies have fewer cases referred based on the suspicion of melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal | vauthors = Kaliyadan F, Venkitakrishnan S | year = 2009 | title = Teledermatology: Clinical case profiles and practical issues | url = | journal = Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 32–5 | doi=10.4103/0378-6323.45217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implemented projects by country==

=== United Kingdom ===
24% of the population in England and Wales seek medical advice for a skin condition, and approximately 6% of patients presenting with a skin problem are referred for specialist advice each year.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield J, Grindlay D, Williams H. Skin conditions in the UK: a health care needs assessment. Nottingham: Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Health encourages the use of digital technology in key areas to support delivery of the quality, innovation, productivity, and prevention (QIPP). This includes the introduction of digital or online services to deliver greater convenience for patients and to free up face-to-face clinical time for individuals who really need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011/12 | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-operating-framework-for-the-nhs-in-england-2011-12 | work = Department of Health | publisher = GOV.UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Teledermatology and teledermoscopy currently exist in different forms in Australia. They assist with combatting the high [[skin cancer]] rates and allows rural patients to access specialist advice without having to travel. However, [[Store and forward|store-and-forward]] teledermatology or teledermoscopy are not currently funded under the Australian national health scheme called [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]]. Research has been done into the economic impact of funding teledermoscopy in the Australian setting, finding that it would cost around $2 for every day that diagnosis or treatment was expedited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snoswell CL, Caffery LJ, Whitty JA, Soyer HP, Gordon LG | title = Cost-effectiveness of Skin Cancer Referral and Consultation Using Teledermoscopy in Australia | journal = JAMA Dermatology | volume = 154 | issue = 6 | pages = 694–700 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29801161 | pmc = 6145645 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2018.0855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian dermatologists have been reported as reflecting on teledermoscopy by saying "that it is valuable, [and] advanced dermatology service" but given the option "they would prefer face-to-face consultation with patients where possible to allow for a full body examination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snoswell CL, Whitty JA, Caffery LJ, Finnane A, Soyer HP | title = What do Australian dermatologists expect to be paid for store-and-forward teledermoscopy? A preliminary investigation | journal = Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare | pages = 1357633X18776766 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29933722 | doi = 10.1177/1357633x18776766 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X18776766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*November 5: Testimony of Michael Schiavo indicates he is attending nursing classes at St. Pete Junior College in order to help his wife.

==1993==

*January: The medical malpractice suit against Terri's obstetrician is settled before an appeal is decided. Terri receives $750,000. Michael receives $300,000. Terri's award is placed in a trust fund controlled by a third party for her medical care.
*February 14: Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers disagree over the course of treatment and therapy for Terri Schiavo. Michael Schiavo claims that the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.  The parties are no longer on speaking terms following this event.
*July 29: The Schindlers begin to challenge Michael Schiavo's guardianship of Terri Schiavo and attempt to remove him as [[legal guardian]].

==1994==

*March 1: Guardian ad litem John H. Pecarek submits his report which states that Michael Schiavo acted appropriately and attentively toward Terri Schiavo.
*In March, Terri is moved to Palm Gardens of Largo, a skilled nursing facility in [[Seminole, Florida]].
*The administration of one nursing home attempts, unsuccessfully, to get a restraining order against Michael because he was demanding more attention for his wife at the expense of other patients' care.
*Michael accepts the diagnosis that Terri is in an irreversible persistent vegetative state. In consultation with Terri's physician, Schiavo halts most therapy for his wife.
*Terri develops a [[urinary tract infection]]. Following a doctor's recommendation, Michael chooses not to treat it. Michael enters a "[[do not resuscitate]]" order, which he later rescinds after the parents protest.

==1995==

*Michael begins his relationship with Jodi Centonze.

==1998==

*May: Michael Schiavo files a petition to discontinue feeding tube for Terri Schiavo. Terri's parents fight the petition.
*June: Richard Pearse, Esq. is appointed guardian ad litem for Terri Schiavo by the [[Circuit Court]] for [[Pinellas County, Florida]].
*September 11: Dr. Jeffrey Karp neurologically evaluates Terri and indicates that she "is in a chronic vegetative state" exhibiting "an absence of voluntary activity or cognitive behavior...inability to communicate or interact purposefully with her environment."  Karp also notes that "her chance of any improvement to a functional level is essentially zero."
*Dr. Gambone, Terri's primary care physician, informs guardian ad litem Richard Pearse that Dr. Karp's PVS diagnosis (and prognosis) is the medical consensus.
*November: Terri's parents become aware of the bone scan report that was performed in 1991. Terri's parents and Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]] claim the trauma shown in the bone scan was a result of Terri being abused by Michael. Provided with only the scan information, forensic pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden suggests a head injury caused the trauma. After learning Terri's full history, Dr. Baden agrees that the trauma is consistent with her cardiac arrest, fall, [[CPR]] attempts, and eventual [[resuscitation]]. The parents petition the Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court for a full evidentiary hearing to evaluate the new evidence. Judge [[George Greer]] denies the motion.
*December 29: The second [[guardian ad litem]], Richard Pearse, submits his report to the Pinellas-Pasco County Circuit Court.  Pearse concludes that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state with no possibility of improvement and that Michael Schiavo's decisions may be influenced by the potential to inherit what remains of Terri Schiavo's estate.  Due to a perceived lack of evidence for Terri's wishes, and questions regarding Michael Schiavo's credibility, Pearse recommends denying Michael Schiavo's petition to remove Terri's feeding tube.

==2000==

*Michael is issued a license for nursing by the State of Florida, Department of Health.
*February: As a result of Michael's petition in 1998, the court rules that Terri would choose to have the tube removed.
*April: Terri is transferred to Woodside Hospice in Pinellas Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehospice.org/WoodsideHoliday.htm thehospice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001==

*Dr. Ron Cranford, neurologist, assesses Terri's brain function as part of a court-ordered examination. His exam shows that Terri's cerebral cortex has been completely destroyed; he finds that her upper brain is 80% destroyed, and there is much damage to the lower brain.
*April 26: Terri's feeding tube is removed for the first time. It is reinserted two days later on an appeal by her parents.

==2002==

*A trial is held to determine whether or not new therapy treatments would help Terri restore any cognitive function.
:A new [[Computed axial tomography|CAT scan]] shows severe cerebral [[atrophy]]. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] shows no measurable brain activity.

:Five doctors are selected to provide their expert opinions to the trial. Schiavo's parents select Dr. William Maxfield, a retired radiologist, and Dr. [[William Hammesfahr]], a neurologist. Michael Schiavo selects neurologists Dr. Ron Cranford and Dr. Melvin Greer (no relation to Judge George Greer). The court selects neurologist Dr. Peter Bambakidis. These five doctors examine Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Schiavo herself.

:Dr. Cranford, Dr. Greer, and Dr. Bambakidis testify that Terri was in a persistent vegetative state. Dr. Maxfield and Dr. Hammesfahr testify that Schiavo was in a "minimally conscious state."

:Terri's parents videotape Terri for four and a half hours. The video is edited down to several clips totaling four and a half minutes.

:Judge Greer rules that Terri Schiavo is in a PVS and was beyond hope of significant improvement.

*Fall 2002: Jodi Centonze gives birth to her first child with Michael.
*November 22: Judge Greer denies a motion from Terri's parents for a full evidentiary hearing to evaluate new evidence, the 1990 bone scan, which had only recently come to their attention. Greer states that the issue of trauma twelve years earlier was irrelevant to the current case.
*Florida's Second District Court of Appeal reviews previous court records and upholds the trial court's decision.

== 2003 ==

* September 11: The Schindlers petition the Pinellas County court for the Sixth Judicial Circuit.  The petition asks the court to forestall any removal of the feeding tube for "eight weeks' therapy."  Accompanying the petition are five [[affidavit]]s: four from members of the Schindler family (presumably her mother, father, brother, and sister) and one from Dr. Alexander T. Gimon.  Additional affidavits from three "speech professionals" and two nurses are included.
*September 17: Judge Greer issues a nine-page court ruling, rejecting the petition.
* October 10: The final remaining appeal filed by the Schindlers is dismissed.
* October 15: Terri's feeding tube is removed for the second time.
* October 21: The Florida Legislature passes "Terri's Law." Governor [[Jeb Bush]] immediately orders the feeding tube reinserted.
* December: Dr. Jay Wolfson reports to Governor Bush, "within the testimony, as part of the hypotheticals presented, Schindler family members stated that even if (Terri) had told them of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn, they would not do it.  Throughout this painful and difficult trial, the family acknowledged that (Terri) was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abstractappeal.com/schiavo/WolfsonReport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2004 ==

* Spring 2004: Jodi Centonze gives birth to her second child with Michael.
* May 19: Florida Judge W. Douglas Baird overturns "Terri's Law". The ruling is appealed.

*March 17: Members of the [[Florida Legislature]] consider a bill that would make removing food and water from patients in a persistent vegetative state illegal without a living will. Although the bill is passed by the [[Florida House of Representatives]] by a vote of 78 to 37, the [[Florida Senate]] defeats a similar measure hours later, 21 to 18.
*March 17: U.S. Senators [[Bill Frist]] and [[Michael Enzi]] announce that Terri Schiavo would be called to testify before the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] on March 28 in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. No one expects Terri to testify, but the move extends [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection]] to Terri, requiring reinsertion of her feeding tube.
*March 18: Greer strikes down the subpoena as unconstitutional and Terri's feeding tube is removed for the third and final time.
*March 20/21: [[U.S. Congress]] approves emergency legislation, the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]].

*March 22: Judge James D. Whittemore refuses to order the feeding tube reinserted.
*March 22: Three Florida neurologists view 12 of Terri's [[computed tomography|CT]] scans. Dr. Leon Prockop says it was the "most severe brain damage I've seen." Dr. Walter Bradley says that he "doubts there's any activity going on in the higher levels of her brain." Dr. Michael T. Pulley says, "The chance that this person is going to recover is about zero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/nation/11213061.htm|title=KC Breaking News, Sports, Weather &amp; More - The Kansas City Star &amp; KansasCity.com The Kansas City Star|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*March 23: Bob and Mary Schindler appeal again to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].
*March 24: The U.S. Supreme Court declines to grant [[certiorari]].  Judge Greer issues an injunction denying the Florida State government's right to have the Florida Department of Children &amp; Families take over Schiavo's care.
*March 27: Terri is given the [[Anointing of the Sick]] ("Last Rites").
*March 30: The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in [[Atlanta]] agrees to consider a petition by Mrs. Schiavo's parents to have a new hearing to decide whether the feeding tube should be reinserted. Later that day, the court denies the petition.

A '''vaginal septum''' is a [[vaginal anomalies|vaginal anomaly]] that is partition within the [[vagina]]; such a [[septum]] could be either longitudinal or transverse. In some affected women, the septum is partial or does not extend the length or width of the vagina.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinonen|first=Pentti K.|date=2006-03-01|title=Complete septate uterus with longitudinal vaginal septum|url=http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(05)03968-3/fulltext|journal=Fertility and Sterility|language=English|volume=85|issue=3|pages=700–705|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.039|issn=0015-0282}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dyspareunia|Pain during intercourse]] can be a symptom. A longitudinal vaginal septum develops during [[embryogenesis]] when there is an incomplete fusion of the lower parts of the two [[Müllerian duct]]s. As a result, there may appear to be two openings to the vagina. There may be associated duplications of the more cranial parts of the Müllerian derivatives, a double [[cervix]], and either a [[uterine septum]] or [[uterus didelphys]] (double uterus).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perez-Brayfield MR, Clarke HS, Pattaras JG |title=Complete bladder, urethral, and vaginal duplication in a 50-year-old woman |journal=Urology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=514 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12350504 |doi=10.1016/S0090-4295(02)01808-3  |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090429502018083}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transverse septum forms during embryogenesis when the Müllerian ducts do not fuse to the [[urogenital sinus]]. A complete transverse septum can occur across the vagina at different levels.

A '''Vendor Neutral Archive''' ('''VNA''') is a [[medical imaging]] technology in which images and documents (and potentially any file of clinical relevance) are stored (archived) in a standard format with a standard interface, such that they can be accessed in a vendor-neutral manner by other systems.

This terminology is used as distinct from a traditional [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems]] (PACS), although there is debate about where the boundary between a VNA and a PACS lies along the continuum of their common features.

==Definition==
The simplest definition is "a medical device that stores medical images in a standard format with a standard interface, such that they can be accessed in a vendor-neutral manner by other systems".

So-called "vendor neutrality" is implied by the standard format and interface, and the neutrality is with respect to vendor-specific devices that produce or consume those images (e.g., for display, distribution or analysis, with or without specific workflows, such as for radiology reporting, i.e., a [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]]).

The exact definition and feature set is contentious though, and evolves as different vendors of VNAs attempt to distinguish themselves from their competitors and avoid being excluded, and customers express desires ranging from pragmatic to fantastic.

There is general agreement on the following key features:

* Storage of [[DICOM]] images and related composite objects (presentation states, key objects, structured reports)
* DICOM network standard interface for storage, query and retrieval
* Administrative updates and corrections (patient ID changes and study merges)
* [[Scalability]]

Each of the following features remain contentious, in the sense that some customers and vendors claim that some or all are fundamental to the concept, but others disagree:

* Storage of objects not directly related to images (such as human-generated requests and reports)
* Storage of non-DICOM content (such as [[HL7]] [[Clinical Document Architecture|CDA]] documents)
* Non-DICOM access protocols (such as IHE Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing ([[Cross Enterprise Document Sharing|XDS]] and XDS-I)
* Cross-domain identity and code resolution (patient ID, accession #, procedure codes)
* Dynamic DICOM tag morphing
* [[Information lifecycle management]]
* Exclusion of workflow management database content
* Independence from choice of database engine
* Audit trail of access

==History==

===Evolution===
Traditionally, the need to store medical images has been most common in the radiology and nuclear medicine departments, and has been implemented in the form of sub-specialty and departmental (PACS), which have combined the functions of image management and image archiving into a single solution. Whilst such systems all have standard interfaces ([[DICOM]] and [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]]) for ingestion and distribution of images over the network and on physical media (like CD), typically the workflow and optimal performance for display are achieved using proprietary software and protocols. Further, the persistent storage "inside" a proprietary PACS may not be in a standard form, the PACS may not update the stored files with the latest study and demographic updates and annotations stored in the database, and it may extend, abuse or depend on specific standard and non-standard (private) DICOM attributes in the stored files.

Over time, in many implementations, the underlying storage infrastructure has been "factored" out of the traditional (PACS) at the hardware and file system ([[Direct-attached storage|DAS]], [[Network-attached storage|NAS]], [[Storage area network|SAN]]) level, and are supplied instead by non-domain-specific [[computer data storage]] vendors.

As more medical specialties incorporate images in their practice, the need to extend image storage and distribution capability to other departments, enterprise wide. Increasingly there is a desire to inter-operate at a higher application level, separating departmental-specific workflows, display and analysis solutions from image storage infrastructure, using standard protocols that are image and metadata aware, without sacrificing display performance.

A complicating factor is that the (PACS) offerings are in a constant state of flux with respect to features and quality of service, and traditionally users will abandon one vendor and replace their product with another's every 3–5 years. This triggers the need to "migrate" the images and associated information to the new architecture without data loss, a non-trivial task despite the use of standard formats for image encoding. The concept of a VNA theoretically allows for greater stability (re-usability and less frequent migration) at the archive level, despite rapid evolution and change at the higher application-level (display and workflow). Of course, migrating from one vendor's VNA to another isn't trivial either, just hopefully less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnie|first=Aunt|title=Vendor Neutral Archive (Migration)|url=http://www.auntminnie.com/forum/tm.aspx?high=&amp;m=333472|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative term for a VNA is a "PACS Neutral Archive", which perhaps better conveys the original intent, but this term is rarely used, and for better or for worse, VNA has become the [[buzzword]] of choice amongst customers and salesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Is it a PACS-Neutral Archive or Vendor-Neutral Archive?|url=http://www.graycons.com/news/is-it-a-pacs-neutral-archive-or-vendor-neutral-archive/|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
As noted above, the archive of images was naturally mostly static—that is, most of the content of an archive is unchanged, with only a (relatively) small number of examinations added each day. On the other hand, the PACS workstation benefits from the rapid advance of technology. Therefore, it was suggested as early as 1998 that it would be desirable to separate these such that the archive was independent of the workstation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Bradley|date=1998|title=The Evolution of Electronic Imaging in the Medical Environment|url=|journal=J Digit Imaging|volume=11|issue=Suppl 1|pages=71–74|doi=10.1007/BF03168264|pmc=3453350|access-date=|pmid=9735437}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that article it was noted that one or more 'Independent DICOM Archives' could achieve this benefit and even provide inter-enterprise image sharing. The article also noted the practical challenges at the time—namely the relative inefficiency of doing DICOM queries against such multiple archives and separating out those responses relevant for pre-fetching, as well as challenges of patient identifiers. Never-the-less, the ability to have images in a separate system from the workstation was felt to be an important capability, and ultimately, Erickson and colleagues developed this into a startup company, TeraMedica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teramedica.com|title=Teramedica, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000, which was purchased by Fuji Medical Systems in 2015.

A long running Aunt Minnie PACS Forum thread digressed to discuss the issue of neutral archives amongst a broader audience after a response from Michael Gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minnie|first=Aunt|title=RE: The Dalai's Laws of PACS|url=http://www.auntminnie.com/forum/tm.aspx?high=&amp;m=101689&amp;mpage=1#102308|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Gray offers his essential ingredients of a VNA in his 2009 blog entry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Essential Ingredients of a PACS-Neutral Archive|url=http://www.graycons.com/pacs-neutral-archive/essential-ingredients-of-a-pacs-neutral-archive/|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; making reference to Acuo's checklist of attributes, the most recent form of which can be found in Shannon Werb's white paper on attributes of a "true" VNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Werb|first=Shannon|title=12 Attributes of a True Vendor Neutral Archive|url=http://www.acuotech.com/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=tag&amp;tag=white%20paper&amp;app_id=1&amp;Itemid=632|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Oosterwijk provides a more recent description on behalf of another vendor, Teramedica, in his white paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oosterwijk|first=Herman|title=What is a VNA anyway?|url=http://www.himss.org/files/HIMSSorg/content/files/TeraMedicaWhatisaVNA.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-22|date=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he offers a more detailed definition: "A Vendor Neutral Archive (VNA) is a medical device that provides scalable image and information and life cycle management so that images and related information can be queried, stored, and retrieved in a manner that is defined by open standards at multiple department, enterprise, and regional level while maintaining patient privacy and security. Characteristic for a VNA is that it provides a patient-centric approach that transcends upgrades and changes of the different viewing, acquisition, and workflow management components as they should be interchangeable without having to migrate, convert, or change the data formats or interface of the VNA."

The relationship of VNA to storage of medical images in the [[cloud storage|cloud]] is also nebulous, though offers high potential for [[buzzword compliant|buzzword compliance]], and Michael Gray provides some clarity in his paper commissioned by EMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Cloud Infrastructure in Vendor Neutral Archive Configurations|url=http://www.graycons.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Cloud-Infrastructure-and-VNA.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the term "VNA" has been so abused as a marketing term, it has already achieved mythical status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Dave|title=Top 5 Myths About Vendor Neutral Archives|url=http://blogs.hds.com/hdsblog/2011/02/top-5-myths-about-vendor-neutral-archives.html|accessdate=2014-07-10|date=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Administrative updates and corrections===
A passive archive will simply store what it receives, and potentially overwrite the same thing when it is received again with changes but the same (unique) identifiers. This is insufficient in a production operation, where mistakes are made, and it is necessary to correct patient demographics, or correct mistakes (wrong patient or request or side was selected during an exam and incorrect information present in the image headers).

Standards exist that cover some use cases, such as IHE Patient Information Reconciliation (PIR) and Imaging Object Change Management (IOCM).

===Cross-domain identity and code resolution===
For an archive to span departments, institutions, regions or even national boundaries, the question of identification of entities and concepts must be addressed.

In general, within a domain such as an individual institution, patient identifiers and identifiers of request, studies and reports (e.g., by accession numbers) are assigned uniquely within that domain, but not outside. Most internal systems (and most [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]]) do not manage the existence of multiple identity domains, and if identifiers are used across domains then collisions and ambiguity occur. Thus each identifier needs to either be qualified by its "assigning authority" when used (the approach taken by the [[DICOM]]-based [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]] Multiple Image Manager Archive (MIMA) profile) or coerced into a single "canonical" identifier that spans the scope of the larger domain that includes all integrated cross-enterprise systems (the approach taken by IHE [[Cross Enterprise Document Sharing]]. When importing outside images into the local archive, this matter also has to be addressed, usually by mapping the outside identifier into an internal identifier and re-encoding the information (coercion) in the DICOM "header" or other meta-data (such as by the manner specified in Import Reconciliation Workflow).

Whether support for this is an essential feature for a VNA depends on what environment it is intended to be deployed in (within one enterprise or across enterprises), but robust support provides insurance against future deployment configuration changes (such as enterprise mergers).

Likewise, local code sets used for such things as procedure codes (for "orderables", as opposed to billing codes), are not well standardized, and where these are useful in images to drive workflow and display (such as hanging protocols), an ability to map these too is a useful feature.

===Dynamic tag morphing===
One purpose of a VNA is to store information and serve it to multiple systems that may have different requirements for its use and expectations for very specific characteristics of the DICOM attributes and values stored in them, both standard and private.

The concept of "dynamic tag morphing" is touted as a solution to the problem of two different systems expecting different values in the same attribute. "Tag morphing" refers to changing the values in one or more attributes (usually DICOM data elements in this context). This may be done "statically", in which case only one mapping is performed, or "dynamically", in which case multiple mappings, each specific to a particular recipient, is performed.

In its degenerate form, the ability to map any tag and value to any other is inherently dangerous and undermines the value of attempting to standardize attributes in the first place, and the efforts by modality and PACS vendors to use them "properly". That said, there is variation in the installed base and even new products in how some fields are used, particularly for highly specific and advanced forms of imaging, and corresponding variation in what advanced display and analysis applications expect in their input. Accordingly this is a popular feature, despite its dangers. Some will argue strongly that it is an essential feature to be classed as a VNA.

This feature is reminiscent of what is common in the [[HL7]] version 2 world, a so-called Interface Engine, which is designed to map pretty much anything to anything else, depending on the source and target.

A typical use case is to change the values in Series Description supplied by acquisition modalities, in order to allow two different PACS sharing the same data to use different hanging protocol rules based in Series Description. Arguably, this could be achieved in a more standard way if modalities populated other attributes in more detail, acquisition protocols and codes for them were better standardized and hanging protocol engines were more flexible, but given the limitations of the state of the art, this technique remains useful.

Dynamic tag morphing is distinct from the specific attribute changes related to Cross-domain Identity and Code Resolution (what DICOM in PS 3.4 refers to as "coercion"), for which there are standards defined for what to change, when and how, and which often involve additional actors such as a Master Patient Index, though some proponents lump these together and some products implement them using the same mechanism.

Michael Gray was an early proponent of tag morphing and regards it an essential VNA feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=DICOM Tag Morphing – Essential Ingredient in Enterprise PACS Archive|url=http://www.graycons.com/pacs-technologies/dicom-tag-morphing-essential-ingredient-in-enterprise-pacs-archive/|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2007-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A description of tag morphing use-cases can be found in Wayne Dejarnette's 2010 white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dejarnette|first=Wayne|title=Context Management and Tag Morphing in the Real World|url=http://www.vendorneutralarchive.com/Literature/Context%20Management%20and%20Tag%20Morphing%20in%20the%20Real%20World.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information lifecycle management===
Disk is cheap, though power and air-conditioning are not, but regardless, storage has a finite cost, particularly when one is paying as one goes rather than using a locally hosted capitalized infra-structure.

Accordingly, when medico-legal retention periods expire, or the clinical utility expires (such as on a patient's death), many users would like to be able to purge their storage. The rules for this are complex, and vary between jurisdictions as well as according to local policy. Given the conflicting demands of financiers, risk managers, litigators, researchers and educators, coming to agreement on such a policy may be difficult.

Regardless, a potentially useful VNA feature is support for locally customizable rule-based purging (culling) criteria, whether it be by implementing the rules directly, or responding to IHE Imaging Object Change Management (IOCM) requests from a separate rules engine.

===Non-DICOM content===
VNAs should have no difficulty storing DICOM content such images and associated information such as presentation states and so-called "evidence documents", such as DICOM Structured Reports containing such things as measurements recorded by the modality, or post-processing results such as from [[Computer-aided diagnosis|CAD]].

In a clinical setting, however, other document and bulk object types may be available that it would be desirable to store. Most PACS take the approach of converting these to DICOM, in some cases using objects intended to "encapsulate" another type of object. The classic example is a scanned document stored as a PDF file and encapsulated in a DICOM PDF object along with sufficient metadata to identify it and manage it, as if it were an image. VNAs should support these type of encapsulated DICOM objects and the DICOM "header" provides a means to obtain the metadata for indexing to support query and retrieval. Michael Gray elaborates in detail on this topic in his white paper on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Michael|title=Best Practices Strategy for Dealing with non-DICOM Data objects in a PACS-Neutral Archive|url=http://www.merge.com/MergeHealthcare/media/documents/whitepapers/Best_Practices_Strategy_for_non-DICOM_data_in_Neutral_Archive.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other object types, or when there is no DICOM encapsulation object available, or when there is no need to interface with DICOM systems, as long as there is a standard means of providing the necessary metadata for indexing, such as by using HL7 version 2 messages or XDS registry services, then in theory a VNA could store anything.

Specific types of non-DICOM content, such as an HL7 CDA document instance containing, for example, a radiology report, could be stored either as a XDS, or first encapsulated in a DICOM Encapsulated CDA object and stored using DICOM services, or its content and header could be transcoded into a DICOM Structured Report instance. A fully featured VNA might have the ability to transcode any single instance into another form depending on what the requesting system needed ("object morphing", if you will).

A description of Wayne Dejarnette's approach to non-DICOM object storage in his product is described in his 2009 white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dejarnette|first=Wayne|title=Archiving of non-DICOM data with xDL|url=http://www.vendorneutralarchive.com/Literature/Archiving%20of%20non-DICOM%20data%20with%20xDL.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-18|date=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface standardization==

===Image file format on long term storage media===
There is general agreement that the use of the DICOM file format is required for images, and that where images are compressed for archival or transport, standard, not proprietary, compression schemes (transfer syntaxes) need to be used. Indeed, a distinguishing feature of most VNAs as opposed to many traditional PACS is the avoidance of proprietary internal formats ostensibly used in the past for "performance" reasons, whilst still obtaining good performance across the interfaces.

Implementations may vary in the range of supported compression schemes, whether or not reversible (lossless) compression is mandatory for medico-legal archival purposes. Implementations also vary in the range of modality-specific image types that they support; though many archives will support all DICOM image information objects in principle, some extreme cases, like whole slide pathology images and long videos may not be supported. A general feature of VNAs is to attempt to preserve all attributes as originally supplied, including private (proprietary) attributes whether from the acquisition modality or added by other intervening applications (such as QC workstations or PACS).

DICOM describes many different "Information Object Definitions" and "SOP Classes" for storage of images with specific metadata related to particular modalities and applications, and the list of these grows as technology evolves. Since the DICOM format is inherently extensible, and all new objects build upon a common encoding and pattern, a VNAs should be able to store any DICOM image object, regardless of whether the SOP Class is recognized or new. This may be achieved through the use of field-modifiable configuration to add new SOP Classes, or by analysis of the contents of the objects "header", or by the simple of approach of accepting, storing and regurgitating anything transferred via a DICOM C-STORE operation.

===Image transfer protocols===

====Conventional DICOM====
Support of the basic DICOM C-STORE, C-FIND, C-MOVE and preferably C-GET are fundamental and not debated. The basic uncompressed transfer syntaxes including implicit and explicit VR little-endian, and the less common big-endian transfer syntax are typically supported. The range of compressed transfer syntaxes usually includes [[lossless JPEG]] and reversible and irreversible [[JPEG 2000]], occasionally [[JPEG-LS]], and usually lossy JPEG for images that were supplied that way (especially true color photographs. Support for motion compression (other than multi-frame JPEG) is less common, but perhaps more common in VNAs than in [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]]s, especially for storage and regurgitation without viewing.

====WADO====
Most would agree that an important VNA interface is the original version of [[Web Access to DICOM Persistent Objects]] (WADO), which allows single images to be retrieved with an [[HTTP]] URL in either DICOM file format or pre-rendered into a consumer format like [[JPEG]].

====XDS-I.b====
The [[SOAP]] [[Web Service]] based transactions of the IHE Cross Enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging are also generally considered a prerequisite for a claim to be a VNA.

===Image-related objects===

====Presentation states====
The grayscale or color rendering transformation applied to images for display should be stored as a DICOM Presentation State object. These objects support grayscale and true color images, as well as the application of a pseudo-color [[lookup table]] to grayscale images. Presentation states can also record any zooming and panning (displayed area selection) applied. [[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]] uses these in the Consistent Presentation of Images (CPI) profile

Since many modern [[Picture Archiving and Communications Systems|PACS]] can also store image annotations using DICOM Presentation State objects, a VNA needs to support these, including not just storage and regurgitation, but also selection and display in any viewer supplied as a VNA component.

====Annotations, regions of interest and measurements====
The preferred format for storage of [[annotation]]s, [[Region of Interest|regions of interest]], and [[measurement]]s is the DICOM Structured Report (SR) object, which allows structure, coded and semantic information to be persisted, rather than just presentation. IHE refers to these as Evidence Documents (ED). DICOM SR objects may also be produced in the context of the IHE specifies these in the Simple Image and Numeric Report (SINR) profile.

Since many Acquisition Modalities, mammography CAD systems and quantitative image analysis workstations produce SR objects, a VNA should be capable of storing and regurgitating these. Ideally, any viewer component should be capable of a generic (if not ideal) rendering of the content of any SR, including display of coordinates on referenced images.

For specific domains, such as [[Radiotherapy]], an older format, the DICOM RT Structure Set, which can encode 3D patient relative coordinate [[isocontour]]s (only) is used, and some non-RT workstations produce these as well instead of SRs. A VNA needs to support these too.

====Key images and object selection====
A common concept in a PACS is for the user (such as a modality operator or interpreting radiologist) to flag some images (or other objects) as being "key", i.e., of particular interest for some reason. Though obsolete PACS may only record this as a flag in an internal database, modern PACS use the [[DICOM]] Key Object Selection object (a specialized form of SR) to export this information. This usage is described in the IHE Key Image Note (KIN) profile. A VNA needs to support storage and regurgitation of KOS objects, as well as selection and display of these in any viewer.

====Radiation dose reports====
Since many medical imaging techniques deliver non-trivial amounts of ionizing radiation to the patient, the dose exposure needs to be tracked, and in some jurisdictions this must be recorded by law. DICOM defines a specialized form of Structured Report, the Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR) to encode this. IHE uses these in the Radiation Exposure Management (REM) profile. A VNA must support storage and regurgitation these, and ideally, would be able to extract critical information for display in any viewer.

====Procedure reports====
In radiology and nuclear medicine applications, the practice of dictating and transcribing (or using [[speech recognition]]) is well entrenched and the output of these is typically unstructured or minimally structured prose, encoded as plain text and distributed by fax or HL7 version 2 messages or some equally primitive mechanism. The persistent form of these "documents" is not well-standardized, but many customers expect a VNA to be able to accept them in whatever local format is preferred. The same principles apply as for the storage of any non-DICOM content, including the use of HL7 version 2 messages or XDS to provide metadata in lieu of a structured "header", such as in the case of reports rendered as PDF, when they have not been encapsulated in DICOM or CDA objects. Now that HL7 has promised to relax its previously closed IP policy, including offering CDA free for use, it is possible that CDA will become the preferred form of encoding, but VNAs will still need to accept (and possibly transcode) reports in a plethora of form from the installed base. DICOM defines templates for the encoding of human-generated reports as DICOM Structured Report (SR) objects, and IHE specifies these in the Simple Image and Numeric Report (SINR) profile.

====Radiotherapy objects====
In addition to DICOM RT Structure Sets, for a VNA to be usable in an enterprise that performs Radiotherapy, the entire family of DICOM RT objects for beam, ion and [[brachytherapy]] need to be stored and regurgitated.

====Raw data objects====
DICOM defines a Raw Data object that is essentially a conventional DICOM composite instance header with patient, study, series and instance information, but no payload. It was intended for the storage of the [[raw data]] that is not easily represented as an image or image-like object, such as the raw views obtained from the detectors of a CT scanner, or the [[k-space (MRI)|k-space]] data from an MRI scanner, but can be used to encode anything. A VNA should be able to store and regurgitate these, even though it may be unaware of their contents and only the originating device may be able to interpret them.

====Audio, waveform and spectroscopy objects====
Though there are many consumer formats for encoding audio in widespread use, these lack the header or metadata necessary to identify the patient and encounter. A VNA that wants to support these needs to have a means of providing such information, such as submission using XDS. [[DICOM]] does define a Basic Audio object, and though it does not support the plethora of audio codecs available in the consumer world, some PACS do produce them, so a VNA should support these.

Time-based waveforms (such as ECGs) may be stored as DICOM or in a multitude of other formats, and the same principles apply as for audio; i.e., if the format is a medically oriented one, use the header meta-data for indexing during ingestion, if not, use XDS to register it.

A DICOM [[MR Spectroscopy]] object is defined, and since some modalities produce it, a VNA should be able to store and regurgitate instances of it.

====Private objects====
DICOM allows for the concept of Private SOP Classes, which use the DICOM encoding and transfer mechanisms but whose content is opaque. Vendors use these to good effect when necessary to encode information that has not been standardized, and also abuse them for convenience in lieu of using a standard encoding. Regardless, since their content may be important to the clinical workflow, a VNA should be configurable to accept, store and regurgitate these.

==Use cases==
* On site serving of images to multiple PACS
* Off site serving of images to multiple PACS
* Direct viewing of images (locally or externally)
* [[High Availability]]
* [[Business Continuity]] and [[Disaster Recovery]]

==Spectrum of vendor offerings==
Given the convoluted history, it should come as no surprise that two products claiming to be VNAs may have completely different feature sets and performance. However, there are essentially four categories of product:

* Third-party systems that have developed independently of PACS
* Offsite archival systems originally intended for BC/DR
* Central repository products that support cross-enterprise &amp; external access
* Traditional PACS that have improved standard access to their internal archive

The heritage of any individual product line may be a significant factor when considering suitability for a different application than originally intended, despite the purported feature set as re-envisaged by a creative marketing department.

==Market==
The size of the global VNA market is small relative to the PACS market, but is purported to be growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Imaging Technology News|title=VNA, PACS Market Worth $3.48 Billion by 2018|url=http://www.itnonline.com/article/vna-pacs-market-worth-348-billion-2018|accessdate=2015-12-21|date=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
