'''Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph''' (born October 22, 1992), better known by his stage name '''21 Savage''', is an American [[rapper]], record producer, and songwriter from [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Abraham-Joseph grew up around criminality and eventually dropped out of school, beginning to rap in 2013 after the death of a friend. He gained attention in the [[Atlanta]] underground for the 2015 mixtape ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'' before attaining nationwide attention following the [[Metro Boomin]] collaborative album ''[[Savage Mode]]'' (2016), its lead single "[[X (21 Savage and Metro Boomin song)|X]]", and his collaboration with Drake, "[[Sneakin']]".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview|title=21 Savage chops it up with Seth Rogen|date=2018-04-26|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He achieved his first number one single at the end of 2017 with his feature on [[Post Malone]]'s "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]."&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/10/post-malone-21-savage-rockstar-no-1-billboard-hot-100-chart/|title=Post Malone's ''Rockstar'' Hits No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=XXL Magazine|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he also released the [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]] and Metro Boomin collaboration ''[[Without Warning (21 Savage, Offset and Metro Boomin album)|Without Warning]]''.

==Early life==

In the seventh grade, Abraham-Joseph was banned permanently from every school in the [[DeKalb County School District]] due to gun possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmVcwIyKo|title=21 Savage Interview With The Breakfast Club (8-4-16)|date=August 4, 2016|people=[[Charlamagne tha God]], [[DJ Envy]]|publisher=[[The Breakfast Club (radio show)]]|location=[[New York City]]|access-date=May 6, 2018|medium=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led him to begin attending schools around the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] before being sent to a youth detention center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-21-savage-news.22853.html|title=Everything You Need To Know About 21 Savage|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released from the youth detention center, he completed eighth grade through an alternative program before finishing a semester of high school, dropping out in his freshman year following multiple exclusions which Abraham-Joseph said he was "exhausted" by.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/08/04/21-savage-the-breakfast-club-interview|title=21 Savage Talks Being An "A" Student, Losing His Best Friends On The Breakfast Club|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dropping out, Abraham-Joseph joined a gang affiliated with the [[Bloods]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and became a full-time drug dealer, mainly selling cannabis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; He also took parts in other criminal activities including robbery and grand theft auto regularly, though only being arrested once after contraband was found in a car he was driving.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/21-savage-profile-2018|title=21 Savage: From Robbin’ Season to Role Model|last=Wood|first=Samuel Hine, Geordie|date=2018-06-27|work=GQ|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, when Abraham-Joseph was 19, he lost his "right hand" man, Larry in a shootout.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 2013, on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph was shot six times and his brother Johnny "Tay-Man" was killed during an attempted robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|website=[[The Fader]]|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===2014–15: Early releases===
Following the death of his friend in a shootout on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph began rapping, naming himself after the event&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; though Savage came from Instagram predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/features/facts/21-savage/|title=19 Facts You Need To Know About 'Rockstar' Rapper 21 Savage|work=Capital XTRA|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His music career was originally subsidized by the uncle of his deceased friend, giving him money for studio time in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On November 12, 2014, 21 Savage's debut single, "Picky", produced by DJ Plugg, was released. It was later included on his debut mixtape, ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'', which was released on May 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/34127/21-savage-the-slaughter-tape.html|title=21 Savage - The Slaughter Tape|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release made him what [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] called an "underground hero in Atlanta."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On July 2, 2015, 21 released a collaborative EP, ''Free Guwop'', with [[Sonny Digital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/35036/21-savage-free-guwop-ep.html|title=21 Savage - Free Guwop EP|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tribute EP to fellow rapper and influence [[Gucci Mane]].

In 2017, his debut studio album, ''[[Issa Album]]'', reached at number two on the US ''Billboard'' 200 chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7866158/21-savage-haim-billboard-200-albums-chart-top-10|title=21 Savage &amp; Haim Debut in Top 10 on Billboard 200 Albums Chart|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 16, 2017|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lead single, "[[Bank Account (song)|Bank Account]]", charted in the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://headlineplanet.com/home/2017/08/08/hot-100-niall-horans-slow-hands-enters-top-15-21-savages-bank-account-top-20/|title=Hot 100: Niall Horan’s "Slow Hands" Enters Top 15, 21 Savage’s "Bank Account" Top 20|date=August 7, 2017|work=Headline Planet|access-date=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he was featured on [[Post Malone]]'s single "[[Rockstar (Post Malone song)|Rockstar]]", which peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and broke several records.&lt;ref name="XXL Magazine2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/post-malone-rockstar-breaks-spotify-global-record/|title=Post Malone Breaks Spotify Global Record With ''Rockstar'' - XXL|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8031270/post-malone-rockstar-platinum-21-savage|title=Post Malone &amp; 21 Savage's 'Rockstar' Is Now Certified Platinum|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Abraham-Joseph had a guest appearance on [[Young Thug]]'s extended play ''[[Hear No Evil (Young Thug EP)|Hear No Evil]]'' along with fellow rappers [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/04/13/young-thug-hear-no-evil-nicki-minaj-21-savage|title=Young Thug drops Hear No Evil EP|last=Maicki|first=Salvatore|date=April 13, 2018|website=The Fader|access-date=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month he also appeared on the single "Outstanding" by [[SahBabii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/04/sahbabii-21-savage-new-song-outstanding/|title=Listen to SahBabii and 21 Savage's New Song "Outstanding"|last=India|first=Lindsey|date=April 20, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 21 he was featured on the single "Rover 2.0", which is part of [[BlocBoy JB]]'s [[Simi (mixtape)|Simi]] mixtape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1988300/blocboy-jb-rover-2-0-feat-21-savage/music/|title=BlocBoy JB – "Rover 2.0" (Feat. 21 Savage)|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=March 23, 2018|website=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/05/blocboy-jb-simi-mixtape/|title=BlocBoy JB Drops 'Simi' Mixtape Featuring Drake, Lil Pump and More|last=Coleman II|first=C. Vernon|date=May 4, 2018|website=XXL Magazine|publisher=Townsquare Media|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month, he was featured on [[Ty Dolla Sign]]'s "Clout", which is part of the upcoming deluxe edition of last years's ''[[Beach House 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Darville|first=Jordan|date=May 9, 2018|title=Ty Dolla $ign recruits 21 Savage for "Clout"|url=http://www.thefader.com/2018/05/09/ty-dolla-sign-21-savage-clout|magazine=The Fader|location=New York City|access-date=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2018, [[Halloween]], Abraham-Joseph posted on his Instagram a picture of a man in silhouette jumping in the air in the direction away from a large blaze. In the bottom right corner of the picture there is a "Parental Advisory" notice, as there oftentimes is on the cover of rap releases. Abraham-Joseph also tagged Metro Boomin in the post. For these reasons, some speculated it to be a sequel to 2017's ''Without Warning'' record. However, it turned out to be the cover for Metro’s debut solo album, ''[[Not All Heroes Wear Capes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnfcqeBtAT/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=21savage|title=Saint Laurent Don on Instagram: "y’all know what season it is @metroboomin 4L"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style ==
Called "one of the last street niggas left making music" by frequent collaborator Metro Boomin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph's music is heavily autobiographic with emphasis on violent and criminal aspects of his past including murder and drug dealing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2018, 21 Savage reportedly started a movement called "Guns Down, Paintballs Up" which was intended to reduce gun violence.&lt;ref name="CBS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paintball-wars-initially-intended-to-curb-gun-violence-linked-to-2-deaths/|title="Paintball wars," initially intended to curb gun violence, linked to 2 deaths|last=Diaz|first=Adriana|date=May 1, 2018|website=[[CBS News]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the [[Detroit Police Department]], [[James Craig (police chief)|James Craig]], described the movement as "well-intentioned, however, misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paint-up-guns-down-detroit-paintball-arrests-2018-04-27/|title=Detroit police cracks down on citywide "paintball wars"|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=April 21, 2018|website=CBS News|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/27/detroit-police-crack-down-citywide-paintball-wars/560019002/|title=Detroit police to crack down on citywide 'paintball wars'|last1=Patterson|first1=Brandon|last2=Zaniewski|first2=Ann|date=April 27, 2018|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has been linked to several cases of property crime and homicide.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/01/paintball-wars-spate-shootings/569407002/|title=Paintball shootings splatter cities after rapper calls for swapping handguns for paintball weapons|last1=Mensch|first1=Jessica|last2=Luthern|first2=Ashley|date=May 1, 2018|website=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 Savage has not commented on the matter, although he paid for the funeral of a 3-year old who was killed in a related incident.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2" /&gt;

Controversy arose after Abraham-Joseph pulled out a firearm during a pool party on June 11, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8460380/21-savage-gun-atlanta-brawl|title=21 Savage Draws Gun During Atlanta Pool Party Brawl|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph was given the firearm by a friend after seeing an opposing crew member also pull out a pistol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/06/21-savage-pull-out-a-gun/|title=21 Savage Pulls Out A Gun During A Brawl: Watch|date=2018-06-10|work=Vibe|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
360 was born on 12 July 1986.&lt;ref name="APRADied"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) | title = 'Died This Way' at APRA search engine | url = http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Died%20This%20Way | accessdate = 1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; He attended [[Luther College (Victoria)|Luther College]] in Melbourne's eastern suburbs and graduated from [[Box Hill Senior Secondary College]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Music==

===2003-2006: Early Career===
360 made his first official appearance in 2003 on fellow Australian rapper Infallible's EP ''A Burning Ambition'', on the track "Situation Critical" along with MCs [[Hunter (rapper)|Hunter]] and Versa. The following year, he released his debut solo EP, titled ''Rarities'', in which three of its four tracks featured his rap partner and best friend [[Pez (musician)|Pez]].

In 2005, Pez and 360 released a song called "Nutcase", which 360 described as a "fuck around track [that was] written and recorded in one day. Trying to make you laugh, or cringe". 360 was featured on Sydney producers Weapon X and Ken Hell's 2006 mixtape ''Scar-Non III: Kick To The Head'' with the song "In Da Chub", a remix of [[50 Cent]]'s 2003 hit [[In da Club|"In Da Club"]].

===2007–2012: ''What You See Is What You Get'', ''Falling &amp; Flying''===
In February 2007, he signed to Soulmate Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soulmaterecords.wordpress.com/artists/ |title=Soulmate Records Artist Profiles |publisher=Soulmate Records |accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/02/04/360-signs-with-soulmate-records/ |title=360 signs with Soulmate Records |publisher=Ground Up Hip-Hop |date=4 February 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921181046/http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/02/04/360-signs-with-soulmate-records/ |archivedate=21 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He released his debut album, ''What You See Is What You Get'', on 22 March 2008. An ''InTheMix'' reviewer found 360 "not only showcases his hilariously funny comedic side but demonstrates his ability to approach more serious and personal issues, producing a well rounded album".&lt;ref name="InTheMix"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/melbourne/event/44096/360_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Get_Album_Launch | title = 360 ''What You See Is What You Get'' Album Launch | work = InTheMix | publisher = [[Sound Alliance]] | date = 12 April 2008 | accessdate = 2 December 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927015013/http://www.inthemix.com.au/whatson/melbourne/event/44096/360_What_You_See_Is_What_You_Get_Album_Launch | archive-date = 27 September 2013 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video interview for ''Peak Street Magazine'', 360 described his musical style as a combination of "some [[pop music|pop]] influences, [[electro (music)|electro]], [[dubstep]], and unintelligent rhymes".&lt;ref name=ps-video&gt;{{cite web | last=James | first=Sam | title=360 Interview with ''Peak Street'' | url=http://peakstreet.com/post/9094918957/360-vs-peak-street-interview | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130131061052/http://peakstreet.com/post/9094918957/360-vs-peak-street-interview | dead-url=yes | archive-date=31 January 2013 | work=Peak Street Magazine | accessdate=2 December 2012 | first2=Danny | last2=Haneman | first3=Aisha | last3=Glen | date=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2008, 360 released a music video of "Mamma Mia", which depicts his desire for [[Bec Hewitt]] and mocked her husband, [[Lleyton Hewitt]], which was the Video of the Week on MySpace.com's Australian hip hop page.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/song-slams-trophy-wife-bec/story-e6frf96x-1111115315578 | title=Rapper 360 makes Bec Hewitt lustful object of lyrics | publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]] ([[News Corporation]]) |work=[[Herald Sun]] | date=14 January 2008 | accessdate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/rapper-360-targets-bec-and-lleyton-hewitt-in-myspace-video/story-e6frewyr-1111115314399 | title=Rapper 360 targets Bec and Lleyton Hewitt in MySpace video | date=14 January 2008 | publisher=[[News Limited]] ([[News Corporation]]) | work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=27 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 described it as a comedic effort, "I wanted to take the piss out of them ... It's not meant to be taken too seriously she's not really my type". Management for the couple dismissed the rapper's effort as "a publicity stunt".&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

By March 2010, he remained signed with Soulmate Records, which had signed a distribution deal with [[EMI Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soulmaterecords.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/soulmate-records-x-emi-partnership// |title=Soulmate Records partners with EMI |publisher=Soulmate Records | date=15 March 2010 | accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, his single, "Just Got Started" (featuring [[Pez (musician)|Pez]]), was released.&lt;ref name="iTunes10"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/just-got-started-feat.-pez/id406702982 | title = 'Just Got Started' (feat.

360's second album, ''[[Falling &amp; Flying]]'', was released on 30 September 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2011/01/13/144105_entertainment.html|title=360 is flying and falling...|publisher=[[The Cairns Post]]|date=13 January 2011|last=Kuch|first=Jesse|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reached No.&amp;nbsp;4 on the ARIA Albums Chart,&lt;ref name="AusCharts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=360 | title = Discography 360 | publisher = Australian Charts Portal.

By October 2012, ''Falling &amp; Flying'' was certified platinum by ARIA for shipments of 70,000 units,&lt;ref name="ARIA Alb Cert 2012"&gt;{{Cite certification|region=Australia|type=album|certyear=2012| accessdate = 2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was certified double platinum by July 2014.&lt;ref name="Jam"&gt;{{cite web|author1=James Jennings|title=360: Alive and Kicking|url=http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/360-alive-and-kicking|website=Rolling Stone Australia|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=2 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021113403/http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/360-alive-and-kicking|archive-date=21 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the fourth single from the album, "Boys like You" (featuring Gossling), was released, which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;3 on the Australian singles chart in February 2012.&lt;ref name="AusCharts"/&gt; The track also reached the top&amp;nbsp;40 of the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="NZCharts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://charts.org.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=360 | title = Discography 360 | publisher = New Zealand Charts Portal.

The national Australian "Flying Tour" occurred in support of the album, and 360 was supported by new Melbourne artist Bam Bam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bam Bam|url=https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/bam-bam|website=triple j Unearthed|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–present: ''Utopia'' &amp; ''Vintage Modern''===
In June 2012, 360 revealed to national youth broadcaster [[Triple J]] that he was already working on his third album, describing the upcoming release as "quite a dark album". He described it further, "No one sees behind the scenes and there's been a lot of bad (expletive) going on in my family life and personal life". 360 hinted at a diverse production line-up for the album, saying he has "been getting a gang of beats from all different people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 readies "dark" new album|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3518538.htm|website=triple j|publisher=ABC|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video, published on 21 November 2013, served as the official press release for the launch of Forthwrite Records, a music label created by 360 and Pez. 360 then confirmed the announcement on his Facebook page the following day, stating that the label will release ''Don't Look Down'', by Pez, ''[[Utopia (360 album)|Utopia]]'', by 360, and the debut, yet untitled Forthwrite album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=360|title=22 November 2013|url=https://en-gb.facebook.com/3ree6ixty/posts/10153511253795367|website=360 on Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORTHWRITE RECORDS Media Release 21 Nov 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRkQ8OvXr3A|website=FORTHWRITE on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his performance at the 2013 Sprung Hip Hop Festival, held in [[Brisbane]], Australia, 360 garnered media attention for the manner in which he introduced a new song titled "On A Planet No One Knows". According to 360, the song, which also features a vocal sample from [[Joss Whedon]] regarding gender equality, is "about racism in Australia."&lt;ref name="Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=WATCH: 360 – 'On A Planet No One Knows’|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/tv/watch-360-on-a-planet-no-one-knows/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 exclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There's a lot of racist cunts in this country [Australia]. I don't know if people are proud to admit it, or what—but there is. No matter what colour or background we are, there are fuckheads in every single race. Generalising everyone is fucking ignorant and uneducated and stupid. If you're offended by this then you're probably fuckin' racist and you should fuck off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mike Hohnen|title=360 Calls Out Racist Australia During New Song At Sprung Hip Hop Festival|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/360-calls-out-racist-australia-during-new-song-at-sprung-hip-hop-festival/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2014, 360 supported the Australian tour of American rapper [[Eminem]], alongside [[Kendrick Lamar]]. 360 described the tour as a career highlight and explained to the media in January 2014 that it would be his first tour sober—he had previously struggled with drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lisa Visentin|title=360 announces tour of Australia|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/360-announces-tour-of-australia-20140527-zrpdp.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the release of the artist's third album, ''Utopia'', on 13 June 2014, three singles were released: "Impossible", "On A Planet No One Knows" and "Sixavelli". "Impossible" is a collaboration with [[Daniel Johns]], of Australian band [[Silverchair]], and Johns also appears in the music video, in which he is a passenger in a car driven by 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - Impossible (Ft Daniel Johns) Official Video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU78NDpJt08|website=3ree6ixty on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=20 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A music video was also released for the second single and was published on the artist's YouTube channel during the week before [[Australia Day]].&lt;ref name="Plan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - ON A PLANET NO ONE KNOWS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUWJZSbGF7s|website=3ree6ixty on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=20 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for "Sixavelli" was directed by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and was published in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=360 - Sixavelli (Feat.

Alongside fellow Australian hip hop act [[Hilltop Hoods]], 360 performed at the 2014 [[Splendour In The Grass]] festival, held in [[Byron Bay]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Splendour In The Grass 2014 lineup|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3990250.htm|website=triple j|publisher=ABC|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian "Utopia Tour" occurred during September 2014 and 360 was supported by US rapper Hopsin, UK artist Lunar C, Pez and Miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jed Ahern|title=360 ANNOUNCES UTOPIA TOUR SUPPORT ACTS|url=http://www.vmusic.com.au/news/360-announces-utopia-tour-support-acts.aspx|website=V Music|publisher=Foxtel Management Pty Ltd|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923110500/http://www.vmusic.com.au/news/360-announces-utopia-tour-support-acts.aspx|archive-date=23 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
During the early years of his music career, 360 collaborated with Pez as part of a duo called "Forthwrite",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForthWrite - 'Guilty Conscience'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDxVFtjCxyI|website=PEZ on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a track called "The Club Song" on the 2010 album ''[[Good Gracious]]'', by producer [[M-Phazes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Gracious M-Phazes|url=https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/good-gracious/id359623656|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 also featured on Pez's 2008 single, "The Festival Song", which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;14 on the ARIA Australian Singles Chart.&lt;ref name="The ARIA Report – 12 Jan 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20090120-0000/issue985.pdf | title = ARIA Report – 12th Jan 2009 | publisher = Australian Recording Industry Association | issue = 985 | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | date = 12 January 2009 | accessdate = 2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 360 started an online musical project in the Australian hip hop scene, called "Rapper Tag", on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappertag.com:80/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712043422/http://www.rappertag.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Rapper Tag |publisher=360 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper Tag involves one person recording a portion of rap over a looped beat, and then nominating ("tagging") another person to add further rapping over the same loop. The process continued in accordance with the nomination of the next rapper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s3076379.htm |title=Triple J: 360 Rapper Tag Phenomenon |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.optimising.com.au/blog/interview-on-social-media-with-melbourne-rapper-360/|date=9 March 2011|author=Daniel  |title=Interview on Social Media with Melbourne Rapper 360 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian hip hop duo [[Diafrix]] collaborated with 360 for the song "I'm A Dreamer", which appears on the 2012 album ''Pocket Full Of Dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diafrix feat. 360 - I'm A Dreamer (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTRCDRkz34|website=diafrix lion on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|format=Video upload|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 appeared on the self-titled debut album by Canberra producer, Ghosts in the Room, released on 14 September 2012 through Mudd Music. The album also features rappers Iron Solomon, Okwerdz and Kool G Rap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghosts in the Room Ghosts in the Room|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/ghosts-in-the-room/id537506609|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media appearances==
360 was a panel member for the 20 October 2014 edition of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) program ''[[Q&amp;A (Australian talk show)|Q&amp;A]]''. He appeared alongside [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]], a particle physicist, [[Richard Gill (conductor)|Richard Gill]], renowned conductor, and [[Nalini Joshi]], a notable Australian mathematician, to discuss the topic of "passion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=gregmoskovitch|title=Get The Popcorn, 360 Is A Panelist On Next Monday's Q&amp;A|url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/421594/360-will-appear-next-mondays-qa.htm|website=Tone Deaf|publisher=Tone Deaf|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 360 garnered media attention for his comments on the television program regarding racism in relation to Australia, Australian hip hop and the Australian flag. When questioned by the presenter, 360 replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Australia Day, you see dudes walking around with their tops off, and they're getting on the drink and all that. And they've got an Australian flag wrapped around their neck. I've seen it so many times; like, I've been in a taxi where we've pulled up because these dickheads have been walking across the road—they just start yelling at the taxi driver, like: "Get out of the country! This is not your country!" ... And they're wearing Australian flags. I've seen it so much, like, growing up ... still today, you know what I mean?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian flag represents racism: 360|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dndT4vq5CpE|website=ABC News (Australia) on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=21 October 2014|format=Video upload|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This response caused controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=#BBCTrending: Has Australia's flag been co-opted by racists?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-29712614|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the transference of the media spotlight onto Pez, who made comments on social media following 360's appearance. In addition to a message of support for his friend and musical collaborator, Pez also wrote that he also "got a bit offended"; however, he subsequently removed the sentence "To be honest, even I got a bit offended." from his original Facebook post. As of 24 October 2014, 360 had not retracted his ''Q&amp;A'' comments and explained after the airing of the episode: "If you are not racist then you have nothing to be offended about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nastassia Baroni|title=Pez Admits To Being "Offended" By 360's 'Q&amp;A' Comments|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/pez-admits-to-being-offended-by-360s-qa-comments/|website=Music Feeds|publisher=Music Feeds|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{outdated section|date=September 2016}}
At the age of 18 years, 360 contracted a disease of his right eye, a [[cornea transplant]], which "left him with fuzzy vision" in that eye.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt; A July 2014 feature article in ''Rolling Stone Australia'' stated that he is "legally blind in his right eye", while his left eye is "slowly deteriorating due to the degenerative eye disease Keratoconus".&lt;ref name="Jam" /&gt;

On 18 July 2010, 360 was involved in a [[go-kart]]ing accident while celebrating his birthday with Sydney-based hip hop artists [[Bliss n Eso]]. He suffered a torn [[artery]], lacerated [[pancreas]] and a damaged [[scrotum]].&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cameron|title=Accident brings 360 perspective|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/accident-brings-360-perspective/story-e6frfn09-1226152049520|work=news.com.au| publisher = News Limited (News Corporation) | date = 29 September 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rapper, "It [scrotum] wasn't ruptured, but it was ripped open ... The first thing I checked once I woke up was I didn't need to use a colostomy bag. My sex life is intact. There's no sex appeal if you use a colostomy bag".&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

360 and Bale promoted awareness of suicide and depression issues. In mid-February 2012, he posted a video clip with the following statement: "I don't usually drop serious videos, but this is something I'm passionate about spreading awareness about. Even if you hate me, this has nothing to do with music—please share this around so as many people as possible can see it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapper 360 Speaks Out About Suicide |url=http://www.take40.com/artists/5752/360/news/29226/watch:-rapper-360-speaks-out-about-suicide |work=take40.com |accessdate=1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Bale posted her video, 'A Message from Crystal', which Beats Factory{{'}}s Robyn Morrison described as footage of Bale "talking about how she has been affected by suicide—multiple times ...

On 8 January 2016, 360 posted a song named ''I'm Sorry'' onto his [[Facebook]] page. It talked about his [[codeine]] addiction. His addiction resulted in him cancelling tours without notice. In the song 360 mentions how he didn't tell anyone because he felt like a burden.

'''Justin David Blau''' (born January 9, 1991),&lt;ref name="ablau"/&gt; better known by his stage name '''3LAU''' (pronounced "Blau"),&lt;ref name="gblau"/&gt; is an American DJ and [[electronic dance music]] producer. Based in [[Las Vegas]], he has released three mixtapes since 2011 and several singles, and has performed at festivals such as [[Electric Zoo]] in New York and EDC Vegas.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; In 2014 he released the track "Vikings" with Botnek on [[Dim Mak Records]].&lt;ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/&gt;

==Early life==
Justin David Blau was born in [[Syosset]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States on {{birth date and age|1991|01|09}}.&lt;ref name="ablau"/&gt; Blau grew up around an artistic family, and was soon playing piano, playing guitar and singing. At thirteen, he moved with his family to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he spent the rest of his youth.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; He attended [[The Meadows School]] for high school and [[Washington University in St. Louis]] for college.&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt;

== Background ==
Much of 3LAU's music incorporates [[electro house]], [[dubstep]], [[deep house]], and [[progressive house]].&lt;ref name="dblau" /&gt; He is known for his melodic take on dance music and live sets that incorporate [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. He is also known for using [[Ableton]].

==Music career==

===2011–12: First releases===
In 2011, at the age of 20, he vacationed in Sweden, where he discovered electronic dance music. After returning to college he started producing mashups, "mainly because [he] didn't think anyone was doing a good job."&lt;ref name="cblau"/&gt; He soon began mixing under the professional name 3LAU, and by June of that year was uploading mashups to YouTube.&lt;ref name="jblauallmusicbio"/&gt;

3LAU gained recognition in the [[electronic music]] world in 2011 with his two bootlegs, "Girls Who Save the World" and "All Night Long". He also won a remix competition for his remix of [[Tiesto]]'s "Work Hard, Play Hard".

Before 2012, 3LAU spent his days studying at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and DJing at night. He has had remixes charts in the top 10 on both [[Beatport]] and [[Hype Machine]].&lt;ref name="dblau"/&gt;

===2012–15: Singles, touring===
In 2012, he focused on DJing and launched his 3LAU Your Mind tour. That same year, he released his second bootleg album, ''Dance Floor Filth''.&lt;ref name="dblau"/&gt; In 2012, the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' described him as "one of America's fastest-rising DJ-producers."&lt;ref name="bblau"/&gt; In 2012 he released ''Dance Floor Filth 2'', an album featuring his production.&lt;ref name="iblau"/&gt;

In late 2013, he went on a short tour with Carnage called the Night Riot tour.&lt;ref name="eblauboston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hblau"/&gt; Wrote Jonah Ollman of ''Sound of Boston'' about 3LAU's live performances in late 2013, "A nice balance of mashups, electro-house, poppy vocal samples, and a 90’s throwback here and there keep the young 20-something crowd going and constantly entertained."&lt;ref name="eblauboston"/&gt;

In the summer of 2015, 3LAU did his first European tour visiting Barcelona, Germany and Ibiza. Later that fall, he went on his first Asian tour which included Bangkok, Jakarta, Tokyo and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tour|url = http://www.3lau.com/tour|website = Tour|access-date = 2016-01-11|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160117071736/http://www.3lau.com/tour|archive-date = 2016-01-17|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''442oons''' is an English [[YouTube]] [[animation]] [[parody]] channel set up in 2013. The channel focuses on animated [[association football]] parodies, such as [[Premier League]], [[La Liga]] and [[Bundesliga]] matches. He now works with Bundesliga to make weekly videos on the channel.

==Career==
The channels' creator, Dean Stobbart, originally a teacher from [[Norton, County Durham]], had in the past been a part-time voice actor, along with being a professional actor starring in productions on the West End including Our House (musical) and also did some animation for his lessons. He said he saw a gap in the market that "no one had really done football cartoons before", so he used CrazyTalk (Animator software) to make his first animated video, a parody of [[Luis Suárez]] and former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Arsène Wenger]] in a cartoon parody of a scene from [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|''The Silence of the Lambs'']]. The video currently has 2.312 million views and was followed up with another Suárez-themed video which has received more than fourteen million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLhUgkO7Zxg|title=😁LUIS SUAREZ BITE😁 by 442oons (Suarez Evra Ivanovic football cartoon) Seven Sins of Suarez|last=|first=|date=2018-08-24|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has worked with organisations such as ''[[TalkSport]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talksport.com/football/best-football-april-fool-them-all-442oons-sends-bayern-munich-stars-150401141853|title=The best football April Fool of them all? 442oons sends up Bayern Munich stars|first=|last=talkSPORT|date=1 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talksport.com/football/mourinho-v-sterling-video-footage-you-didnt-see-liverpool-v-chelsea-150121133222|title=Mourinho v Sterling: The video footage YOU DIDN'T SEE from Liverpool v Chelsea!|first=Craig|last=Bloomfield|date=21 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[SkySports]]'' on animations.

In July 2017, he created a new YouTube channel parodying the celebrity world called Celebri2oons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Channel|https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4m9rhlOV1VCFbqZJXpVcFw|Celebri2oons}} on YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 30th May 2018. Online Soccer Manager (OSM) became an official 442oons mobile game.

'''A.D.O.R.''', born '''Eddie Castellanos''', is a U.S. hip hop artist whose work includes the [[Pete Rock]]-produced hit "Let It All Hang Out" ([[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], 1992), and "One for the Trouble" (Atlantic, 1994), produced by [[Marley Marl]]. The latter has been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] extensively in later songs, most famously [[Fatboy Slim]]'s 1998 remix of "Renegade Master" by [[Roger McKenzie|Roger "Wildchild" MacKenzie]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Castellanos was born in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights, New York City]]. His father was a musician by profession, and as a child Castellanos attended his shows. At six years of age he moved with his family to [[Mount Vernon, New York]], later to be known in hip hop circles as "money earnin' Mount Vernon" due to the preponderance of rap stars it produced.The future A.D.O.R. went to high school there, where he met [[Sean Combs]], [[Heavy D]], Al B. Sure, and [[Pete Rock]]. Becoming interested in hip hop, he took the name A.D.O.R. (standing for both Another Dimension of Rhythm and A Declaration Of A Revolution). Sean Combs, by this time working at [[Uptown Records]], began presenting A.D.O.R.'s demo tapes to record companies. Heavy D's DJ, DJ Eddie F, secured him a management and production deal. In 1992 he recorded his first record, the single "Let It All Hang Out", for [[Atlantic Records]].&lt;ref name=am1/&gt;

==="Let It All Hang Out"===
The musical backing for A.D.O.R.'s raps on "Let It All Hang Out" was by his old friend Pete Rock, by 1992 already an acclaimed producer, and now commonly cited as one of the hip hop genre's best. Stanton Swihart of [[allmusic]] describes the track as an "infectious" outing that was an "instant classic" on release, driven by Rock's "irresistible horn loop" and the "tight flow" of A.D.O.R.'s rhymes. A hit in the summer of 1992, for Swihart its qualities have now proved timeless.&lt;ref name=am1&gt;Stanton Swihart. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:difyxqlhldke~T1 A.D.O.R. Biography]", allmusic, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=am2&gt;Stanton Swihart. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gbfpxqwjldse A.D.O.R.: Shock Therapy]", allmusic, undated.&lt;/ref&gt; HipHopDX calls "Let It All Hang Out" "a certifiable Pete Rock classic", with "delicious horns" that no other producer could emulate.&lt;ref name=dx&gt;J-22. "[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.370 A.D.O.R. - Classic Bangerz]", hiphopdx, January 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Though most critical commentary focuses on the production, the rapper's contribution is roundly praised; Steve Juon of RapReviews notes in particular that the record established A.D.O.R.'s distinctive, high-pitched register.&lt;ref name=juon&gt;Steve Juon. "[http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2003_12_bangerzv1.html A.D.O.R. :: Classic Bangerz Volume 1 :: Tru Reign Records ] rapreviews, December 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="One for the Trouble" and ''The Concrete''===
A.D.O.R. toured with major acts and made television appearances building on the buzz created by "Let It All Hang Out". In 1994 he followed up with a second single, "One for the Trouble", produced by K-Def and the legendary Queensbridge producer [[Marley Marl]]. This record provided the "back once again with the ill behaviour" vocal snippet which dominates [[Fatboy Slim]]'s 1998 hit remix of "Renegade Master" by [[Roger McKenzie|Wildchild]]. "One for the Trouble" signaled  that plans were underway for a debut album on Atlantic titled ''The Concrete''. Despite his successful run at the major label, A.D.O.R. was let go from his contract with Atlantic in 1995 without ''The Concrete'' being released, reportedly because of disputes over creative decisions, even though promotional items were released and the catalogue number 82443 was assigned to the release.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;Gabrielle Schafer. "[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ador/articles/story/5927916/tru_reign_signs_deal_with_sumthing_distribution Tru Reign Signs Deal With Sumthing Distribution ]", ''Rolling Stone'', January 6, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tru Reign: ''Shock Therapy''===
A.D.O.R. formed his own record company in 1996: Tru Reign Records. For his fledgling label he immediately recorded and released as a single another Pete Rock track, "Enter the Center". It was a successful venture. Stanton reports that it sold "remarkably well" given its independent, small scale distribution, and received heavy radio play.&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; He considers it the equal of its predecessor "Let It All Hang Out", but Juon goes further, offering that both Rock and Castellanos had improved their respective techniques in the six years between the two tracks. He draws attention to a new-found depth in the lyrical content of A.D.O.R.'s rap, putting this advancement down to maturity and experience in the later record.&lt;ref name=juon/&gt; HipHopDX's reviewer found in "Enter the Center" "more of Pete Rock's understated brilliance".&lt;ref name=dx/&gt; A.D.O.R.'s singles to date were collected on his debut album for Tru Reign, ''Shock Frequency'' (1998). Rock and Marley Marl were joined there by [[Diamond D]] and [[DJ Clark Kent|Clark Kent]], making an impressive roster. "Shock to Bliss" and "Shock Frequency" were reminiscent of Rock's cuts, and almost as good, and Kent's contribution "From the Concrete" completed the album's highlights. The record as a whole betrayed its 1992 roots, though reviewers found this was not a bad thing, even if it did mean that it seemed to lack relevance or urgency in the musical climate of 1998.&lt;ref name=am2/&gt;

===''Classic Bangerz'', ''The Signature of the Ill'', and beyond===
In January 2000, Tru Reign secured a distribution deal with [[Nile Rodgers]]' company Sumpthing Distribution. By this time, A.D.O.R.'s roster at Tru Reign also included artists K The Terrorbull, Nappy Redd &amp; Filthy Rich, and Cristal Lane.&lt;ref name=stone/&gt; A.D.O.R. released the album ''Animal 2000'' in this year. All was quiet until 2003, when he reemerged with the compilation ''Classic Bangers, Vol. 1'', and then an album of new music, ''Signature of the Ill'', in 2005. Both were received favorably by critics, yet the praise was again qualified as it had been with ''Shock Frequency''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s reception: the compilation of old material (which mined ''Shock Frequency'' heavily) ''and'' the collection of new music both seemed throwbacks to simpler times, with lyrics that concentrated on fun and a smooth flow rather than the trickery and internal or polysyllabic rhyme schemes of virtuoso rappers following in the wake of [[Biggie]] or [[Big Pun|Pun]].&lt;ref name=dx/&gt;&lt;ref name=juon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Teufel . "
For the song, Step Up. Castellanos hired Producer and Director Ronald Farnham to make the music video, which was shot in Tampa, Florida.

'''A1one''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|'|l|oʊ|n}}) ({{lang-fa|تنها}}) is the pseudonym of '''Karan Reshad,''' an Iranian [[Visual arts|visual artist]] who pioneered [[graffiti]] and [[street art]] in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="fatcap"&gt;{{cite web|title=An introduction to graffiti and street art from Tehran through A1one a graffiti pioneer in his country|url=http://www.fatcap.com/article/iranian-graffiti.html|accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career as a street artist began in his hometown, [[Tehran]].

== Life and career ==
A1one grew up in Iran during a period of war and the Khatami reform era (1997-2005). A1one studied for 5 years at the Art and architecture university in Tehran. While still a student, he began using graffiti around the university campus, as a protest against student conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  He was eventually expelled by the School's President following a disagreement over artistic restrictions. &lt;ref name="artcat"&gt;[http://zine.artcat.com/2008/07/interview.php Rebel Without a Crew: Street Artist A1one in Tehran], ''Artcat.com'', 21 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After being expelled from University, his graffiti activities in the city of [[Tehran]] increased. A1one was the first person to start painting on the city walls. His name can be interpreted as "Alone" or "First One." &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S., ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; A1one started painting walls in the late 1990s. He is the pioneer of the urban art scene in [[Middle East]]. When he began, it was a time when nobody knew what graffiti was in his country. He had a very influential role in the rise of street art and stenciling within Iran.&lt;ref name=theage&gt;{{cite news|title=Graffiti cops a spray|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/07/31/1217097393985.html|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=8 April 2015|last=Scott-Norman|first=Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialactive.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/graffitti-in-teheran-instigating-political-change/ Graffitti&lt;!--sic--&gt; in Tehran: Instigating Political Change], ''Socialactive.wordpress.com'', 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Already involved in urban arts in general, he met in 2005 the rapper Nima who told him everything about the graffiti culture which triggered A1one's desire to grow in that direction. His first significant work was a painting under the Tehran-Karaj expressway called ''Searching for Friends''.&lt;ref name="A1one first"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran], ''Pingmap.jp'', 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his street art project in 2003 and inspired his close friends at that time to also begin painting on the streets. Artists such as Elle, isba, K.T. and Magoi were the first people to join him in Tehran. With his public space art, he describes his view on the Iranian society and puts himself regularly in danger.&lt;ref name="A1one first"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I decided to do my painting on walls I bought some spray cans - at that time we had just some very low quality colors in Iran. My first work was a very simple work titled “searching for friends” painted on a wall right next to the Tehran-Karaj expressway late at night. It was a really frightening night for me… The next morning I got three calls from friends who recognized my style of painting. They were shocked to see my work on a public wall. My first stencil was a [[Edvard Munch|Munch's]] [[The Scream|Scream]] Print on Art University walls and after that , experimented with many techniques and methods, but I continue with stencils, graffiti and [[sticker art]]."&lt;ref name=pingmag&gt;{{cite web|title=A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran |url=http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |archivedate=12 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, he was invited to illustrate the cover of a book, ''Young and Defiant in Iran''; a contempary ethnographic work by Shahram Khosravi. &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he was invited to show his work at the annual Melbourne Stencil Festival, taking 40 pieces of work with him to his first trip in a non-dictatorship country, thus experimenting exhibiting his artwork without the fear of reprisals for the first time.&lt;ref name=theage/&gt;

By 2010, A1One was an established name within Tehran's youth culture and a key figure in the emergence of Iranian street art. &lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S., "Graffiti in Tehran," ''Anthropology Now,'' Vol. 5, No. 1, 2013, pp 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Tehranurbanartalone.jpg|thumb|A1one Spray painted wall in Tehran 2006 ]]
A1one's art world is dynamic and made of many different styles, from portraits to calligraphy and funky characters which he mostly uses for his stickers. A1one's art combines [[Persian calligraphy]] and Western [[graffiti]]. His art has been documented by many photographers and featured in [[Art Asia Pacific]] Magazine.

The artist has been working on a distinctly Iranian style of calligraffiti, which is "a fusion of hip-hop graffiti and Persian typography."&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, S, m ''Precarious Lives: Waiting and Hope in Iran,'' University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; His style is recognised across the [[Islamic graffiti]] world. He has made a handful of the greatest Style walls with Arabic letter graffiti since 2004.&lt;ref name=fatcap2&gt;{{cite news|title=Le graffiti compte déjà de nombreuses formes.

==Arrests==
He has been arrested several times and signed agreements with police not to work in streets.He attacked Iranian Artist Forum with His paintings, while The management of the Iranian artists forum did not understand his aim and stopped him and called the police.
In 2012 A1one was kidnapped by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)]], under the charge of social and political reasons and was held in [[Evin Prison]] for 10 days at Ward 209.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Antonio M. Alvarez III''' (born 30 March 1966), also known by his stage name '''A3''', is a singer-songwriter and businessman.&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.johnson.cornell.edu/alumni/enterprise/fall2013/index.cfm?action=inside&amp;inside_id=26&amp;alum=17 |title=Paying It Forward: Antonio M. Alvarez III, MBA ’91 |date=July 2013|author= Irene Kim |work= |publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He achieved success with top singles on the UK charts including "Feel The Light", "Come with Me", "Dance Till Dawn"&lt;ref name="kingsofspins.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kingsofspins.com/page/a3-dancing_till_the_dawn-wonderfly_music_progressive_house|title=Kings of Spins A3 - Dancing Till The Dawn -...|website=www.kingsofspins.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;” and "Before the Snow". His tracks have been remixed by many notable DJs such as [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]], [[Moto Blanco]], and others, and his music has topped dance charts in Europe. He was voted No. 8 as one of the best new artists by Music Week Dance Chart Top 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.musicweek.com/music-week-presents/read/music-week-presents-a3/068055|title=Music Week Presents: A3|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==

A3 was born in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. He then moved to the [[United States]] and grew up in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Staten Island]], New York. He attended [[Université Catholique de l'Ouest]] in France and the [[Université de Louvain La Neuve]] in Belgium, and received a BA from [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame University]], and also an MBA from [[Cornell University]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="cornell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; He has a multicultural background of [[Spaniards|Spanish]], [[Filipinos|Filipino]], American and European/French. Alvarez moved from New York City to London in 2002.

==Career==

===Music===
A3 began his musical career in 2009 when he was discovered by an agent for [[Viva Records (Philippines)|Viva Records]] singing at his brother's wedding in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. In 2010, he landed the theme song for Rubi Telenovela in the Philippines and was signed by music label Viva Music shortly after. His first Album “100% Heart” rose to number two on the Filipino Pop charts behind the lead single “Wish”, the duet he recorded with [[Sarah Geronimo]] and which was the revival of the Donna Cruz and Jason Everly original hit.

A chance meeting in [[London]] put A3 on his current path into the EDM and dance world when he was introduced to the [[The Black Eyed Peas|Black Eyed Peas]] team at the “We Can Be Anything” campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2147117/Will-attends-bandmate-apl-aps-We-Can-Be-Anything-Charity-Gala-campaign.html|title=He remembers his friends! Will.i.am attends Black Eyed Peas bandmate Apl.de.ap's charity campaign|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Black Eyed Peas member [[Apl.de.ap|Apl.de.Ap]]. and connected with music producer DJ Poet Named Life. They began working together immediately after a 12-hour flight from Europe to LA and co-wrote and produced A3's breakout single “Feel the Light”, which went to number 8 on Music Week Charts and got UK Club and radio play.

===Business===
A3 is also known in the world of business as Antonio "Tony" Alvarez III. He is the managing director of [[Alvarez &amp; Marsal]], a firm his father, Antonio Alvarez II, co-founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alvarezandmarsal.co.uk/our-people/antonio-alvarez-iii-tony-iii|title=Antonio Alvarez III ("Tony III")|website=Alvarez &amp; Marsal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=7282496&amp;privcapId=5491790 |title=Antonio M. Alvarez III |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

A3's music is primarily dance and EDM and inspired by his life, it's ups and downs and his personal relationships. His key themes have included learning through love, unity, light/positivity, and redemption/second chances.

A3 has cited being influenced by many genres and sounds and his music is a convergence of those influences. His beats and EDM/dance echoes aspects of nostalgic new wave sounds from [[New Order (band)|New Order]], OMD and [[Depeche Mode]], in a modernized and soulful interpretation. He is also very influenced by pop singers and songwriters, whose songs focus on deep personal emotions such as [[George Micheal]], [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]] and more.

==Personal life==

A3 is married to Paris-based Ukrainian fashion model Olena Labunets. They have one son together, Alexandre "Sasha" Alvarez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.story.hr/celebrity/o-njezinom-suprugu-hrvatska-bruji-vec-danima-360210 |title=O njezinom suprugu Hrvatska bruji već danima! |date=3 April 2017|work=Story }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has four children from a first marriage: Anthony Alvarez IV, creator of the clothing brand One-Culture, which was started in [[Le Marais|Le Marais, Paris]], Anatole Alvarez, Victor Alvarez, and Camille Alvarez. He currently lives between the UK, [[France]], and the US.

'''Animat''' (''third-person indicative present of the [[Latin]] verb '''animō'''''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/go.php?D1=9&amp;H1=109&amp;T1=animo "Animo" at Verbix Latin Verb Conjugator]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning to "animate, give or bring life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/animo "Animo" at Latdict Latin Dictionary and Grammar Resources]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animats''' are artificial [[animal]]s, a contraction of [[animal]]-materials. The term includes physical robots and virtual simulations.  Animat research, a subset of [[Artificial Life]] studies, has become rather popular since [[Rodney Brooks]]' seminal paper "Intelligence without representation". The word was coined by S.W. Wilson in 1985,
in "Knowledge growth in an artificial animal", published in the first ''Proceedings'' 
''of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications''.

An example using the Animat model as proposed by Wilson is discussed at some length in chapter 9 of [[Stan Franklin]]'s book, [[Artificial Minds]]. In this implementation, the animat is capable of independent learning about its environment through application and evolution of pattern-matching rules called "taxons".

In 2001 Thomas DeMarse performed studies on '[[neurally controlled animat]]'.  Every two years, the Society of Adaptive Behaviour meets and produces a proceedings on this topic.  They also have a journal, ''[[Adaptive Behavior]]''.

[[Alan H Goldstein]] has proposed that, because [[nanobiotechnology]] is in the process of creating real animal-materials, speculative use of this term should be discouraged and its application become purely phenomenological.  Based on the Animat Test (contained in the reference  "I, Nanobot.") any nonbiological material or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life form is, de facto, an Animat.  Goldstein's basic premise is that in the age of nanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular engineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum level of 'intelligence' such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive phenomena.   Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between the fields of nanobiotechnology and A-life based on profound differences in scientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology (jargon) these two fields have produced.  Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular engineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are generally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building molecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. neuroelectronic splices.  A-Life researchers mainly take a systems-level approach.  The enormous transformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create Animats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would not fit into most standard A-Life paradigms.  As a result, Goldstein argues, the first Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific community.

[[File:Chimp Brain in a jar.jpg|thumb|right|This old jar containing a chimpanzee brain is currently preserved in the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum of London]]. It is still labeled ''Anthropopithecus troglodytes'', [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] replaced in 1895 by ''[[Common chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes]]''.]]
The terms '''''Anthropopithecus''''' ([[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|Blainville]], 1839) and '''''Pithecanthropus''''' ([[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1868) are obsolete taxa describing either [[chimpanzee]]s or [[archaic humans]]. Both are derived from Greek  ἄνθρωπος (anthropos, "man") and πίθηκος (píthēkos, "ape" or "monkey"), translating to "man-ape" and "ape-man", respectively.

''Anthropopithecus'' was originally coined to describe the [[chimpanzee]] and is now a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] of ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]''. It had been also used to describe several other extant and extinct species, among others the fossil [[Java Man]]. Very quickly, the latter was re-assigned to ''Pithecanthropus'', originally coined to refer to a theoretical "[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]". ''Pithecanthropus'' is now classed as ''[[Homo erectus]]'', thus a junior synonym of ''[[Homo]]''.

== History ==
The [[genus]] ''Anthropopithecus'' was first proposed in 1839 by the French [[Zoology|zoologist]] and [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|Henri-Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]] (1777–1850) in order to give a genus name to some [[chimpanzee]] material that he was studying at the time.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"&gt;Bernard Wood ''et alii'', ''Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Human Evolution'', June 2013 (single-volume paperback version of the original 2011 2-volume edition), 1056 pp.; {{ISBN|978-1-1186-5099-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' was established by De Blainville in 1839, the British [[surgeon]] and [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[John Bland-Sutton]] (1855–1936) proposed the [[species]] name ''Anthropopithecus troglodytes'' in 1883 to designate the [[common chimpanzee]]. However, the genus ''Pan'' had already been attributed to chimpanzees in 1816 by the German naturalist [[Lorenz Oken]] (1779–1851). Since any earlier [[Binomial nomenclature|nomenclature]] prevails over subsequent nomenclatures, the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' definitely lost its validity in 1895,&lt;ref name="Tubbs"&gt;P. K. Tubbs, "Opinion 1368 The generic names ''Pan'' and ''Panthera'' (Mammalia, Carnivora): available as from Oken, 1816", ''Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature'' (1985), volume 42, pp 365-370&lt;/ref&gt; becoming from that date a [[junior synonym]] of the genus ''Pan''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to the current international consensus, the genus ''Pan'' includes two [[species]]: the common chimpanzee (''[[Common chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes]]'') and the bonobo or dwarf chimpanzee (''[[Bonobo|Pan paniscus]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879,&lt;ref&gt;''Pôle international de la Préhistoire'' "[http://www.pole-prehistoire.com/index.php/fr/decouvrir/les-ressources-en-ligne/espace-documentation/86-bibliotheque-numerique/148-le-prehistorique-antiquite-de-l-homme-gabriel-de-mortillet ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l'homme'' / Gabriel de Mortillet]" {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|Gabriel de Mortillet]] (1821–1898) proposed the term ''Anthropopithecus'' to designate a "[[Transitional fossil|missing link]]", a hypothetical intermediate between ape and man that lived in the [[Tertiary]] and that supposedly, following De Mortillet's theory, produced [[eolith]]s.&lt;ref name="Mortillet"&gt;[[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|Gabriel de Mortillet]], ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''homme'', Bibliothèque des sciences contemporaines, 2nd edition, Paris, C. Reinwald, 1885, 642 p. {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work of 1883 ''Le Préhistorique, antiquité de l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;homme'' (''The Prehistoric: Man's Antiquity'', below quoted after the 2nd edition, 1885&lt;ref name="Mortillet"/&gt;), De Mortillet writes:

{{quote|''Nous sommes donc forcément conduits à admettre, par une déduction logique tirée de l’observation directe des faits, que les animaux intelligents qui savaient faire du feu et tailler des pierres à l’époque tertiaire, n’étaient pas des hommes dans l’acception géologique et paléontologique du mot, mais des animaux d’un autre genre, des précurseurs de l’homme dans l’échelle des êtres, précurseurs auxquels j’ai donné le nom d’Anthropopithecus. Ainsi, par le seul raisonnement, solidement appuyé sur des observations précises, nous sommes arrivés à découvrir d’une manière certaine un être intermédiaire entre les anthropoïdes actuels et l’homme''.&lt;ref name="Mortillet"/&gt;}}

{{quote|We are therefore forced to admit, as a consequence of a logical deduction drawn from the direct observation of the facts, that intelligent animals who knew how to make fire and cut stones in the Tertiary Period, were not men in the geological and paleontological sense of the word, but animals of another kind, precursors of Man in the [[Great chain of being|chain of beings]], precursors to whom I gave the name ''Anthropopithecus''. Thus, by reasoning alone, firmly supported by precise observations, we have come to discover with certainty a being intermediate between the present [[Simian|anthropoids]] and Man.}}

When in 1905 the French [[Paleontology|paleontologist]], [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] and [[geologist]] [[Marcellin Boule]] (1861–1942) published a paper demonstrating that the eoliths were in fact [[geofact]]s produced by natural phenomena ([[freezing]], [[Metamorphic rock|pressure]], [[Wildfire|fire]]), the argument proposed by De Mortillet fell into disrepute and his definition of the term ''Anthropopithecus'' was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcellin Boule]], "''L''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''origine des éolithes''", ''L''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Anthropologie'' (1905), tome 16, pp. 257–267 {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the chimpanzee meaning of the genus persisted throughout the [[19th century]], even to the point of being a genus name attributed to [[fossil]] [[Biological specimen|specimens]]. For example, a fossil primate discovered in 1878 by the British [[Malacology|malacologist]] [[William Theobald]] (1829-1908) in the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]] in [[British Raj|British India]] was first named ''Palaeopithecus'' in 1879 but later renamed ''Anthropopithecus sivalensis'', assuming that these remains had to be brought back to the chimpanzee genus as the latter was being understood at the time. A famous example of a fossil ''Anthropopithecus'' is that of the [[Java Man]], discovered in 1891 in [[Trinil]], nearby the [[Solo River]], in [[East Java]], by Dutch physician and anatomist [[Eugène Dubois]], who named the discovery with the scientific name ''Anthropopithecus erectus''. This Dubois paper, written during the last quarter of 1892, was published by the Dutch government in 1893. In those early 1890s, the term ''Anthropopithecus'' was still being used by zoologists as the genus name of chimpanzees, so Dubois' ''Anthropopithecus erectus'' came to mean something like "the upright chimpanzee", or "the chimpanzee standing up". However, a year later, in 1893, Dubois considered that some anatomical characters proper to humans made necessary the attribution of these remains to a genus different than ''Anthropopithecus'' and he renamed the specimen of Java with the name ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (1893 paper, published in 1894). ''Pithecanthropus'' is a genus that German [[biologist]] [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919) had created in 1868.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"/&gt; Years later, in the [[20th century]], the German [[physician]] and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]] [[Franz Weidenreich]] (1873-1948) compared in detail the characters of Dubois' Java Man, then named ''Pithecanthropus erectus'', with the characters of the [[Peking Man]], then named ''Sinanthropus pekinensis''. Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of their anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to gather all these specimens of Java and China in a single species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'', the species ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref name="Wiley-Blackwell-Encyclopedia-Human-Evolution"/&gt; By that time, the genus ''Anthropopithecus'' had already been abandoned since 1895 at the earliest.

== In popular culture ==
The term ''Anthropopithecus'' is scientifically obsolete in the present day but did become widespread in popular culture, mainly in [[France]] and [[Belgium]]:
* In his [[short story]] ''[[Gil Braltar]]'' (1887), [[Jules Verne]] uses the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'') to describe the simian aspect of one his characters, General McKackmale:
{{quote|''Il dormait bien, le général Mac Kackmale, sur ses deux oreilles, plus longues que ne le comporte l’ordonnance. Avec ses bras démesurés, ses yeux ronds, enfoncés sous de rudes sourcils, sa face encadrée d’une barbe rêche, sa physionomie grimaçante, ses gestes d’'''anthropopithèque''', le prognathisme extraordinaire de sa mâchoire, il était d’une laideur remarquable, – même chez un général anglais. Un vrai singe, excellent militaire, d’ailleurs, malgré sa tournure simiesque.''}}
{{quote|He slept well, did General MacKackmale, with both eyes shut, though longer than was permitted by regulations. With his long arms, his round eyes deeply set under their beetling brows, his face embellished with a stubbly beard, his grimaces, his semi-human gestures,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The sentence ''ses gestes d’anthropopithèque'' was translated in 1959 by Idrisyn Oliver Evans as "his semi-human gestures".&lt;/ref&gt; the extraordinary jutting-out of his jaw, he was remarkably ugly, even for an English general. Something of a monkey but an excellent soldier nevertheless, in spite of his apelike appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the French by Idrisyn Oliver Evans –''The Best From Fantasy and Science Fiction'' (1959), 8th series, edited by Anthony Boucher, Ace Books, New York&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* In the science-fiction novel ''La Cité des Ténèbres'' (''The City of Darkness''), written by French journalist and writer [[Léon Groc]] in 1926, the ''anthropopithèques'' (''Anthropopithecuses'') are a large herd of ape-men having reached a very low degree of civilisation.
* The [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Comics artist|comics author]] [[Hergé]] made the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'') one of the numerous [[Profanity|swear words]] of [[Captain Haddock]] in the [[comic album]] series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Algoud, ''Le Haddock illustré, l'intégrale des jurons du capitaine'', Casterman (collection "Bibliothèque de Moulinsart"), Brussels, November 1991, 93 p., 23,2cm x 15cm ; {{ISBN|978-2203017108}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* In 2001, French singer [[Brigitte Fontaine]] wrote, sang and recorded the song titled ''Pipeau''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The French word ''pipeau'' refers to a type of [[Pipe (instrument)|pipe]], but in French slang ''pipeau'' also refers to a lie.&lt;/ref&gt; In this song, the chorus repeats the term ''anthropopithèque'' (''Anthropopithecus'').

'''Biological immortality''' (sometimes referred to ''bio-indefinite'' mortality) is a state in which the [[rate of mortality]] from [[senescence]] is stable or decreasing, thus decoupling it from [[chronological]] age. Various unicellular and multicellular species, including some vertebrates, achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough. A [[Biology|biologically]] immortal [[life|living]] being can still die from means other than senescence, such as through injury or disease.

This definition of [[immortality]] has been challenged in the ''Handbook of the Biology of Aging'',&lt;ref name="Masoro2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=E.J. |last=Masoro |editor=Austad, S.N. |year=2006 |title=Handbook of the Biology of Aging |edition=Sixth |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego, CA |isbn=0-12-088387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age may be negligible at extremely [[old age]]s, an idea referred to as the [[Late-life mortality deceleration|late-life mortality plateau]]. The rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age, but in most cases that rate is typically very high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Late life: a new frontier for physiology |author1=Michael R.

The term is also used by biologists to describe cells that are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]] on how many times they can divide.

==Cell lines==
{{Main article|Cell culture|Immortalised cell line}}
[[Biologist]]s chose the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]], the point at which cells can no longer divide due to [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. Prior to [[Leonard Hayflick]]'s theory, [[Alexis Carrel]] hypothesized that all normal [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells were immortal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shay, J.

The term "immortalization" was first applied to [[cancer]] cells that expressed the telomere-lengthening [[enzyme]] [[telomerase]], and thereby avoided [[apoptosis]]—i.e. cell death caused by intracellular mechanisms. Among the most commonly used cell lines are [[HeLa]] and [[Jurkat cells|Jurkat]], both of which are immortalized cancer cell lines. HeLa cells originated from a sample of [[cervical cancer]] taken from [[Henrietta Lacks]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="Immortal Life"&gt;{{cite book | last = Skloot | first = Rebecca | authorlink = Rebecca Skloot | title = [[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]] | publisher = Crown/Random House | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4000-5217-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cells have been and still are widely used in biological research such as creation of the [[polio vaccine]],&lt;ref name="Smith_2002"&gt;{{cite news | first = Van | last = Smith | title = The Life, Death, and Life After Death of Henrietta Lacks, Unwitting Heroine of Modern Medical Science. | url = http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 | publisher = [[Baltimore City Paper]] | date = 2002-04-17 | accessdate = 2010-03-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814160109/http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 | archivedate = 2004-08-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; sex hormone steroid research,&lt;ref&gt;Bulzomi, Pamela.

===Bacteria and some yeast===
Many unicellular organisms age: as time passes, they divide more slowly and ultimately die. Asymmetrically dividing [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]] also age. However, symmetrically dividing [[bacteria]] and [[yeast]] can be biologically immortal under ideal growing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Current Biology: Volume 23, Issue 19, 7 October 2013, Pages 1844–1852 "Fission Yeast Does Not Age under Favorable Conditions, but Does So after Stress." Miguel Coelho1, 4, Aygül Dereli1, Anett Haese1, Sebastian Kühn2, Liliana Malinovska1, Morgan E. DeSantis3, James Shorter3, Simon Alberti1, Thilo Gross2, 5, Iva M. Tolić-Nørrelykke1&lt;/ref&gt; In these conditions, when a cell splits symmetrically to produce two daughter cells, the process of [[cell division]] can restore the cell to a youthful state. However, if the parent asymmetrically buds off a daughter only the daughter is reset to the youthful state—the parent isn't restored and will go on to age and die. In a similar manner [[stem cell]]s and [[gamete]]s can be regarded as "immortal".

===Hydra===
[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|''Hydra'']]
[[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] are a [[genus]] of the [[Cnidaria]] phylum. All cnidarians can regenerate, allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Hydras are simple, [[freshwater]] animals possessing [[radial symmetry]] and no post-[[mitotic]] cells. All hydra cells continually divide.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} It has been suggested that hydras do not undergo [[senescence]], and, as such, are biologically immortal. In a four-year study, 3 cohorts of hydra did not show an increase in mortality with age. It is possible that these animals live much longer, considering that they reach maturity in 5 to 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martínez |first=Daniel E. |year=1998 |url=http://www.biochem.uci.edu/Steele/PDFs/Hydra_senescence_paper.pdf |title=Mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in Hydra |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=217–225 |publisher=Elsevier Science Inc. |doi=10.1016/S0531-5565(97)00113-7 |pmid=9615920 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426043703/http://www.biochem.uci.edu/steele/PDFs/Hydra_senescence_paper.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not explain how hydras are consequently able to maintain [[telomere]] lengths.

===Jellyfish===
''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', or ''[[Turritopsis nutricula]]'', is a small ({{convert|5|mm|in|sp=us}}) species of [[jellyfish]] that uses [[transdifferentiation]] to replenish cells after [[sexual reproduction]]. This cycle can repeat indefinitely, potentially rendering it biologically immortal. This organism originated in the [[Caribbean sea]], but has now spread around the world.

===Lobsters===
{{further information|Lobster#Longevity}}
Research suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters may be more fertile than younger lobsters. This does not however make them immortal in the traditional sense, as they are significantly more likely to die at a shell moult the older they get (as detailed below).

Their longevity may be due to [[telomerase]], an [[enzyme]] that repairs long repetitive sections of [[DNA sequence]]s at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as [[telomeres]]. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cong YS | title = Human Telomerase and Its Regulation | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–425 |date=2002 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002 | pmid=12208997 | pmc=120798}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfram Klapper |author2=Karen Kühne |author3=Kumud K.

===Planarian flatworms===
[[File:Polycelis felina.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Polycelis felina'', a freshwater planarian]]
[[Planarian|Planarian flatworms]] have both sexually and asexually reproducing types. Studies on genus [[Schmidtea mediterranea]] suggest these planarians appear to regenerate (i.e. heal) indefinitely, and asexual individuals have an "apparently limitless [telomere] regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells". "Both asexual and sexual animals display age-related decline in telomere length; however, asexual animals are able to maintain telomere lengths somatically (i.e. during reproduction by fission or when regeneration is induced by [[amputation]]), whereas sexual animals restore telomeres by extension during sexual reproduction or during embryogenesis like other sexual species. Homeostatic telomerase activity observed in both asexual and sexual animals is not sufficient to maintain telomere length, whereas the increased activity in regenerating asexuals is sufficient to renew telomere length...

Lifespan: For sexually reproducing planaria: "the lifespan of individual planarian can be as long as 3 years, likely due to the ability of neoblasts to constantly replace aging cells". Whereas for asexually reproducing planaria: "individual animals in clonal lines of some planarian species replicating by fission have been maintained for over 15 years". They do not live forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geochembio.com/biology/organisms/planarian/#dev_stages|title=''Schmidtea '', model planarian|website=www.geochembio.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230230657/http://www.geochembio.com/biology/organisms/planarian/#dev_stages|archivedate=2010-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve the more limited goal of halting the increase in mortality rate with age, a solution must be found to the fact that any intervention to remove senescent cells that creates competition among cells will increase age-related mortality from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Paul |last2=Masel |first2=Joanna |title=Intercellular competition and the inevitability of multicellular aging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=5 December 2017 |volume=114 |issue=49 |pages=12982–12987 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1618854114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg|thumb|A chimeric mouse with its [[offspring]]]]
A '''genetic chimerism''' or '''chimera''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/kɪˈmɪərə/]] or [[Help:IPA/English|/kaɪˈmɪərə/]], also '''chimaera''' (c''himæra'') is a single organism composed of cells with distinct [[genotype]]s. In animals, this means an individual derived from two or more [[zygote]]s, which can include possessing [[blood cell]]s of different [[blood type]]s, subtle variations in form ([[phenotype]]) and, if the zygotes were of differing sexes, then even the possession of both female and male [[sex organs]]&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt; (this is just one of many different ways that may result in [[intersexuality]]). Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs. In plant chimeras, however, the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same [[zygote]], and the difference is often due to [[mutation]] during ordinary [[cell division]]. Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Friedman| first1=Lauren| title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of A Woman Who Was Her Own Twin| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lydia-fairchild-is-her-own-twin-2014-2| accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by [[organ (biology)|organ]] transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of [[bone marrow]] often determines the recipient's ensuing [[blood type]].

==Animals==
An animal chimera is a single [[organism]] that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct [[cell (biology)|cells]] that originated from different [[zygote]]s involved in [[sexual reproduction]]. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimerism have been documented.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

This condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of [[allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic cell]]s during [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel [[anastomose]]s. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via [[in vitro fertilization|in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref name="Strain" /&gt; Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of [[intersex]] differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.

===Tetragametic chimerism===
Tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the [[blastocyst]] or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two [[twin|nonidentical twins]] (a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct, the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera). As such, they can be male, female, or have mixed intersex characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As the organism develops, it can come to possess [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s that have different sets of [[chromosome]]s. For example, the chimera may have a [[liver]] composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a [[kidney]] composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes. This has occurred in humans, and at one time was thought to be extremely rare, though more recent evidence suggests that it is not the case.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Aaron|author2=Ozzie Zehner|title=Which Half Is Mommy?: Tetragametic Chimerism and Trans-Subjectivity|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|year=2008|volume=Fall/Winter|pages=106–127|url=https://ucdavis.academia.edu/AaronTNorton/Papers/126923/Which_Half_Is_Mommy_Tetragametic_Chimerism_and_Trans-Subjectivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boklage, C.E. How New Humans Are Made. Hackensack, NJ; London: World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd; 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This is particularly true for the [[marmoset]]. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their [[fraternal twin]]s.&lt;ref name="Ross2007" /&gt; 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through [[chorionic]] fusions, making them [[hematopoietic]] chimeras.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=cell|title=Generation of Chimeric Rhesus Monkeys| author=Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and [[Shoukhrat Mitalipov]]| date=January 2012| pmc=3264685| pmid=22225614| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.007| volume=148| pages=285–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=N.| last1=Gengozian| last2=Batson| first2=JS| first3=P.| last3=Eide| title=Hematologic and Cytogenetic Evidence for Hematopoietic Chimerism in the Marmoset, Tamarinus Nigricollis| journal=Cytogenetics| year=1964| volume=10| pages=384–393.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most chimeras will go through life without realizing they are chimeras. The difference in phenotypes may be subtle (''e.g.'', having a [[Thumb#Variations|hitchhiker's thumb]] and a straight thumb, eyes of slightly different colors, differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body, etc.) or completely undetectable. Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called [[Blaschko's lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75| title=2 ) In the chimera episode, the fact that the [subject] was a chimera was first established through a camera flash on the skin illuminating skin anomalies...| work=Ask a Geneticist| publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford School of Medicine]]| author= Barry Starr | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035334/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |archivedate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, [[ambiguous genitalia]] and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or [[eye pigmentation]] ([[heterochromia]]). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] of both sexes may be formed: either [[ovary]] and [[testis]], or combined [[ovotestes]], in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as ''[[true hermaphroditism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Note that the frequency of this condition does ''not'' indicate the true prevalence of chimerism. Most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition, as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body. Often, most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line, i.e. the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line, and the internal organs of the other cell line. Genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics. 

Natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male [[tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]]s and [[calico cat|calico]]s (although most male tortoiseshells have an extra X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The existence of chimerism is problematic for DNA testing, a fact with implications for family and criminal law. The [[Lydia Fairchild]] case, for example, was brought to court after DNA testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers. Fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged. The charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that Lydia was a chimera, with the matching DNA being found in her cervical tissue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Another case was that of '''Karen Keegan''', who was also suspected (initially) of not being her children's biological mother, after DNA tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed seemed to show she was not their mother.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |title=The Twin Inside Me: Extraordinary People |publisher=[[Five (TV channel) |Channel 5 TV, UK]] |date=9 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526105634/http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tetragametic state has important implications for organ or [[stem cell]] transplantation. Chimeras typically have [[immunologic tolerance]] to both cell lines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Microchimerism===
{{Main| Microchimerism}}

Microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mothers' have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.
The higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and whether or not microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bellefon | first1 = L. | last2 = Heiman | first2 = P. | last3 = Kanaan | first3 = S. | last4 = Azzouz | first4 = D. | last5 = Rak | first5 = J. | last6 = Martin | first6 = M. | last7 = Roudier | first7 = J. | last8 = Roufosse | first8 = F. | last9 = Lambert | first9 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Cells from a vanished twin as a source of microchimerism 40 years later | url = | journal = Chimerism | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | doi=10.4161/chim.1.2.14294| pmc = 3023624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often also have a few cells genetically identical to that of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to that of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish===
Chimerism occurs naturally in adult [[Ceratiidae|Ceratioid]] [[anglerfish]] and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong [[olfactory|olfactory (or smell)]] receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] individual. Sometimes in this process more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. They will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large [[testicle]]s as their other organs [[atrophy]]. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ceratiidae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germline chimerism===
Germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]] cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own. It has recently been discovered that [[marmoset]]s can carry the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings, because of placental fusion during development. (Marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins.)&lt;ref name="Ross2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ross| first=C. N.|author2=J. A. French | author3=G.

* The Dutch sprinter [[Foekje Dillema]] was expelled from the 1950 national team after she refused a mandatory sex test in July 1950; later investigations revealed a Y-chromosome in her body cells, and the analysis showed that she probably was a 46,XX/46,XY mosaic female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ballantyne | first1 = KN | last2 = Kayser | first2 = M | last3 = Grootegoed | first3 = JA | year =2011 | title = 'Sex and gender issues in competitive sports: investigation of a historical case leads to a new viewpoint' | url = | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 46| issue = 8| pages = 614–7| doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2010.082552 | pmid=21540190 | pmc=3375582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
In biological research, chimeras are artificially produced by selectively transplanting embryonic cells from one organism onto the embryo of another, and allowing the resultant blastocyst to develop. Chimeras are not [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], which form from the fusion of [[gametes]] from two species that form a single [[zygote]] with a combined genetic makeup. Nor are they [[Hybridoma technology|Hybridomas]], which, as with hybrids, result from the fusion of two species' cells into a single cell and artificial propagation of this cell in the laboratory. Essentially, in a chimera, each cell is from either of the parent species, whereas in a hybrid and hybridoma, each cell is derived from both parent species. "Chimera" is a broad term and is often applied to many different mechanisms of the mixing of cells from two different species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As with cloning, the process of creating and implanting a chimera is imprecise, with the majority of embryos spontaneously terminating. Successes, however, have led to major advancements in the field of embryology, as creating chimeras of one species with different physical traits, such as colour, has allowed researchers to trace the differentiation of embryonic cells through the formation of organ systems in the adult individual.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The first known primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins, Roku and Hex, with each having six genomes. They were created by mixing cells from [[totipotent]] four cell blastocysts; although the cells never fused they worked together to form organs. It was discovered that one of these primates, Roku, was a sexual chimera; as four percent of Roku's blood cells contained two x chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"/&gt;

A major milestone in chimera experimentation occurred in 1984, when a chimeric [[sheep-goat chimera|geep]] was produced by combining [[embryo]]s from a [[goat]] and a [[sheep]], and survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921546,00.html | title = It's a Geep | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 27 February 1984 | accessdate = 4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the "geep" revealed several complexities to chimera development. In implanting a goat embryo for gestation in a sheep, the sheep's immune system would reject the developing goat embryo, whereas a "geep" embryo (sharing markers of immunity with both sheep and goats) was able to survive implantation in either of its parent species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In August 2003, researchers at the [[Shanghai Second Medical University]] in China reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and [[rabbit]] ova to create the first human chimeric embryos. The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting, then destroyed to harvest the resulting [[stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0125_050125_chimeras.html| title=Animal-Human Hybrids Spark Controversy| last=Mott| first=Maryann| date=January 25, 2005| work=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, scientists at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] School of Medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15% human cells and 85% sheep cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |title=Iranian scientist creates sheep with half-human organs |date=27 Mar 2007 |work=[[Press TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114210217/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mice===
Chimeric mice are important animals in biological research, as they allow the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it. These include insights into such problems as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.
The general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mintz | first1 = B. | last2 = Silvers | first2 = W. K. | title = "Intrinsic" Immunological Tolerance in Allophenic Mice | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3807 | pages = 1484–6 | year = 1967 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3807.1484 |pmid=6058691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection on the other hand was pioneered by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected [[embryonic stem cells]] (ES cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(86)90161-7 | last1 = Robertson | first1 = EJ | year = 1986 | title = Pluripotential stem cell lines as a route into the mouse germ line | url = | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 9–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of [[homologous recombination]], thus allowing [[gene targeting]]. Since this discovery occurred in 1988, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8583 | last1 = Doetschman | first1 = T. | last2 = Maeda | first2 = N. | last3 = Smithies | first3 = O. | year = 1988 | title = Targeted mutation of the Hp gene in mouse embryonic stem cells | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. | volume = 85 | issue = 22| pages = 8583–8587 | pmid = 3186749 | pmc = 282503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying biology====
The ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development. Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the [[trophectoderm]], the [[inner cell mass]], and the [[primitive endoderm]]. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00478.x | last1 = Ralston | first1 = A | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Genetic regulation of stem cell origins in the mouse embryo | url = | journal = Clin Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the [[epiblast]], primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.00893 | last1 = Tam | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Mouse embryonic chimeras: tools for studying mammalian development | url = | journal = Development | volume = 130 | issue = 25| pages = 6155–6163 | pmid = 14623817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rossant | first1 = J. | year = 1976 | title = Postimplantation development of blastomeres isolated from 4- and 8-cell mouse eggs | url = | journal = J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 283–290 | pmid = 1033982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other. For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst for example can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Pappaioannou, V., R. Johnson. (1993). Production of chimeras and genetically defined offspring from targeted ES cells. In Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (ed. A.Joyner) IRL Press at Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
From this knowledge, [[ES cell]] contributions to chimeras have been developed. ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(85)90143-0 | last1 = Kubiak | first1 = J | last2 = Tarkowski | first2 = A. | year = 1985 | title = Electrofusion of mouse blastomeres.

Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (Joyner, A, ed.) IRL Press at Oxford University, Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods of production====
There are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8804 | last1 = Jasin | first1 = M | last2 = Moynahan | first2 = ME | last3 = Richardson | first3 = C | year = 1996 | title = Targeted transgenesis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 17| pages = 8804–8808 | pmid = 8799106 | pmc = 38547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0958067000021059 | last1 = Ledermann | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Embryonic Stem Cell and Gene Targeting | url = | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 603–613 | pmid = 11187956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse, which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse's ES cells.&lt;ref&gt;Chimera Mouse production by blastocyst injection, Wellcome trust Sanger Institute, http://www.eucomm.org/docs/protocols/mouse_protocol_1_Sanger.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tanaka | first1 = M | last2 = Hadjantonakis | first2 = AK | last3 = Nagy | first3 = A | title = Aggregation chimeras.

===Structure===
The distinction between sectorial, mericlinal and periclinal '''plant chimeras''' are widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z5LwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;dq=The+plastids:+their+chemistry,+structure,+growth+and+inheritance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=38m0Tee4O8ns0gHR0JGWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' The plastids: their chemistry, structure, growth and inheritance''], 2nd edition,1978, Elsevier/ North-Holland, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-80022-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c0JLPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Mutation+breeding+techniques+and+behavior+of+irradiated+shoot+apices+of+potato&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=18q0TYacDajg0gGp9b31CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA '' Mutation breeding techniques and behavior of irradiated shoot apices of potato''], 1978, Pudoc, Wageingen&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graft chimeras===
{{Main|Graft-chimaera}}
[[File:Taxus-mosaic1.JPG|thumb| [[Taxus]] mosaic.]]
These are produced by grafting genetically different parents, different [[cultivar]]s or different species (which may belong to different genera). The tissues may be partially fused together following [[grafting]] to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norris, R. |author2=Smith, R.H. |author3=Vaughn, K.C. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Plant chimeras used to establish de novo origin of shoots | journal=Science | year=1983 | pages=75–76 | volume=220 | doi=10.1126/science.220.4592.75 | issue=4592 | pmid=17736164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features, so the behavior of their [[periclinal]] chimeras is like to be highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9rxMGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Plant+Chimeras&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fCO6Te3DEoKutweGpaC3AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ ''Plant Chimeras''], 1st edition, 1992, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42787-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first such known chimera was probably the [[Bizzaria]], which is a fusion of the [[Florentine citron]] and the [[sour orange]]. Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are [[+Laburnocytisus 'Adamii'|''Laburnocytisus'' 'Adamii']], caused by a fusion of a ''[[Laburnum]]'' and a [[Broom (shrub)|broom]], and "Family" trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree. Many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a [[rootstock]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Chromosomal chimeras===
These are chimeras in which the layers differ in their [[chromosome]] constitution. Occasionally chimeras arise from loss or gain of individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments owing to [[cell division|misdivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thompson, J.D. |author2=Herre, E.A. |author3=Hamrick, J.L. |author4=Stone, J.L. |last-author-amp=yes| title= Genetic Mosaics in strangler Fig Trees: Implication for Tropical Conservation | journal=Science | year=1991 | pages=1214–1216 | volume=254 | issue=5035 | doi= 10.1126/science.254.5035.1214 | pmid=17776412}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly cytochimeras have simple multiple of the normal chromosome complement in the changed layer. There are various effects on cell size and growth characteristics.

===Nuclear gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a nuclear gene to a dominant or recessive allele. As a rule one character is affected at a time in the leaf, flower, fruit, or other parts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Plastid gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a plastid gene, followed by the sorting-out of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth. Alternatively, after selfing or [[nucleic acid thermodynamics]], plastids may sort-out from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively. This type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves. After sorting-out is complete, periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear gene-differential chimeras by their [[mendelian inheritance|non-mendelian inheritance]]. The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All plastid gene- and some nuclear gene-differential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves, and these are grouped together as [[chlorophyll]] chimeras, or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras. For most variegation, the mutation involved is the loss of the [[chloroplast]]s in the mutated tissue, so that part of the plant tissue has no green pigment and no [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] ability. This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own but is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue. Sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Origins===
There are multiple reasons to explain the occurrence of plant chimera during plant recovery stage:

(1) The process of shoot [[organogenesis]] starts form the multicellular origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhu, X. |author2=Zhao, M. |author3=Ma, S. |author4=Ge, Y. |author5=Zhang, M. |author6=Chen, L. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Induction and origin of adventitious shoots from chimeras of Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=1727–1732 | volume=26 | issue=10 | doi=10.1007/s00299-007-0398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) The endogenous tolerance leads to the ineffectiveness of the weak selective agents.

(3) A self-protection mechanism (cross protection). Transformed cells serve as guards to protect the untransformed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park SH, Rose SC, Zapata C, Srivatanakul M | title= Cross-protection and selectable marker genes in plant transformation. | journal= In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant| year=1998 | pages=117–121 | volume=34 | issue=2 | doi= 10.1007/BF02822775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(4) The observable characteristic of transgenic cells may be a transient expression of the marker gene. Or it may due to the presence of agrobacterium cells.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Detection===
Untransformed cells should be easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras. Because it’s extremely important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as [[GUS reporter system|GUS]] and [[Green Fluorescent Protein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rakosy-Tican, E. |author2=Aurori, C.M. |author3=Dijkstra, C. |author4=Thieme, R. |author5=Aurori, A. |author6=Davey, M.R. |last-author-amp=yes | title=The usefulness of the gfp reporter gene for monitoring Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of potato dihaploid and tetraploid genotypes | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=661–671 | volume=26 | issue=5 | doi=10.1007/s00299-006-0273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP may be influenced by the green tissue autofluorescence. [[Quantitative PCR]] could be an alternative method for chimera detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Faize, M., Faize, L. and Burgos, L. | title=Using quantitative real-time PCR to detect chimeras in transgenic tobacco and apricot and to monitor their dissociation | journal=BMC Biotechnology | year=2010 | pages=53 | volume=10 | issue=1 | doi=10.1186/1472-6750-10-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and legislation==
{{See also|Bioethics}}

===Ethics===
The US and Western Europe have strict codes of ethics and regulations in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, though there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Futehally, Ilmas, Beyond Biology, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] [http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=77#.UyZHJ1GSxv0]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights.&lt;ref name="Defining Humanity"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bruch| first1=Quinton| title=Defining Humanity: The Ethics of Chimeric Animals and Organ Growing |url=http://triplehelixblog.com/2014/02/defining-humanity-the-ethics-of-chimeric-animals-and-organ-growing/| website=The Triple Helix Online| accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Brownback| first1=Samuel| title=S.659 – Human Chimera Prohibition Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate - IS)| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.659:| website=The Library of Congress THOMAS| accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
{{anchor|Chimera_(genetics)#Legislation}}&lt;!-- linked from [[Human Chimera Prohibition Act]] --&gt;In May 2008, a robust debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the ethics of creating chimeras with human stem cells led to the decision that embryos would be allowed to be made in laboratories, given that they would be destroyed within the first 14 days.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On 11 July 2005, a bill, The Human Chimera Prohibition Act, was introduced into the [[United States Congress]] by Senator 
[[Samuel Brownback]]; however, it died in Congress sometime in the next year. The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this, serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"/&gt; Since the bill's death in congress, there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the United States.

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

==Mathematics==

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.

{{main|Chirality (chemistry)}}

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

More recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moloney|first=Mícheál P.|last2=Gun'ko|first2=Yurii K.|last3=Kelly|first3=John M.|date=2007-09-26|title=Chiral highly luminescent CdS quantum dots|url=https://doi.org/10.1039/b704636g|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=0|issue=38|doi=10.1039/b704636g|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaaff|first=T.

==Biology==
{{See also|Homochirality}}

All of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Wende|last2=Ernst|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Palotas|first3=Krisztian|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuyang|last5=Bruyer|first5=Emilie|last6=Peng|first6=Lingqing|last7=Greber|first7=Thomas|last8=Hofer|first8=Werner A.|last9=Scott|first9=Lawrence T.|date=2016-02-08|title=Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2449|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=8|issue=4|pages=326–330|doi=10.1038/nchem.2449|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Sometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions. For example, (+)-Limonene found in orange (causing its smell), and (–)-Limonene found in Lemons (causing its smell), show different smells&lt;ref&gt;Solomon and Fryhles organic chemistry, Ed 10, Wiley (Students edition), Chapter 5 (Stereochemistry), Section 5.5 More about biological significance of chirality&lt;/ref&gt; due to different biochemical interactions at human nose. (+)-Carvone is responsible for the smell of [[Caraway]] seed oil whereas (–)-carvone is responsible for smell of [[Spearmint]] oil.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon and Fryhles organic chemistry, Ed 10, Wiley (Students edition), Chapter 5 (Stereochemistry), review problem 5.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, for artificial compounds, including medicines, in case of chiral drugs, the two enantiomers sometimes show remarkable difference in effect of their biological actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanganyado|first=Edmond|last2=Lu|first2=Zhijiang|last3=Fu|first3=Qiuguo|last4=Schlenk|first4=Daniel|last5=Gan|first5=Jay|date=2017|title=Chiral pharmaceuticals: A review on their environmental occurrence and fate processes|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0043135417306565|journal=Water Research|volume=124|pages=527–542|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.003|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvon ([[Dextropropoxyphene]]) is a painkiller, whereas its enantiomer, Novrad ([[Levopropoxyphene]]) is an anti-cough agent.

Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

[[File:Neptunea - links&amp;rechts gewonden.jpg|thumb|200px|Shells of two different species of sea snail: on the left is the normally sinistral (left-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea angulata]]'', on the right is the normally dextral (right-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea despecta]]'']]
In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

The '''Coda''' is a group of [[fictional]] female [[warrior]]s in [[Wildstorm]] [[comic book|comics]]. The Coda first appeared in ''[[WildC.A.T.S.]]'' volume 1 #1 (August, 1992) and were created by [[Brandon Choi]] and [[Jim Lee]]. 

==Fictional background==
The Coda are a particular race of all female aliens who live on the planet Khera. They are trained in their own unique form of martial arts. Their weapon of choice is the Clef Blade, a weapon resembling a harpoon or a lance, though they often wield swords or even modern firearms. Coda warriors usually wear red markings on their face.  A sign (usually a circle) on the forehead and stripes on the cheeks) depicting their ranking within the sisterhood. A second class group of Coda warriors of different species have formed on various planets, carrying the blood of original Coda warriors only.

===Khera===
The Coda was founded on the planet Khera, home to the [[Kherubim]]. The Kherubim were a race blessed with longevity, but the downside was that they had become nearly infertile. Childbirth was a great honor and therefore every Kheran had to participate in a ritual in which a Kheran female and a Kheran male had to couple once. Should the female become pregnant and give birth, she would go on to become a priestess. Otherwise she could do with her life as she pleased. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] had been selected to mate with [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] and their union did result in childbirth, the child [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]. Zannah, though, loved being a warrior; so her mother, Harmony, proposed a plan: She would tell her people that Zannah's child had died, and would raise Kenesha as her own daughter. Zannah accepted, and Harmony became a figure of legend, the only Kherubim to have given birth to more than one child in ages. This legend was the foundation of the Sisterhood known as the Coda, a completely female [[caste]] of warriors, devoted to the honor of combat. Their male counterpart is known as the Brotherhood of the Sword. Over the millennia, the Coda would grow in power, and at present they are the second largest political faction within Kherubim society. Only the Pantheon is slightly larger. The Coda's headquarters is Zealot's former home, the Tower of Red Lament. Among the Coda on Khera, there is a small cell of elite assassins called the Skein. They have no known counterpart among the Earthborn Coda. The first rule of The Coda is: ''The weapon is the extension of the flesh, the flesh of the mind, the mind of the soul''.

===Earth===
The Kherubim were at war with the [[Daemonite]]s, another spacefaring race. During a ship-to-ship combat, a Kheran and a Daemonite vessel crashlanded on Earth. Both Zannah and Kenesha were on board this vessel. The Kherubim were physically identical to humans and quickly integrated within human society, inspiring tales of superhuman heroes, gods and angels. The Daemonites had the ability to possess human hosts and inspired tales of possession, demons and monsters. Their war continued underground. 

To aid them in their war, Zannah, now called Zealot and two of her fellow Coda generals, Andromache and Artemis, started training human Coda Warriors, giving birth to the myth of the Amazons. They established a hidden Coda city on Mt. Themyscira in [[Greece]]. Kenesha took the name [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]], but had no desire to join the Coda. As the Earthborn sisterhood are not born immortals, the immortal members take part in a ''Blood Dance'' with the newer members worthy of being called Coda Warriors. In the ritual they cut each other in a ritualistic dance and rub each other's wounds, thus mingling the blood, transferring the immortal blood into the non-immortal. The blood of a Kherubim, mingled with a human's during a special ritual, gave the gift of longevity to normal humans and this became an important ritual for Earth's Coda. The Kheran Coda sisterhood have been shown to perform this ritual also, but as they are all immortal, their reasons have more to do with the symbolic than with the need for survival. The Coda's Cleft Blades, both on Khera and on Earth, are considered very sacred to the sisterhood. They are only to be used in a death duel or in their ritual Blood Dance. During a battle near Troy (presumably the [[Trojan War]]), Zealot's actions branded her as a traitor to the rest of the Coda, to be killed on sight. The Coda general Andromache took over the role of [[Majestrix]]. Under her rule the Coda began selling their skills to the highest bidders and became less noble warriors and more power hungry conquerors. They also began establishing smaller Coda bases around the world. Though Mt. Themyscira still proved to be the oldest and most sacred of homes to the Amazons, the Coda have also been shown to reside in a massive island off the coast of Africa which they refer to as the Coda Citadel, as discovered by members of [[Gen¹³]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gen¹³'' (vol. 2), #3-5&lt;/ref&gt;  As Zealot was seen as a traitor to the sisterhood, she became a constant target of The Coda for several centuries.

[[Image:CodaWarrior.JPG|thumb|[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]] displays standard Coda weapons, such as the Cleft Blade]]
In the mid 20th century, Zealot trained [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] in the fighting style of the Coda, making him the first male Coda. When the Coda discovered this they marked Grifter a target for extermination as they believed the Coda ways are only to be carried by women. By now many Coda were working for the Cabal, an organisation founded by the Daemonites. Zealot, Grifter and Savant all were part of the [[WildC.A.T.s]] and Zealot also eventually trained WildC.A.T.s member [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] in the Coda martial arts. The WildC.A.T.s and Coda fought often. The WildC.A.T.s returned once to Khera where Zealot was nearly assassinated by her own Coda Sisters, just to make her a martyr for their cause. Zealot was disgusted with the Sisters betrayal of their ideals and returned to Earth with the other WildC.A.T.s.

Several months later on Earth, Zealot apparently died on a mission causing the WildC.A.T.s to disband. She decided that the actions of the Coda on Earth and on Khera proved that the Coda had become corrupt and decided that the corruption had to be destroyed. She set out to single-handedly erase the Coda from the face of the Earth. She killed all Coda in America she could find, but spared Grifter, because of their shared romantic past. She warned him not to follow her.

Zealot continued her quest in Europe and destroyed most of the Coda there, but was captured by their top agent, The Grand Sarin. Grifter gathered several allies to save her, resulting in a war between his forces and the Coda. In the end, his small group turned out not to be enough, but Grifter called in the help of former WildC.A.T.s member and his current employer, [[Spartan (comics)|Jack Marlowe]], who used his powers to teleport part of the Mediterranean Sea on top of the Coda, drowning many of them. Majestrix Andromache survived and with her surviving troops she faced Grifter and his friends. At the same time FBI-agent Chandler, whose partner had been killed by the Coda, had found the Coda's armory. Chandler detonated the armory, blowing up the entire Coda base. Grifter and his friends were teleported away by Marlowe in time, but Andromache and her soldiers were caught in the blast.

Currently there are only few Earth-born Coda left. Majestrix Andromache was among the Coda fighting Grifter and his allies and died in the explosion. Recently, in the pages of ''Majestic'', [[Mister Majestic]] and Zealot have encountered Kherubim Coda Warriors on Earth. Also the Coda-traitor Charis (known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]) recently joined forces with the former WildC.A.T.s in the pages of ''Wildcats: Nemesis''. During the ''Wildstorm Armageddon'' story line The few remaining Coda were gathered up by the thought long dead Devin, formerly excommunicated acolyte of their order who survived into obscurity until the end of the world occurred. Gathering up the few remaining Coda survivors of the Post Apocalyptic world to create her own sisterhood, with her as Majestrix, which expanded its numbers through the weary travelers and soccer moms looking for safe respite that only her sect could provide, all while keeping any capable males captured as breeding labor in order to proliferate their ranks; Devin would eventually come into conflict with a past [[Caitlin Fairchild]] and her weathered survivor friends of [[Gen 13]].

==Notable members==

The '''Dorian Gray syndrome''' ('''DGS''') denotes a cultural and societal [[phenomenon]] characterized by a man's extreme [[pride]] in his personal appearance and the fitness of his physique, which is accompanied by difficulties in coping with the requirements of psychological maturation and with the [[aging]] of his body.

The DGS is characterized by a triad of symptoms that overlap, and so combine [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] signs of [[dysmorphophobia]], [[narcissistic]] character traits, and the immaturity of arrested development, which often are found in [[paraphilias]].&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Gieler et al. eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve ephemeral youth, the man afflicted with DGS tends to consume cosmetic products and services, hair-restoration procedures, anti-impotence drugs, and [[cosmetic surgery]]; hence, he might resist the [[psychosomatic]] and [[psychodynamic]] explanations of the [[syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;U. Gieler et al eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) pp. 47 and 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Dorian Gray syndrome" refers to the protagonist of the novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), an exceptionally handsome man whose [[hedonism]] and [[Narcissism|excessive self-love]] proved detrimental to the personal, social, and emotional aspects of his life, and who sought to escape the ravages of time and his own decadent lifestyle by having a supernatural portrait of himself age in his place.

==History==
[[File:Doriangray.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The portraitist Basil Hallward and Lord Henry Wotton observe the beauty recorded in the picture of Dorian Gray.]]
The DGS was first described in ''The Dorian Gray Syndrome: Psychodynamic Need for Hair growth Restorers and other "fountains of youth"'' (2001), in a symposium about the unrealistic male pursuit of bodily [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]] — by means of lifestyle-enhancing drugs, aesthetic surgery, and psychotropic medicines — and its consequences for his mental health as a social being.&lt;ref&gt;Brosig 2000, Brosig ''et al.'' 2001, Euler 2003 ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The culturally descriptive name of the syndrome refers to the eponymous protagonist of the novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1891), by Oscar Wilde, the story of a very handsome young man who much admires and envies the just-completed portrait of himself, and wishes that it would grow old, rather than he. In order to resist the physical corruptions of time and nature, and unable and unwilling to mature, Dorian Gray "gives his soul away", and his wish is granted.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil portrait and the narrative of the novel transgress and cite [[narcissistic]] mirror motives; as such, eternal beauty, aging, and maturation are represented with the psychological dyad of "the person and the mirror". The personal character of the man Dorian Gray is the background for the clinical description of the Dorian Gray [[syndrome]] that afflicts the patient.

==Causes==
The Dorian Gray syndrome arises from the concurring and overlapping clinical concepts of the [[narcissistic personality]], [[dysmorphophobia]], and [[Paraphilias|paraphilia]]. [[Psychodynamics|Psychodynamically]], the man afflicted with DGS presents an interplay among his narcissistic tendencies ("timeless beauty"), his arrested development (inability to psychologically mature), and his use of "medical lifestyle" products and services — hair restoration, drugs (for [[erectile dysfunction|impotence]], weight-loss, and mood modification), laser dermatology, and plastic surgery — in order to remain young.

Although the DGS patient displays diagnostic features of said mental disorders, the syndrome describes a common, underlying psychodynamics of mental illness, which is characterized by [[narcissistic defences]] against time-dependent maturation, expressed by actively seeking the timeless beauty of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Boese, ''Hippo Eats Dwarf'' (2010) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The article ''Das Dorian Gray syndrom'' (2005) reported that approximately 3.0 per cent of the population of Germany present features of the Dorian Gray syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Brosig, B., Euler, S., Brähler, E., Gieler, U. (2005) "Das Dorian Gray Syndrom", in Trüeb, R. A. (Hg.): Smart aging. Darmstadt, Steinkopff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic criteria for Dorian Gray syndrome are:
* Signs of [[dysmorphophobia]]
* Arrested development (inability to mature)
* Using at least two different medical-lifestyle products and services:
** Hair-growth restoration (e.g. [[Antiandrogen|finasteride]])
** Antiadiposita to lose weight (e.g. [[orlistat]])
** [[Erectile Dysfunction|Anti-impotence drugs]]  (e.g. [[sildenafil]])
** Anti-depressant drugs (e.g. [[fluoxetine]])
** [[Cosmetology|Cosmetic]] [[dermatology]] (e.g. laser resurfacing)
** [[Cosmetic surgery]] (e.g. a face-lift, [[liposuction]])

==Sequelae==
Episodes of [[major depressive disorder]] and of [[suicidal]] [[crisis]] occur in the man afflicted with Dorian Gray syndrome when the [[defense mechanism]] activities, the pursuit of eternal youth, fail to indefinitely preserve his handsome face and sculpted physique; usually, anti-depressant drugs and psychotherapy are prescribed and applied to counter his feelings of failure.&lt;ref&gt;U. Gieler et al eds., ''Clinical Management in Psychodermatology'' (2008) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, if the man misunderstands the self-defensive character of "acting out" the DGS, and continues pursuing the timeless beauty of male youth, without being aware of the psychodynamics of narcissism, then he, as a psychiatric patient, establishes a cycle of chronic [[Depression (mood)|psychological depression]]. In extreme cases of DGS, the man seeks self-destruction, by means either of [[Medication|drugs]] or with plastic surgery, or both, in order to fill the narcissistic emptiness that is the Dorian Gray syndrome.

==Analogous applications==
* In sport, the Dorian Gray syndrome is applied to ageing baseball players who retain their competitive edge (athleticism) with drugs that are illegal in professional sport.&lt;ref&gt;V. A Belton, ''Baseball is America'' (2010) p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In architecture, the Dorian Gray syndrome is applied to the rehabilitation of a building to a pristine condition greater than when the building was new.&lt;ref&gt;M. Glendinning, ''The Conservation Movement'' (2013) p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerontology'''  is the study of the [[social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[Psychology|psychological]], [[cognitive]], and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[ageing]]. The word was coined by [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] in 1903, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:γέρων|γέρων]], ''geron'', "old man" and -λογία, ''-logia'', "study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aghe.org/resources/gerontology-geriatrics-descriptions|title=Gerontology/Geriatrics Definitions|last=Confluence|website=www.aghe.org|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is distinguished from [[geriatrics]], which is the branch of medicine that specializes in the treatment of existing disease in older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, nursing, medicine, criminology, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, geography, pharmacy, public health, housing, and anthropology.&lt;ref name=Hooyman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooyman |first1=N.R. |last2=Kiyak |first2=H.A. |title=Social gerontology: A multidisciplinary perspective |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston |year=2011 |isbn=978-0205763139 |edition=9th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of sub-fields which overlap with gerontology. There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an [[Population ageing|ageing population]] on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer's disease. As an academic discipline the field is relatively new. The USC Leonard Davis School created the first PhD, master's and bachelor's degree programs in gerontology in 1975.

==History==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and remedies for problems including [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=Howell87&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic physician [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]] Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly (Ammar 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ammar |first1= S |year= 1998 |title= Vesalius |journal= Official Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine |volume= 4 |page= 48 |url= http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/ishm/vesalius/VESx1998x04x01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly work covers [[sleep disorder]]s, [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]], how to strengthen [[memory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/bioI.html#jazzar |title=Ibn al-Jazzār, Abū Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Abī Khālid (d. 979/369) |work=Islamic Medical Manuscripts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Geritt Bos, ''Ibn al-Jazzar'', ''Risala fi l-isyan'' (Treatise on forgetfulness), London, 1995 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and causes of [[Death|mortality]]&lt;ref name="Al Jazzar"&gt;[http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm Al Jazzar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706155736/http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ishaq ibn Hunayn]] (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_08.html |title=Specialized literature |work=Islamic culture and medical arts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of aged humans, and the [[life expectancy]], tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Some early pioneers, such as [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. [[Élie Metchnikoff]] coined the term "gerontology" {{circa}} 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gerontology Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pioneers like [[James Birren]] began organizing gerontology as its own field in the 1940s, later being involved in starting a US government agency on aging &amp;ndash; the [[National Institute on Aging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Institute on Aging|url=https://www.nia.nih.gov/about|publisher=National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; programs in gerontology at the [[University of Southern California]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and as past president of the [[Gerontological Society of America]] (founded in 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Beth|title=In memoriam: James E.

With the population of people over 60 years old expected to be some 22% of the world's population by 2050, assessment and treatment methods for age-related disease burden &amp;ndash; the term ''geroscience'' emerged in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4036419|year=2014|author1=Burch|first1=J.

==Aging demographics==
The world is forecast to undergo rapid [[aging population|population aging]] in the next several decades.  In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States and across the world, the [[Baby boomers|"baby boomer"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web |author=Carrie A. Werner |title=The Older Population: 2010 |year=2010 |work=2010 Census Briefs |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-09.pdf |id=C2010BR-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that 25% of the population in the United States and [[Canada]] will be aged 65 years and older by 2025.  Moreover, by 2050, it is predicted that, for the first time in United States history, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will be greater than the number of children aged 0 to 14 years.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;  Those aged 85 years and older (oldest-old) are projected to increase from 5.3 million to 21 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Population |chapterurl=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/2008_Documents/Population.aspx |title=2008 Older Americans : Key indicators of Well-Being |year=2008 |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/Data_2008.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adults aged 85–89 years constituted the greatest segment of the oldest-old in 1990, 2000, and 2010.  However, the largest percentage point increase among the oldest-old occurred in the 90- to 94-year-old age group, which increased from 25.0% in 1990 to 26.4% in 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

With the rapid growth of the aging population, social work education and training specialized in older adults and practitioners interested in working with older adults are increasingly in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute for Geriatric Social Work |publisher=Boston University |url=http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711073154/http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geriatric Social Work Initiative |url=http://www.gswi.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences with age ===

There has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States.  In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

=== Geographic distribution of older adults ===
The number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

== Biogerontology ==
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|The hand of an older adult]]
{{Main|Theories of aging}}
Biogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process. It involves interdisciplinary research on biological aging's causes, effects, and mechanisms.  Conservative biogerontologists such as [[Leonard Hayflick]] have predicted that the human life expectancy will peak at about 92 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watts G |title=Leonard Hayflick and the limits of ageing |journal=Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9783 |page=2075 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21684371 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60908-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(11)60908-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as [[James Vaupel]] have predicted that in industrialized countries, life expectancies will reach 100 for children born after the year 2000.&lt;ref name=Christensen2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christensen|first1=L|last2=Doblhammer|first2=K|last3=Rau|first3=G|last4=Vaupel|first4=JW|title=Ageing populations: the challenges ahead|journal=Lancet|date=2009|volume=374|issue=9696|pages=1196–1208|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)61460-4|pmid=19801098|pmc=2810516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some surveyed biogerontologists have predicted life expectancies of two or more centuries.&lt;ref name=Richel2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richel|first1=Theo|title=Will human life expectancy quadruple in the next hundred years? Sixty gerontologists say public debate on life extension is necessary|journal=J Anti-Aging Med|date=December 2003|volume=6|issue=4|pages=309–314|doi=10.1089/109454503323028902|pmid=15142432}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Aubrey de Grey]] offering the "tentative timeframe" that with adequate funding of research to develop interventions in aging such as [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence]], "we have a 50/50 chance of developing technology within about 25 to 30 years from now that will, under reasonable assumptions about the rate of subsequent improvements in that technology, allow us to stop people from dying of aging at any age", leading to life expectancies of 1,000 years.&lt;ref name=deGreyRae2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Grey|first1=Aubrey D. N. J.|last2=Rae|first2=Michael|authorlink1=Aubrey de Grey|title=Ending Aging|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=978-0312367077|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biomedical gerontology]], also known as experimental gerontology and [[life extension]], is a sub-discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Most "[[Anti-aging movement|life extensionists]]" believe the human life span can be increased within the next century, if not sooner. Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try. Geroscience is a recently formulated interdisciplinary field that embraces biomedical gerontology as the center of preventing [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] through science.&lt;ref name="Lithgow2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lithgow|first1=Gordon J.|authorlink1=Gordon J. Lithgow|title=Origins of Geroscience|journal=Public Policy &amp; Aging Report|date=1 September 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=10–11|doi=10.1093/ppar/23.4.10|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with biogerontology, which aims to prevent age-related disease by intervening in aging processes, geriatrics is a field of medicine that studies the treatment of existing disease in aging people.

There are numerous theories of aging, and no one theory has been accepted. There is a wide spectrum of the types of theories for the causes of aging with programmed theories on one extreme and error theories on the other. Regardless of the theory, a commonality is that as humans age, functions of the body decline.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |first1=Albert W. |last1=Taylor |first2=Michel J. |last2=Johnson |title=Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGtzfxkFhwC |year=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-7360-5838-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stochastic theories ===
Stochastic theories of aging is the suggestion that aging is caused by small changes in the body over time and the body's failure to restore the system and mend the damages to the body. The cells and tissues are eventually injured due to the damage gathered over time. This causes the diminishes in an organ's function related to age. The notion of accumulated damage was first introduced by Weisman as the "wear and tear" theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipsky|first1=Martin S.|last2=King|first2=Mitch|title=Biological theories of aging|journal=Disease-a-Month|date=2015|volume=61|issue=11|pages=460–466|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2015.09.005|pmid=26490576|url=http://www.diseaseamonth.com/article/S0011-5029(15)00146-7/abstract|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wear and tear theory====

Wear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of [[Insult (medical)|insults]] which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

==== Accumulation ====
Accumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt; An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.

==== Free radical theory ====
[[Free radicals]] are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage. The [[free-radical theory of aging]] proposes that this damage cumulatively degrades the biological function of cells and impacts the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boniewska-Bernacka|first=Ewa|date=2016|title=Selected Theories of Ageing|url=https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/11286/Boniewska.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Higher School's Pulse|volume=10|pages=36–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that free radicals are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenn|first=Rebecca|author2=Gilbert, DL, Nye, SW, Dwyer, P, and Fenn WO|title=Oxygen poisoning and x-irradiation: a mechanism in common|journal=Science|date=7 May 1954|volume=119|issue=3097|pages=623–626|pmid=13156638|bibcode=1954Sci...119..623G|doi=10.1126/science.119.3097.623 |last3=Nye|first3=Sylvanus W.|last4=Dwyer|first4=Peter|last5=Fenn|first5=Wallace O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but came to prominence in 1956, when [[Denham Harman]] proposed the free-radical theory of aging and even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harman|first=D|title=The aging process|journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |date=September 1993 |volume=90 |issue=17|pages=7915–7922 |pmid=8367443|pmc=47258|bibcode=1993PNAS...90.7915A|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.17.7915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckman|first=KB|author2=Ames BN|title=The free radial theory of aging matures|journal=Physiol Rev|date=April 1998|volume=78|issue=2|pages=547–581|pmid=9562038 |doi=10.1152/physrev.1998.78.2.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.

==== DNA damage theory ====

DNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by [[Gioacchino Failla]] in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Failla|first=G|title=The aging process and cancerogenesis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 1958|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1124–1140|pmid=13583876|bibcode=1958NYASA..71.1124F|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1958.tb46828.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist [[Leó Szilárd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szilard|first=Leo|title=On the nature of the aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=January 1959|volume=45|issue=1|pages=30–45|pmid=16590351|pmc=222509|doi=10.1073/pnas.45.1.30|bibcode=1959PNAS...45...30S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freitas|first=AA|author2=de Magalhaes, JP|title=A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing|journal=Mutat Res|date=Jul–Oct 2011|volume=728|issue=1–2|pages=12–22|pmid=21600302|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-linking theory====

The cross-linking theory proposes that [[advanced glycation end-product]]s (stable bonds formed by the binding of glucose to proteins) and other aberrant [[cross-links]] accumulating in aging tissues is the cause of aging. The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. [[Crosslinking of DNA]] can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Genetic ===
Genetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a "biological clock" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]], which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Horvath S |title=

=== General imbalance ===
General imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the [[Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;

====Immunological theory====

The immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and [[Neoplasm|neoplastic cells]]. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social gerontology ==
Social gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[demography]], [[public health]], or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.

Because issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.

=== Social theories of aging ===
Several theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&amp;pg=PA68 |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Peace |editor2-first=S.

==== Activity theory ====
[[Activity theory (aging)|Activity theory]] was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Activity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, [[post-industrial society]], which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.&lt;ref name="allnurses-breakroom.com"&gt;VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disengagement theory ====
[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose "ego-energy" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.

==== Continuity theory ====
[[Continuity theory]] is an elusive concept. On one hand,
to exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to
be uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.
This static view of continuity is not very applicable
to human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic
view of continuity starts with the idea of a basic
structure which persists over time, but it allows for a
variety of changes to occur within the context provided
by the basic structure. The basic structure is
coherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts
that is recognizably unique and that allows us to
differentiate that structure from others. With the
introduction of the concept of time, ideas such as
direction, sequence, character development, and
story line enter into the concept of continuity as it is
applied to the evolution of a human being. In this
theory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed
and applied to the issue of adaptation to normal
aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=978-0803918047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central premise of continuity theory is that, in
making adaptive choices, middle-aged and older
adults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal
and external structures and that they prefer to
accomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,
applying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).
In middle and later life, adults are drawn by the
weight of past experience to use continuity as a
primary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes
associated with normal aging. To the extent that
change builds upon, and has links to, the person's
past, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both
their own perceptions and pressures from the social
environment, individuals who are adapting to normal
aging are both predisposed and motivated
toward inner psychological continuity as well as outward
continuity of social behavior and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=978-0471338604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuity theory views both internal and
external continuity as robust adaptive strategies that
are supported by both individual preference and
social sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general
adaptive principles that people who are normally 
aging could be expected to follow, explanations of
how these principles work, and a specification of
general areas of life in which these principles could
be expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory
has enormous potential as a general theory of
adaptation to individual aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age stratification theory ====
According to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s that define "age strata". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

==== Life course theory ====
According to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993),&lt;ref name=life&gt;Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Also reflecting the life course focus,
consider the implications for how societies might function when age-based
norms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—
and suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging
and the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,
morbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the
organization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and
leisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new
ways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as
well, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need
to be reconceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rowe, J.W. |author2=Kahn, R.L. |title=Successful aging |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0375400452 }}&lt;br&gt;Webster, N. (2003). Webster's new American dictionary. New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory ====
According to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer,&lt;ref name=Dennefer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dannefer D |title=Cumulative advantage/disadvantage and the life course: cross-fertilizing age and social science theory |journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=S327–37 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14614120 |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.6.S327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Environmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. |author2=Rodriguez-Rodriguez, V. |title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America. Policies and perspectives on environment and aging|year=2016|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-3-319-21418-4|page=284|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rowles, Graham D. |author2=Bernard, Miriam|title=Environmental Gerontology: Making Meaningful Places in Old Age|year=2013|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826108135|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scheidt, Rick J. |author2=Schwarz, Benyamin|title=Environmental Gerontology. What Now?|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-62616-3|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field emerged in the 1930s during the first studies on behavioral and social gerontology. In the 1970s and 1980s, research confirmed the importance of the physical and social environment in understanding the aging population and improved the quality of life in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wahl, H-W. |author2=Scheidt, R.J. |author3=Windley, P.G. |title=Annual Review of Gerontology and Geriatrics. Focus on Aging context: Socio-Physical Environments|year=2004|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826117342|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies of environmental gerontology indicate that older people prefer to age in their immediate environment, whereas spatial experience and place attachment are important for understanding the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrews, GJ.  |author2=Phillips, DR.|title=Ageing and Place: Perspectives, Policy, Practice|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415481656|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research indicates that the physical-social environment is related to the [[longevity]] and [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]. Precisely, the [[natural environment]] (such as natural therapeutic [[landscapes]], [[therapeutic garden]]) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 |issue=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography.

== Jurisprudential gerontology ==
Jurisprudential gerontology (sometimes referred to as "geriatric jurisprudence") is a specialization within gerontology that looks into the ways laws and legal structures interact with the aging experience. The field started from legal scholars in the field of [[elder law]], which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as [[therapeutic jurisprudence]], jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, [[End-of-life care|end of life]] care, or [[Nursing home residents' rights|nursing homes]] regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mlv15&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Therapeutic Jurisprudence and End-of-Life Medical Care: Physician Perceptions of a Statute's Impact Medical Law 15 Medicine and Law 1996|pages=201–17|journal=Medicine and Law|volume=15|issue=2|access-date=2018-03-20|year=1996|last1=Kapp|first1=Marshall B.|pmid=8908972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well being of older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doron|first=Israel|last2=Meenan|first2=Helen|date=2012|title=Time for Geriatric Jurisprudence|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/335324|journal=Gerontology|language=english|volume=58|issue=3|pages=193–6|doi=10.1159/000335324|pmid=22538767|issn=0304-324X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[human biology]], '''handedness''' is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the '''dominant hand'''; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the '''non-dominant hand'''.&lt;ref name= indiana&gt;Holder, M.K.

== Types ==
* ''Right-handedness'' is the most common type. Right-handed people are more skillful with their right hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest 70–95% of the world's population is right-handed.&lt;ref name="sciamerican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-are-more-people-right|title=Why are more people right-handed?|accessdate=2008-04-14 |work=Scientific American |year=1997 |author=Holder, M. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Left-handedness'' is far less common than right-handedness. Left-handed people are more skillful with their left hands when performing tasks. Studies suggest that approximately 10% of the world population is left-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hardyck C, Petrinovich LF |title=Left-handedness |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=385–404 |year=1977 |pmid=859955|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.84.3.385}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Cross-dominance]] or mixed-handedness'' is the change of hand preference between tasks. This is very uncommon in the population with about a 1% prevalence.&lt;ref name= annett&gt;{{cite book |last=Annett |first=Marian |year=2002 |title=Handedness and Brain Asymmetry | publisher = Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Ambidexterity]]'', equal ability to use both hands, is exceptionally rare, although it can be learned.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A completely ambidextrous person is able to do any task equally well with either hand. Those who learn it still tend to favor their originally dominant hand.&lt;ref name=indiana/&gt;

== Causes ==
There are several theories of how handedness develops in individual humans. Occurrences during prenatal development may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393204002428|title=Prenatal thumb sucking is related to postnatal handedness|publisher= | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.08.009|volume=43|journal=Neuropsychologia|pages=313–315|year=2005 | last1 = Hepper | first1 = Peter G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson EL, Campbell JM, Michel GF | year = 2013 | title = Unimanual to bimanual: Tracking the development of handedness from 6 to 24 months | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–188 | pmc=3615031 | doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2013.01.009 | pmid=23454419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Division of labor ===
One common theory as to how handedness affects the hemispheres is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

=== Genetic factors ===
Handedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed.&lt;ref name="McManusChris"&gt;{{cite book | author=McManus, Chris | title=Right Hand, Left Hand | publisher=Phoenix Paperbacks | year=2003 | isbn=0753813556}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al. (2006) has indicated that the [[heritability]] of handedness is roughly 24%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393208003722|title=Genetic influences on handedness: Data from 25,732 Australian and Dutch twin families|publisher= | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.09.005|volume=47|journal=Neuropsychologia|pages=330–337|pmid=18824185|pmc=2755095|date=January 2009 | last1 = Medland | first1 = SE | last2 = Duffy | first2 = DL | last3 = Wright | first3 = MJ | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the growing weight of evidence from [[genetic linkage|linkage]] and [[genome-wide association study|genome-wide association]] studies suggests that genetic variance in handedness cannot be explained by a single genetic [[Locus (genetics)|locus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francks|first=C|author2=DeLisi, LE |author3=Fisher, SE |author4=Laval, SH |author5=Rue, JE |author6=Stein, JF |author7= Monaco, AP |title=Confirmatory evidence for linkage of relative hand skill to 2p12-q11|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=February 2003|volume=72|issue=2|pages=499–502|pmid=12596796|doi=10.1086/367548|pmc=379245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Francks C, Maegawa S, Laurén J, Abrahams BS, Velayos-Baeza A, Medland SE, Colella S, Groszer M, McAuley EZ, Caffrey TM, Timmusk T, Pruunsild P, Koppel I, Lind PA, Matsumoto-Itaba N, Nicod J, Xiong L, Joober R, Enard W, Krinsky B, Nanba E, Richardson AJ, Riley BP, Martin NG, Strittmatter SM, Möller HJ, Rujescu D, St Clair D, Muglia P, Roos JL, Fisher SE, Wade-Martins R, Rouleau GA, Stein JF, Karayiorgou M, Geschwind DH, Ragoussis J, Kendler KS, Airaksinen MS, Oshimura M, DeLisi LE, Monaco, AP |title=LRRTM1 on chromosome 2p12 is a maternally suppressed gene that is associated paternally with handedness and schizophrenia |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |date=December 2007 |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=1129–39, 1057 |pmid=17667961 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4002053 |pmc=2990633}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Agtmael|first=T|author2=Forrest, SM |author3=Williamson, R |title=Parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis of several candidate regions for genes for human handedness|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=October 2002|volume=10|issue=10|pages=623–30|pmid=12357333|doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5200851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=Diane M.|author2=Stern, Michael |author3=Duggirala, Ravindranath |author4=Dyer, Thomas D. |author5= Almasy, Laura |title=Heritability and linkage analysis of hand, foot, and eye preference in Mexican Americans|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|date=1 November 2006|volume=11|issue=6|pages=508–524|doi=10.1080/13576500600761056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laval SH, Dann JC, Butler RJ, Loftus J, Rue J, Leask SJ, Bass N, Comazzi M, Vita A, Nanko S, Shaw S, Peterson P, Shields G, Smith AB, Stewart J, DeLisi LE, Crow TJ|title=Evidence for linkage to psychosis and cerebral asymmetry (relative hand skill) on the X chromosome|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|date=September 7, 1998|volume=81|issue=5|pages=420–7|pmid=9754628|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19980907)81:5&lt;420::AID-AJMG11&gt;3.0.CO;2-E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armour|first=JA|author2=Davison, A |author3=McManus, IC |title=Genome-wide association study of handedness excludes simple genetic models.|journal=Heredity|date=Sep 25, 2013|pmid=24065183|doi=10.1038/hdy.2013.93|volume=112|issue=3|pages=221–5|pmc=3931166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eriksson|first=N|author2=Macpherson, JM |author3=Tung, JY |author4=Hon, LS |author5=Naughton, B |author6=Saxonov, S |author7=Avey, L |author8=Wojcicki, A |author9=Pe'er, I |author10= Mountain, J |title=Web-based, participant-driven studies yield novel genetic associations for common traits.|journal=PLOS Genetics|date=Jun 24, 2010|volume=6|issue=6|pages=e1000993|pmid=20585627|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000993|pmc=2891811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scerri|first=TS|author2=Brandler, WM |author3=Paracchini, S |author4=Morris, AP |author5=Ring, SM |author6=Richardson, AJ |author7=Talcott, JB |author8=Stein, J |author9= Monaco, AP |title=PCSK6 is associated with handedness in individuals with dyslexia.|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|date=Feb 1, 2011|volume=20|issue=3|pages=608–14|pmid=21051773|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddq475|pmc=3016905}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these studies McManus et al. now conclude that handedness is [[polygenic]] and estimate that at least 40 [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] contribute to determining this trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus|first=IC|author2=Davison, A |author3=Armour, JA |title=Multilocus genetic models of handedness closely resemble single-locus models in explaining family data and are compatible with genome-wide association studies.|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=June 2013|volume=1288|pages=48–58|pmid=23631511|doi=10.1111/nyas.12102|issue=1|pmc=4298034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandler et al. performed a [[genome-wide association study]] for a measure of relative hand skill and found that genes involved in the determination of left/right asymmetry in the body play a key role in determining handedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brandler WM, Morris AP, Evans DM, Scerri TS, Kemp JP, Timpson NJ, St Pourcain B, Smith GD, Ring SM, Stein J, Monaco AP, Talcott JB, Fisher SE, Webber C, Paracchini S |title=Common variants in left/right asymmetry genes and pathways are associated with relative hand skill.|journal=PLOS Genetics|date=September 2013|volume=9|issue=9|pages=e1003751|pmid=24068947|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003751|pmc=3772043}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest the same mechanisms that determine left/right asymmetry in the body (e.g. [[Nodal signaling]] and [[ciliogenesis]]) also play a role in the development of brain asymmetry (handedness is an outward reflection of brain asymmetry for motor function).

=== Epigenetic factors ===

[[Twin study|Twin studies]] indicate that genetic factors explain 25% of the variance in handedness, while environmental factors explain the remaining 75%.&lt;ref name="Medland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Medland | first1 = SE | last2 = Duffy | first2 = DL | last3 = Wright | first3 = MJ | last4 = Geffen | first4 = GM | last5 = Martin | first5 = NG | date = Feb 2006 | title = Handedness in twins: joint analysis of data from 35 samples | url = | journal = Twin Res Hum Genet | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 46–53 | doi=10.1375/183242706776402885}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the molecular basis of handedness [[epigenetics]] is largely unclear,  Ocklenburg et al. 2017 found that asymmetric [[DNA methylation|methylation]] of [[CpG site]]s plays a key role for [[gene expression]] asymmetries that have been related to handedness.&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = T | last2 = Collura | first2 = RV | last3 = Ruvolo | first3 = M | last4 = Walsh | first4 = CA | date = Jul 2006 | title = Genomic and evolutionary analyses of asymmetrically expressed genes in human fetal left and right cerebral cortex | url = | journal = Cereb Cortex | volume = 16 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = i18–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ocklenburg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ocklenburg | first1 = S | last2 = Schmitz | first2 = J | last3 = Moinfar | first3 = Z | last4 = Moser | first4 = D | last5 = Klose | first5 = R | last6 = Lor | first6 = S | last7 = Kunz | first7 = G | last8 = Tegenthoff | first8 = M | last9 = Faustmann | first9 = P | last10 = Francks | first10 = C | last11 = Epplen | first11 = JT | last12 = Kumsta | first12 = R | last13 = Güntürkün | first13 = O | date = Feb 2017 | title = Epigenetic regulation of lateralized fetal spinal gene expression underlies hemispheric asymmetries | url = | journal = eLife | volume =  6| issue = | page =  | doi = 10.7554/eLife.22784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prenatal hormone exposure ===
Four studies have indicated that individuals who have had in-utero exposure to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (a synthetic [[estrogen]] based medication used between 1940 and 1971) were more likely to be left-handed over the clinical control group. Diethylstilbestrol animal studies "suggest that estrogen affects the developing brain, including the part that governs sexual behavior and right and left dominance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Titus-Ernstoff|first=L.|authorlink=Linda Titus-Ernstoff|title=Psychosexual Characteristics of Men and Women Exposed Prenatally to Diethylstilbestrol|journal=CDC|year=2003 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/des/consumers/research/recent_psychosexual.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheirs JG1, Vingerhoets AJ.|title=Handedness and other laterality indices in women prenatally exposed to DES|journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol|date=1995|pmid=8557813|doi=10.1080/01688639508405162|volume=17|pages=725–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter SC|title=Handedness in women with intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=1994|pmid=8084419|volume=32|pages=619–23|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(94)90149-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith LL1, Hines M.|title=Language lateralization and handedness in women prenatally exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES).|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=2000|volume=25|issue=5|pmid=10818283|pages=497–512|doi=10.1016/s0306-4530(00)00005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prenatal vestibular asymmetry ===
Previc, after reviewing a large number of studies, found evidence that the position of the fetus in the final trimester and a baby's subsequent birth position can affect handedness. About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,&lt;ref&gt;Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.&lt;/ref&gt; and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994–1007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultrasound ===
Another theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy. Research on this topic suggests there may exist a weak association between [[Obstetrical ultrasonography|ultrasound screening]] (sonography used to check on the healthy development of the fetus and mother during pregnancy) and left-handedness.&lt;ref name="Salvesen 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salvesen|first=K. Å.|title=Ultrasound in pregnancy and non-right handedness: meta-analysis of randomized trials|journal=Ultrasound in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|date=1 September 2011|volume=38|issue=3|pages=267–271|doi=10.1002/uog.9055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Handedness developmental timeline ==
Infants have been known to fluctuate heavily when choosing a hand to lead in grasping and object manipulation tasks. This is especially shown when observing hand dominance in one versus two-handed grasping tasks. Between 36 and 48 months, variability between handedness in one handed grasping begins to decline significantly. This difference can be seen earlier in bi-manual manipulation tasks. Children aged 18 to 36 months showed more hand preference when performing bi-manipulation tasks than simple grasping.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fagard|first=Jacqueline|last2=Lockman|first2=Jeffrey J.|title=The effect of task constraints on infants' (bi)manual strategy for grasping and exploring objects|journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28|issue=3|pages=305–315 |doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.05.005|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease in handedness variability for 36-to-48-month-old children could likely be attributed to preschool or kindergarten attendance. The increase in required single hand grasping activities such as writing or coloring can force children to develop a hand preference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Correlation with other factors ==

=== Intelligence ===
{{further|Handedness and mathematical ability|List of musicians who play left-handed}}
In his book ''Right-Hand, Left-Hand'', Chris McManus of [[University College London]] argues that the proportion of left-handers is increasing and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] Accessed June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.&lt;ref&gt;Chris McManus. April 14, 2012. Is It True That Left-Handed People Are Smarter Than Right-Handed People? ''Scientific American.'' Retrieved: 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conversely, Joshua Goodman found evidence that left-handers were overrepresented amongst high end of the cognitive spectrum was weak due to methodological and sampling issues in conducted studies. Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children.&lt;ref name="Goodman 193–212"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.28.4.193|title=The Wages of Sinistrality: Handedness, Brain Structure, and Human Capital Accumulation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=Fall 2014 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=193–212 |doi=10.1257/jep.28.4.193 |last=Goodman|first=Joshua|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Ntolka and Papadatou-Pastou in a systematic review and meta-analysis found that it is right-handers who have higher IQ scores, but this difference is negligible (about 1.5 points). &lt;ref name="Ntolka &amp; Papadatou-Pastou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763417300210|title=Right-handers have negligibly higher IQ scores than left-handers: Systematic review and meta-analyses|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=2018 |volume=84|pages=376-393 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.08.007 |last1=Ntolka|first1=Eleni|last2=Papadatou-Pastou|first2=Marietta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early childhood intelligence ====
Nelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18–24 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of its right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), it was more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F. Michel, Early handedness in infancy predicts language ability in toddlers. Developmental Psychology, 2014. 50(3): p. 809-814.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers used [[Bayley scales of infant development|Bayley scales]] of infant and toddler development to assess all the subjects.

If handedness is entirely genetic, these health problems mean left-handness could be eliminated through natural selection.

=== Income ===
In a 2006 U.S. study, researchers from [[Lafayette College]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] concluded that there was no statistically significant correlation between handedness and earnings for the general population, but among college-educated people, left-handers earned 10 to 15% more than their right-handed counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Waldfogel, Joel (August 16, 2006). [http://www.slate.com/id/2147842 "Sinister and Rich: The evidence that lefties earn more"]. ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in a 2014 study published by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]] economist Joshua Goodman finds that left-handed people earn 10 to 12 percent less over the course of their lives than right-handed people. Goodman attributes this disparity to higher rates of emotional and behavioral problems in left-handed people.&lt;ref name="Goodman 193–212"/&gt;

=== Left-handedness and sports ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
{{See also|Southpaw stance}}
Interactive sports such as table tennis, badminton and cricket have an overrepresentation of left-handedness, while non-interactive sports such as swimming show no overrepresentation. Smaller physical distance between participants increases the overrepresentation. In [[fencing]], about half the participants are left-handed.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Diana Widermann, Robert A.

Other, sports-specific factors may [[Confounding|increase or decrease]] the advantage left-handers usually hold in one-on-one situations:
* In [[cricket]], the overall advantage of a bowler's left-handedness exceeds that resulting from experience alone: even disregarding the experience factor (''i.e.'', even for a batsman whose experience against left-handed bowlers equals his experience against right-handed bowlers), a left-handed bowler challenges the [[Mode (statistics)|average]] (''i.e.'', right-handed) batsman more than a right-handed bowler does, because the angle of a bowler's delivery to an opposite-handed batsman is much more penetrating than that of a bowler to a same-handed batsman (see [[Wasim Akram]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
* In [[baseball]], a right-handed pitcher's [[curve ball]] will break away from a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical [[batting average]]s show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed pitchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/split.cgi?t=b&amp;lg=MLB&amp;year=2012#plato |title=2012 Major League Baseball Batting Splits |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=6 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-advantage-of-batting-left-handed/ |title=The advantage of batting left-handed |publisher= hardballtimes.com |accessdate=7 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in [[Major League Baseball]] history have been posted by left-handed batters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/batting_avg_career.shtml |title=Career Leaders &amp; Records for Batting Average |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=6 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls.&lt;ref name="First Base Pickoffs for Lefty Pitchers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baseball.isport.com/baseball-guides/first-base-pickoffs-for-lefty-pitchers |title=First Base Pickoffs for Lefty Pitchers |publisher=isport.com |accessdate=7 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because a left-handed pitcher faces first base when he is in position to throw to the batter, whereas a right-handed pitcher has his back to first base, a left-handed pitcher has an advantage when attempting to [[pickoff]] baserunners at first base.&lt;ref name="First Base Pickoffs for Lefty Pitchers"/&gt;
* Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is considered an advantage for [[first basemen]] because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and because they do not have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another [[infielder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/sports/baseball/29score.html?_r=0 |author=Miller, Stuart |title=The Decline of Left-Handed First Basemen |publisher=nytimes.com |accessdate=7 March 2013 |date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate.&lt;ref name="Left Handed Catchers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bb_catchers.tripod.com/catchers/catchleft.htm |title=Left Handed Catchers |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers |accessdate=7 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous time tagging out a [[baserunner]] trying to score.&lt;ref name="Left Handed Catchers"/&gt; With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision.&lt;ref name="Left Handed Catchers"/&gt; On the other hand, the Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers states:&lt;ref name="Left Handed Catchers"/&gt;
{{Quote
|text=One advantage is a left-handed catcher's ability to frame a right-handed pitcher's breaking balls.

* In [[four wall handball]], typical strategy is to play along the left wall forcing the opponent to use their left hand to counter the attack and playing into the strength of a left-handed competitor.
* In [[water polo]] the centre forward position has an advantage in turning to shoot on net when rotating the reverse direction as expected by the centre of the opposition defence and gain an improved position to score.
* [[Ice hockey]] typically uses a strategy in which a [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defence pairing]] includes one left-handed and one right-handed defender. A disproportionately large number of ice hockey players of all positions, 62 percent, shoot left, though this does not necessarily indicate left-handedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalohockeybeat.com/depleted-sabres-defense-thrives/|title=Depleted Sabres defense thrives|last=Hoppe|first=Bill|work=Buffalo Hockey Beat|publisher=Olean Times Herald|date=January 23, 2017|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[American football]], the handedness of a [[quarterback]] affects blocking patterns on the [[offensive line]]. [[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's "blind side," is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].

=== Gender ===
According to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.&lt;ref name="Papadatou"/&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2018}}

A number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumière ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575–592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}&lt;/ref&gt; though findings are mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A 2001 study also found that children who were assigned male at birth but have different [[Gender identity|gender identities]] were more than twice as likely to be left-handed than a clinical [[control group]] (19.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zucker KJ, Beaulieu N, Bradley SJ, Grimshaw GM, Wilcox A |title=Handedness in boys with gender identity disorder |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=767–776 |year=2001 |pmid=11583249 |doi= 10.1111/1469-7610.00773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paraphilia]]s (atypical sexual interests) have also been linked to higher rates of left-handedness. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 males found "elevated paraphilic interests were correlated with elevated non-right handedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rahman Q, Symeonides DJ | first1 = Q. | last2 = Symeonides | first2 = D.

== In culture ==
{{Main|Bias against left-handed people}}
Many tools and procedures are designed to facilitate use by right-handed people, often without realizing the difficulties incurred by the left-handed. John W. Santrock has written, "For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers."&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, John W. (2008). Motor, Sensory, and Perceptual Development. Mike Ryan [Ed.], ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''(pgs.172–205). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

McManus noted that, beginning at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]], workers needed to operate complex machines that were almost certainly designed with right-handers in mind. This would have made left-handers more visible and at the same time appear less capable and more clumsy. During this era, children were taught to write with a [[dip pen]]. While a right-hander could smoothly drag the pen across paper from left to right, a dip pen could not easily be pushed across by the left hand without digging into the paper and making blots and stains.&lt;ref&gt;McManus, IC. [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-education/publications/reprints2009/2009-History_GeographyOfHumanHandedness.pdf The history and geography of human handedness.] In: Language Lateralization and Psychosis, Iris E. C. Sommer and René S. Kahn. eds. Cambridge Univ. Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative appeal===

Moreover, apart from inconvenience, left-handed people have historically been considered unlucky or even malicious for their difference by the right-handed majority. In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative. The Latin adjective ''sinister'' means "left" as well as "unlucky", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English word "sinister" (only when referring to the bearer's left of a coat of arms).

There are many negative connotations associated with the phrase "left-handed": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A "left-handed compliment" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both "left" and "awkward" or "clumsy", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to "adroit") means both "right" and "straight", as well as "law" and the legal sense of "right". The name "Dexter" derives from the Latin for "right", as does the word "dexterity" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.

[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the "[[left-hand path]]".

Until very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were strongly encouraged to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right – and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle für Linkshänder und umge-schulte Linkshänder].

=== International Left-Handers Day ===
{{main|International Left-Handers Day}}
International Left-Handers Day is held annually every August 13.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.lefthandersday.com/about.html Left-Handers' Day August 13th: Celebrate your right to be left-handed]. ''lefthandersday.com''. Retrieved 12 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the Left-Handers Club in 1992, with the club itself having been founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; International Left-Handers Day is, according to the club, "an annual event when left-handers everywhere can celebrate their sinistrality (left-handedness) and increase public awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed."&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; It celebrates their uniqueness and differences, who are from seven to ten percent of the world's population. Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, "in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001- including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!"&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

== In other animals ==
[[Kangaroo]]s and other [[Macropodidae|macropod]] [[marsupial]]s have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. 'True' handedness is unexpected in marsupials because, unlike [[Placentalia|placental mammals]], they lack a [[corpus callosum]]. Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo (''Macropus rufus'') and the eastern gray kangaroo (''Macropus giganteus''). Red-necked (Bennett's) wallabies (''Macropus rufogriseus'') preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in [[arboreal]] species.&lt;ref name="Sci-News"&gt;{{cite web |date=June 18, 2015 |title=All kangaroos are lefties, scientists say |publisher=Sci-News.com |url=http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-kangaroos-lefties-02929.html |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males are left-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callaway |first=Ewen |date=24 July 2009 |title=Is your cat left or right pawed? |website=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17510-is-your-cat-left-or-right-pawed/ |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ideal''' is a [[principle]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] that one actively pursues as a [[goal]], usually in the context of [[ethics]], and one's prioritization of ideals can serve to indicate the extent of one's dedication to each. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]], but is willing to [[lie]] to protect a friend, demonstrates not only devotion to [[friendship]], but also belief in its supersedence of honesty in importance.

The belief in ideals is called '''ethical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry into the Nature and Function of Ideals|year=1987|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=0520078888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied ethics==
In some theories of [[applied ethics]], such as that of [[Rushworth Kidder]], there is importance given to such orders as a way to [[dispute resolution|resolve disputes]].  In [[law]], for instance, a [[judge]] is sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of fairness.

==In politics==
In [[politics]] ideals play a pivotal role.  During the [[French Revolution]], the principles of "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood]]" were raised to the status of ideals. The [[Green_Party_of_the_United_States#Ideology|Ten Key Values of the US Green Party]] are likewise raised to such status today. In fact, most political movements have a certain set of ideals. However, in many cases, one can easily find instances where ideals were "not lived up to" - some of which are cases where one simply proved to outweigh another for some specific decision, or where all were compromised simply to retain the [[power (sociology)|power]] to continue to pursue them.

==Idols and heroes==
A different form of ideal is an [[idolatry|idol]] or [[hero]], who is held up as a [[moral example]].  Since this is an actual person or fictional character, it is too complex and multi-faceted to be considered an ideal in the abstract sense. However, when they are encountered in the form of a story, with only a few traits on display, they are a simplified [[archetype]] from which one can very easily derive [[stereotype]]s or mimicry.  In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of [[Muhammad]] is held up as "ideal", but must be interpreted for believers through the tale of his life, or [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]], and his many sayings, the [[hadith]].

==Ideal and virtue==
Given the complexity of putting ideals into practice, and resolving conflicts between them, it is not uncommon to see them reduced to [[dogma]]. One way to avoid this, according to [[Bernard Crick]], is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a process, rather than an outcome.  His [[political virtues]] try to raise the practical habits useful in resolving disputes into ideals of their own.  A [[virtue]], in general, is an ideal that one can make a [[habituation|habit]].

==Relative ideal==
In formal axiology, [[Robert S. Hartman]] contended that being ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since we can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is. For example, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is not as "good" as a very smooth one drawn with a compass. In the world in general, each particular object ought to become more like its ideal. In [[ethics]], by analogy, each person should attempt to become more of an ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self.

'''Immortality''' is eternal [[life]], being exempt from [[death]], unending existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immortality|website=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immortality#Biological immortality|Some modern species]] may possess [[biological immortality]].

Certain scientists, [[futurist]]s, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that [[life extension]] is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or [[major trauma|physical trauma]]; although [[mind uploading]] could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282157696|title=Artificial Neural Command Theory(American English) (US)|last=Hentrich |first=Michael|date= September 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion|religious]] contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of [[God]] (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow [[divine law]]. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial [[soul]] exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of [[religion]], as well as the subject of speculation, fantasy, and debate.

==Definitions==

===Scientific===
{{main|Anti-aging movement}}
[[Life extension]] technologies promise a path to complete [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]. [[Cryonics]] holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]] and [[Planarian|planarian worms]], it is indeed possible for a creature to be [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]], it is not known if it is possible for humans.

[[Mind uploading]] is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by [[futurist]]s such as [[Ray Kurzweil]].&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kurzweil, Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology |publisher=Viking Adult |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
{{See also|Soul}}
The belief in an ''[[afterlife]]'' is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]; however, the concept of an immortal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not. The "soul" itself has different meanings and is not used in the same way in different religions and different denominations of a religion. For example, various branches of Christianity have disagreeing views on the soul's immortality and its relation to the body.

==Physical immortality==
Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as [[cryonics]], [[digital immortality]], breakthroughs in [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] or predictions of an impending [[technological singularity]], or because of a spiritual belief, such as those held by [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] or [[Rebirthing-Breathwork|Rebirthers]].

===Causes of death===
{{Main|Death}}

There are three main causes of death: [[aging]], [[disease]] and [[physical trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayflick|first=L|title=Biological Aging is No Longer an Unsolved Problem|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1100|issue=1|pages=1–13|date=2007|url=http://0-content.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/pdf19_22/pdf/2007/YQR/11Apr07/24963097.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=24963097&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeprE4v%2BbwOLCmr0qepq5Srqi4TLSWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvrki0ra9JuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|doi=10.1196/annals.1395.001|pmid=17460161|bibcode=2007NYASA1100....1H}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.

====Aging====
[[Aubrey de Grey]], a leading researcher in the field,&lt;ref name="Garreau"/&gt; defines [[aging]] as "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an adult [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death." The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), [[DNA damage theory of aging|DNA damage]], [[oncology|oncogenic]] [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[mutation]]s and [[epimutation]]s, cell [[senescence]], [[mitochondria]]l mutations, [[lysosomal]] aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, [[immune system]] decline, and [[endocrine]] changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|engineered negligible senescence]]. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) ''Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair''. Academic Press, San Diego. {{ISBN|0120928604}}  {{ISBN|978-0120928606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disease====
Disease is theoretically surmountable via [[technology]]. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of diseases functioning and disability|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human understanding of [[genetics]] is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. [[Preventative medicine]] is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] may soon be curable with the use of [[stem cells]]. Breakthroughs in [[cell biology]] and [[telomere]] research are leading to treatments for [[cancer]]. [[Vaccine]]s are being researched for [[AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Genes associated with [[type 1 diabetes]] and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the [[nervous system]] may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.

====Trauma====
[[Physical trauma]] would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of [[paramedic]] [[disaster relief operation|response]] remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=International Search and Rescue Teams, A League Discussion Paper |date=1991 |publisher=[[IFRC|League of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] |location=[[Geneva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for [[nanotechnology]], would mitigate this factor.
Being the seat of [[consciousness]], the [[brain]] cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.

====Environmental change ====
Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, you could still starve to death.

If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the [[cumulative probability]] of death over an infinite horizon is less than [[certainty]], even when the risk of fatal trauma [[Survival analysis#Hazard function and cumulative hazard function|in any finite period]] is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving "[[Indefinite lifespan#Actuarial escape velocity|actuarial escape velocity]]"

===Biological immortality===
[[File:Telomere caps.gif|thumb|right|Human [[chromosome]]s (grey) capped by telomeres (white)]]
{{Main|Biological immortality}}

Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it's the absence of a sustained increase in [[rate of mortality]] as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.

[[Biologist]]s have chosen the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not limited by the [[Hayflick limit]], where cells no longer divide because of [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is [[HeLa]], developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of [[Henrietta Lacks]] without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of [[Leonard Hayflick]], there was the erroneous belief fostered by [[Alexis Carrel]] that all normal [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a "cap" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. [[Telomerase]] is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times.&lt;ref name="LinKahWai"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lin Kah Wai |authorlink=Lin Kah Wai |title=Telomeres, Telomerase, and Tumorigenesis -- A Review |journal=MedGenMed |date=18 April 2004 |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=19 |pmid=15520642 |pmc=1435592}}&lt;/ref&gt; No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html|title=New Prospects for Growing Human Replacement Organs in Animals|website=nytimes.com|access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biologically immortal species====
{{see also|List of longest-living organisms}}

Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:
* ''[[Bacteria]]'' – Bacteria reproduce through [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]]. A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 [[PLoS Biology]] paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/08/01/54/PDF/stewart_Plos.pdf|title= Aging and Death in an Organism That Reproduces by Morphologically Symmetric Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18524855.800-bacteria-death-reduces-human-hopes-of-immortality.html |title=Bacteria Death Reduces Human Hopes of Immortality |date=February 5, 2005 |website=New Scientist magazine, issue 2485, page 19 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', a jellyfish (phylum [[Cnidaria]], class [[Hydrozoa]], order [[Anthoathecata]]), after becoming a sexually mature adult, can transform itself back into a [[polyp]] using the cell conversion process of [[transdifferentiation]].&lt;ref name="CheatingDeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of Turritopsis|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|date=2006|accessdate=2009-06-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121052612/http://10e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|archivedate=2015-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' repeats this cycle, meaning that it may have an [[indefinite lifespan]].&lt;ref name="CheatingDeath" /&gt; Its immortal adaptation has allowed it to spread from its original habitat in the Caribbean to "all over the world".&lt;ref name="Telegraph-immortal-jellyfish"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/4357829/Immortal-jellyfish-swarming-across-the-world.html |title={{-'}}Immortal' jellyfish swarming across the world |date=January 30, 2009 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate= 2009-06-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/01/090130-immortal-jellyfish-swarm.html|title="Immortal" Jellyfish Swarm World's Oceans|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Bristlecone pine]]s'' are speculated to be potentially immortal;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} the oldest known living specimen is over 5,000 years old.

====Evolution of aging====
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}&lt;!--that's how they spell aging in England ... and in that article--&gt;
As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no [[second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] from the environment and unloads its [[entropy]] as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of [[evolution]], but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere "end replication problem" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.R. 1999. ''A Means to an End: The biological basis of aging and death.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{cite web |url=http://wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511212036/http://www.wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }} About telomeres and programmed cell death.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Ch. 69, Cancer cell biology and angiogenesis, Robert G. Fenton and Dan L. Longo, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:
* Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.
* [[Pleiotropy|Antagonistic pleiotropy]] is a theory proposed as an alternative by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.C. 1957. Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence. ''Evolution'', '''11''':398-411. {{cite web|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713071204/http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-13 |df= }} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, T.B.L. 1977. Evolution of aging. ''Nature'', '''270''': 301-304. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5635/abs/270301a0.html] Origin of the disposable soma theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prospects for human biological immortality===

====Life-extending substances====
There are some known naturally occurring and artificially produced chemicals that may increase the lifetime or life-expectancy of a person or organism, such as [[resveratrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phytochemicals.info/abstracts/resveratrol-life-span.php |title=Resveratrol may increase life span |publisher=Phytochemicals.info |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=:: compound resveratrol may turn off a protein that guards cancer cells from cancer-fighting therapies |url=http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |publisher=Wordpress.rudramani.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2010-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803231526/http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[scientist]]s believe that boosting the amount or proportion of [[telomerase]] in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of [[chromosome]]s, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre ([[Madrid]]) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3489881/Scientists-take-a-step-closer-to-an-elixir-of-youth.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Scientists take a step closer to an elixir of youth |first=Richard |last=Alleyne |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their [[Hayflick limit]]. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of [[DNA]], and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.

[[Embryonic stem cells]] express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

====Technological immortality, biological machines, and  "swallowing the doctor"====
{{Main|Transhumanism}}

Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, [[biological engineering]], [[regenerative medicine]], [[microbiology]], and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of [[human cloning]], cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. [[Robert Freitas]], a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical [[nanorobot]]s could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., ''Microbivores: Artificial Mechanical Phagocytes using Digest and Discharge Protocol'', self-published, 2001 [http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Microbivores.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=The Singularity Is Near |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Cryonics====
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]], the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and [[rejuvenation (aging)|aging is reversible]]. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] which creates a glass-like state rather than [[freezing]] as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.

====Mind-to-computer uploading====
{{Main|Mind uploading}}

One idea that has been advanced involves [[Mind uploading|uploading]] an individual's habits and memories via [[direct mind-computer interface]]. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. [[Extropian]] [[futures studies|futurists]] like Moravec and [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil]] have proposed that, thanks to [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] computing power, it will someday be possible to [[mind uploading|upload human consciousness]] onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of [[identity (social science)|identity]], thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anders |first=Sandberg |last2=Nick |first2=Boström |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.'' |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2009 |series=Technical Report #2008‐3 |date=2008 |publisher=Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of [[consciousness]] in the functions of the [[mind]]. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/iva-to/on-achieving-immortality-3ed1d567f7a2|title=On Achieving Immortality|last=Ruparel|first=Bhavik|date=2018-07-30|website=Iva.to|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[neural correlates of consciousness]] is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}

====Cybernetics====
{{Main|Cyborg}}

Transforming a human into a [[cyborg]] can include [[brain implants]] or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.

As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the ''[[A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas|Syntopicon]]'' found in their compilation of the [[Great Books of the Western World]], that "The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul."&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 788"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=788 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the [[afterlife]].

===Ancient Greek religion===
Immortality in [[ancient Greek religion]] originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either [[Elysium]], the [[Islands of the Blessed]], heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were [[Amphiaraus]], [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Iphigenia]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. [[Asclepius]] was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, [[Achilles]], after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either [[Leuce (mythology)|Leuce]], the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [[Alcmene]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]] were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus' Histories]], the 7th century BC sage [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]] was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.

The philosophical idea of an [[immortal soul]] was a belief first appearing with either [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] or the [[Orphics]], and most importantly advocated by [[Plato]] and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of [[Jesus]] was not lost on the early Christians, as [[Justin Martyr]] argued: "when we say&amp;nbsp;... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." (''1 Apol.'' 21).

===Buddhism===
The goal of [[Hinayana]] is [[Arhatship]] and [[Nirvana]].  By contrast, the goal of [[Mahayana]] is [[Buddhahood]].

According to one [[Tibetan Buddhist]] teaching, [[Dzogchen]], individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the [[rainbow body]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Eternal life (Christianity)|Christian conditionalism|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 3.jpg|thumb|Adam and Eve condemned to mortality. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''Danse Macabre'', 16th century]]

[[Christianity|Christian theology]] holds that [[Adam and Eve]] lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the [[Fall of man]], although this initial "imperishability of the bodily frame of man" was "a preternatural condition".&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 784"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=784 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians who profess the [[Nicene Creed]] believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected from the dead]] at the [[Second Coming]], and this belief is known as [[Universal resurrection]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[N.T. Wright]], a theologian and former [[Bishop of Durham]], has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told [[Time (magazine)|Time]]: "Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon [[Second Coming of Christ|his return]]. Part of this will be the [[Universal resurrection|resurrection of all the dead]], who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says [[John Polkinghorne]], a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the [[Intermediate state]]) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering [[World to Come|Christ's kingdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html |work=Time |title=Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop&amp;#13; |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |first=David |last=Van Biema}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kingdom will consist of [[World to Come|Heaven and Earth "joined together in a new creation"]], he said.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Chiranjivi|Naraka (Hinduism)}}
[[File:Reincarnation AS.jpg|thumb|Representation of a soul undergoing ''punarjanma''. Illustration from ''Hinduism Today'', 2004]]

[[Hinduism|Hindus]] believe in an immortal soul which is [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called ''[[samsara]]''. If they live their life well, their ''[[karma]]'' improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss.  There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

There are explicit renderings in the [[Upanishad]]s alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death."

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
That man indeed whom these (contacts)&lt;br&gt;do not disturb, who is even-minded in&lt;br&gt;pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit&lt;br&gt;for immortality, O best of men.&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, pp 94-95 (v 15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, "Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life&amp;nbsp;... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life."&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"/&gt;

An Indian Tamil saint known as [[Vallalar]] claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallalar.org |title=vallalar.org |publisher=vallalar.org |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Fabled East: A Novel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y1RgQC-hw1MC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Vallalar+immortality+1874#v=onepage&amp;q=Vallalar%20immortality%201874&amp;f=false|author=Adam Schroeder|publisher=[[Douglas &amp; McIntyre|D &amp; M Publishers]]|page=174|isbn=9781553656159|date=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
Sikhism was found in the 15th century and over a millennium after Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, sikhs have a similar belief of immortality of reincarnation like the hindus, however they belief there is a way that we could get out of the cycle of rebirth and death, by doing the good deeds that all the ten gurus have left behind for them to do. This is like being immortal itself because once, a sikh dies he or she would live forever by being the gurus angel that may come to  earth as they please to help the world a better place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/sikhs-soul-lives-on-body-dies_n_1763220.html|title=For Sikhs, The Soul Lives On Long After The Body Dies|last=Burke|first=Daniel|date=2012-10-08|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{primary sources|date=June 2015}}
The traditional concept of an immaterial and [[Immortality of the soul|immortal soul]] distinct from the body was not found in [[Judaism]] before the [[Babylonian Exile]], but developed as a result of interaction with [[Persian philosophy|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]]. Accordingly, the Hebrew word ''[[nephesh]]'', although translated as "soul" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''Nephesh'' was rendered in the [[Septuagint]] as ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'' (''psūchê''), the Greek word for soul.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The only Hebrew word traditionally translated "soul" (''nephesh'') in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term "soul," we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.", Avery-Peck, "Soul", in Neusner, et al. (eds.), "The Encyclopedia of Judaism", p. 1343 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated "soul" ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}) has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20).}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] speaks about ''[[Sheol]]'' (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the [[Resurrection of the dead#Rabbinic and Samaritan Judaism|resurrection of the dead]]. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:1–4|ESV}} although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the [[intertestamental period]].

The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in [[Second Temple Period]]. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]].&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. “Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls” in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” &lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the [[Messianic Age]] with the coming of the [[messiah in Judaism|messiah]]. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The [[Tanakh]] is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Taoism===
{{See also|Chinese alchemy|Taoism and death|Xian (Taoism)}}

It is repeatedly stated in [[Lüshi Chunqiu]] that death is unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creel|first=Herrlee G.|title=What is Taoism? : and other studies in Chinese cultural history|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226120478|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Maspero]] noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion (University of Massachusetts Press, 1981), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a ''way of life'' than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle. Taoism: Growth of a Religion (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997 [original French 1992]), p. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Legge, James. The Texts of Taoism. 1962, Dover Press. NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
[[Zoroastrian]]s believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for "immortal" is associated with the month "Amurdad", meaning "deathless" in Persian, in the [[Iranian calendar]] (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or [[Ameretat]] is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the "Angel of Immortality" won over the "Angel of Death" in this month.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshang, Dr. Bhadha. http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727145155/http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html |date=2017-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul==

===Alcmaeon of Croton===
[[Alcmaeon of Croton]] argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.&lt;ref name="alcmaeon"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/#immort&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Phaedo#The Cyclical Argument|Cyclical Argument]], or Opposites Argument explains that [[Theory of forms|Forms]] are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.

* The [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|Theory of Recollection]] explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo.

* The [[Phaedo#The Affinity Argument|Affinity Argument]], explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.

* The [[Phaedo#The Argument from Form of Life|Argument from Form of Life]], or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

===Plotinus===
[[Plotinus]] offers a version of the argument that Kant calls "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Plotinus first argues that the soul is [[Simple (philosophy)|simple]], then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s [[Phaedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, D. (2008) "The Neoplatonic Achilles" in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metochites===
[[Theodore Metochites]] argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.&lt;ref name="metochites"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/byzantine-philosophy/#ImmSou&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna===
[[Avicenna]] argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna's Metaphysics: Al-Shifâ’, Al-Ilâhiyyât, ed. Mohammad Youssef Moussa, Solayman Dunya, Sa’id Zayed (Cairo, Organisme Général des Imprimeries Gouvernementales, 1960), II: 431–2; translated by A.J. Arberry, Aspects of Islamic Civilization (London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1964), p. 153. See too Jean R, Michot, La destinée de l’homme selon Avicenne (Louvain, Peeters, 1986), pp. 22–56, and particularly pp. 26–27, and 43; J. Janssens, “Ibn Sînâ's Ideas of ultimate Realities, Neoplatonism and the Qur’ân as Problem-Solving paradigms in the Avicennian System,” Ultimate Reality and Meaning 10 (1987), 259–261. Cf. too Michael Marmura's complete translation, Avicenna: The Metaphysics of the Healing, Provo, Utah, Brigham Young University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquinas===
The full argument for the immortality of the soul and [[Thomas Aquinas]]' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
[[René Descartes]] endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Rozemond, M. (2010). "Descartes and the Immortality of the Soul". in Mind, Method and Morality: Essays in Honor of Anthony Kenny. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz===
In early work, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his [[monadology]] he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses Mendelssohn===
[[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Phaedon]]'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue ''[[Phaedo]]'', in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, B. (2008). "Kant and Mendelssohn on the Implications of the ‘I Think’ ".in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{See also|Life extension#Ethics and politics of life extension}}

The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include [[persistent vegetative state]]s, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, [[Human enhancement#Inequality and Social Disruption|social and economic]] disparities created by [[longevity]], and survival of the [[heat death of the universe]].

===Undesirability===
Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s short story "The Mortal Immortal", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story "[[The Immortal (short story)|The Immortal]]"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book ''Thursday's Fictions'', and the stage and film adaptations of it, [[Richard James Allen]] tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poems-book/thursday-s-fictions-0371000|title=Thursday's Fictions - Richard James Allen - Poems by book - Australian Poetry Library|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the novel ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]'' depicts immortality as "falling off the wheel of life" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In the anime ''[[Casshern Sins]]'' humanity achieves immortality due to advances in medical technology; however, the inability of the human race to die causes Luna, a Messianic figure, to come forth and offer normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Ultimately, Casshern takes up the cause of death for humanity when Luna begins to restore humanity's immortality. In [[Anne Rice]]'s book series ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', [[vampire]]s are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse.

In his book ''Death'', Yale philosopher [[Shelly Kagan]] argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same—that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now—then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed—e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures—then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''Death''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 238-46. As Kagan notes, his argument is an adaptation of a similar argument given by the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] in his book ''Problems of the Self'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociology ==

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' [[social structures]]. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] shapes their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[Dossey, Larry; In: Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing; Mar/Apr2017; v.13. n.2, 81-87. 7p. (editorial) ISSN 1550-8307 {{PMID|28108110}}, Database: CINAHL Complete]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global [[demographic shift]] of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He, Goodkind, Kowal|first1=Wan, Daniel, Paul|title=An Aging World: 2015|journal=International Population Reports: U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2016|volume=1|issue=16|page=1–30|url=census.gov|accessdate=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.

== Politics ==
Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/|title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php|title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science|website=Fight Aging!|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
[[File:Ankh-Symbol.svg|right|thumb|80px|The ankh]]

There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The [[ankh]] is an [[Egypt]]ian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the [[:Category:Egyptian deities|gods]] and [[pharaoh]]s, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The [[Möbius strip]] in the shape of a [[trefoil knot]] is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the [[Ouroboros]], the Chinese fungus of longevity, the ''ten'' [[kanji]], the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the [[peacock]] in Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesuswalk.com/christian-symbols/peacock.htm |author=Wilson, Ralph F. |title=Peacock as an Ancient Christian Symbol of Eternal Life |publisher=Jesus Walk Bible Study Series |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the colors [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] (in [[Western culture]]) and [[Peach (color)|peach]] (in [[Chinese culture]]).

==Fiction==
{{Main|Immortality in fiction}}
Immortality is a popular subject in [[fiction]], as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own [[Death|mortality]]. Immortal beings and [[species]] abound in fiction, especially [[fantasy]] fiction, and the meaning of "immortal" tends to vary. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal.&lt;ref name="Garreau"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joel Garreau |authorlink=Joel Garreau |title=The Invincible Man |date=October 31, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/30/AR2007103002222_pf.html |pages=C01 |journal=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with [[Morgoth]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the Dreaming God of ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]''. Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, [[Superman]] is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: [[Kryptonite]]. (See also [[Achilles' heel]].)

Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy [[elf|elves]] often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as [[vampire]]s and the immortals in the film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', can only die from [[beheading]]. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a [[silver bullet]] (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/how-to-kill-a-vampire.html|title=How To Kill a Vampire - The Only 5 Methods Known To Man|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102231840/http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |archivedate=2012-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
'''Intra-species recognition''' is the recognition by a member of a [[species]] of a [[conspecific]] (another member of the same species).  In many species, such recognition is necessary for procreation.

Different species may employ different methods, but all of them are based on one or more [[sense]]s (after all, this is how the organism gathers information about the environment). The recognition may happen by [[chemistry|chemical]] signature ([[olfaction|smell]]), by having a distinctive shape or color ([[Visual perception|sight]]), by emitting certain sounds ([[hearing (sense)|hearing]]), or even by behaviour patterns. Often a combination of these is used.

Among [[human being]]s, the sense of sight is usually in charge of recognizing other members of the same species, with maybe the subconscious help of smell. In particular, the human [[brain]] has a disproportionate amount of processing power dedicated to finely analyze the features of a human face. This is why we are able to distinguish basically all six billions of human beings from each other (barring [[look-alike]]s), and a human being from a similar species like some anthropomorphic [[ape]], with only a quick glance.

Intra-species recognition systems are often subtle.  For example, ornithologists have great difficulty in distinguishing the [[Common chiffchaff|chiffchaff]] from the [[willow warbler]] by eye, and there is no evidence that the birds themselves can do so other than by the different [[Bird vocalization|songs]] of the male.  Sometimes, intra-species recognition is fallible: in many species of [[frog]], the males are not uncommonly seen copulating with females of the wrong species or even with inanimate objects.

''[[Heliconius charithonia]]'' displays intra-species recognition by roosting with conspecifics.  They do this with the help of UV rhodopsins in the eye that help them distinguish between ultraviolet yellow pigments and regular yellow pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Seth M., Furong Yuan, Monica D. Ramstetter, Jorge Llorente-Bousquets, Robert D. Reed, Daniel Osorio, and Adriana D. Briscoe. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adriana_Briscoe/publication/51883446_UV_Photoreceptors_and_UV-Yellow_Wing_Pigments_in_Heliconius_Butterflies_Allow_a_Color_Signal_to_Serve_both_Mimicry_and_Intraspecific_Communication/links/0912f503cdc1cbc119000000.pdf UV Photoreceptors and UV- Yellow Wing Pigments in Heliconius Butterflies Allow a Color Signal to Serve Both Mimicry and Intraspecific Communication]."

'''Kosmos 110''' ({{lang-ru|Космос 110}} meaning '''Cosmos 110''') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[spacecraft]] launched on 22 February 1966 from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] aboard a [[Voskhod rocket]]. It carried two dogs, [[Soviet space dogs#Veterok and Ugolyok|Veterok and Ugolyok]].

== Mission ==

It incorporated a re-entry body (capsule) for landing scientific instruments and test objects. It was a biological satellite that made a sustained [[biomedical]] experiment through the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] with the dogs [[Soviet space dogs#Veterok and Ugolyok|Veterok and Ugolyok]]. On March 16, after 22 days in orbit around the Earth, they were safely landed.&lt;ref&gt;NASA National Space Science Data Center: [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1966-015A Cosmos 110]&lt;/ref&gt;

This spaceflight of record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until [[Soyuz 11]] in June 1971, and still stands as the longest space flight by dogs.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The term '''laterality''' refers to the preference most [[humans]] show for one side of their [[Human body|body]] over the other. Examples include [[Handedness|left-handedness/right-handedness]] and left/right-[[footedness]]; it may also refer to the primary use of the left or right hemisphere in the brain. It may also apply to animals or plants. The majority of tests have been conducted on humans, specifically to determine the effects on language.

== Human ==

The majority of humans are [[right-handed]]. Many are also right-sided in general (that is, they prefer to use their right [[human eye|eye]], right [[foot]] and right [[ear]] if forced to make a choice between the two). The reasons for this are not fully understood, but it is thought that because the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] of the [[brain]] controls the right side of the body, the right side is generally stronger; it is suggested that the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant over the right in most humans because in 90-92% of all humans, the left hemisphere is the [[language]] hemisphere.

Human [[culture]]s are predominantly right-handed, and so the right-sided trend may be socially as well as biologically enforced. This is quite apparent from a quick survey of [[language]]s. The [[English language|English]] word "left" comes from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] word ''lyft'' which means "weak" or "useless". Similarly, the [[French language|French]] word for left, ''gauche'', is also used to mean "awkward" or "tactless", and ''sinistra'', the [[Latin]] word from which the English word "sinister" was derived, means "left". Similarly, in many cultures the word for "right" also means "correct". The English word "right" comes from the Anglo-Saxon word ''riht'' which also means "straight" or "correct."

This linguistic and social bias is not restricted to European cultures: for example, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters are designed for right-handers to write, and no significant left-handed culture has ever been found in the world.

When a person is forced to use the hand opposite of the hand that they would naturally use, this is known as ''forced laterality'', or more specifically ''forced dextrality''.  A study done by the Department of Neurology at Keele University, North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary suggests that forced dextrality may be part of the reason that the percentage of left-handed people decreases with the higher age groups, both because the effects of pressures toward right-handedness are cumulative over time (hence increasing with age for any given person subjected to them) and because the prevalence of such pressure is decreasing, such that fewer members of younger generations face any such pressure to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = E. | last4 = Joses | first4 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Is forced dextrality an explanation for the fall in the prevalence of sinistrality with age? A study in northern England | url = | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 41–44 | doi=10.1136/jech.52.1.41| pmid = 9604040 | pmc = 1756611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ambidexterity]] is when a person has approximately equal skill with both [[hand]]s and/or both sides of the body. True ambidexterity is very rare. Although a small number of people can write competently with both hands and use both sides of their body well, even these people usually show preference for one side of their body over the other. However, this preference is not necessarily consistent for all activities. Some people may for example use their right hand for [[writing]], and their [[left-handed|left hand]] for playing [[List of sports#Racket sports|racket sports]] and [[eating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oldfield | first1 = R.C. | year = 1971 | title = The assessment and analysis of handedness: The Edinburgh inventory | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 97–113 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4 | pmid=5146491}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''see also:'' [[cross-dominance]]).

Also, it is not uncommon that people preferring to use the right hand prefer to use the left leg, e.g. when using a shovel, kicking a ball, or operating control pedals. In many cases, this may be because they are disposed for left-handedness but have been trained for right-handedness. In the sport of [[cricket]], some players may find that they are more comfortable bowling with their left or right hand, but batting with the other hand.

Approximate statistics are below:&lt;ref&gt;C. Porac and S. Coren. ''Lateral preferences and human behavior''. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Favoring right hand: 88.2%
*Favoring right foot: 81.0%
*Favoring right eye: 71.1%
*Favoring right ear: 59.1%
*Same hand and foot: 84%
*Same ear and eye: 61.8%

Laterality of motor and sensory control has been the subject of a recent intense study and review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimickingman.com Mimicking Man.com.] I. Derakhshan, MD, Neurologist.&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out that the hemisphere of speech is the hemisphere of action in general and that the command hemisphere is located either in the right or the left hemisphere (never in both). Around eighty percent of people are left hemispheric for speech and the remainder are right hemispheric: ninety percent of right-handers are left hemispheric for speech, but only fifty percent of left-handers are right hemispheric for speech (the remainder are left hemispheric). The reaction time of the neurally dominant side of the body (the side opposite to the major hemisphere or the command center, as just defined) is shorter than that of the opposite side by an interval equal to the interhemispheric transfer time. Thus, one in five persons has a handedness that is the opposite for which they are wired (per laterality of command center or brainedness, as determined by reaction time study mentioned above).

===Different expressions===
* Board [[footedness]]: The stance in a board sport is not necessarily the same as the normal footedness of the person. In skateboarding and other board sports a goofy footed stance is one with the right foot leading.  A stance with the left foot forward is called regular or normal.
* Jump and spin: Direction of rotation in [[figure skating jumps]] and spins is not necessarily the same as the footedness or the handedness of each person. A skater can jump and spin counter-clockwise (the most common direction), yet be left-footed and left-handed.
* [[Ocular dominance]]:  The eye preferred when binocular vision is not possible, as through a keyhole or monocular microscope.

=== Speech ===

Cerebral dominance or specialization has been studied in relation to a variety of human functions. With speech in particular, many studies have been used as evidence that it is generally localized in the [[Cerebral hemisphere|left hemisphere]]. Research comparing the effects of lesions in the two hemispheres, [[split-brain]] patients, and perceptual asymmetries have aided in the knowledge of speech lateralization.  In one particular study, the left hemisphere’s sensitivity to differences in rapidly changing sound cues was noted (Annett, 1991).  This has real world implication, since very fine acoustic discriminations are needed to comprehend and produce speech signals.  In an electrical stimulation demonstration performed by Ojemann and Mateer (1979), the exposed [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] was mapped revealing the same cortical sites were activated in phoneme discrimination and mouth movement sequences (Annett, 1991).

As suggested by Kimura (1975, 1982), left hemisphere speech lateralization might be based upon a preference for movement sequences as demonstrated by [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) studies.  Since ASL requires intricate hand movements for language communication, it was proposed that skilled hand motions and speech require sequences of action over time. In deaf patients suffering from a left hemispheric [[stroke]] and damage, noticeable losses in their abilities to sign were noted.  These cases were compared to studies of normal speakers with dysphasias located at lesioned areas similar to the deaf patients.  In the same study, deaf patients with right hemispheric lesions did not display any significant loss of signing nor any decreased capacity for motor sequencing (Annett, 1991).

One theory, known as the acoustic laterality theory, the physical properties of certain speech sounds are what determine laterality to the left hemisphere.  Stop consonants, for example t, p, or k, leave a defined silent period at the end of words that can easily be distinguished.  This theory postulates that changing sounds such as these are preferentially processed by the left hemisphere.  As a result of the right ear being responsible for transmission to sounds to the left hemisphere, it is capable of perceiving these sounds with rapid changes.  This right ear advantage in hearing and speech laterality was evidenced in [[Dichotic listening test|dichotic listening studies]]. [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic imaging]] results from this study showed greater left hemisphere activation when actual words were presented as opposed to pseudo-words (Shtyrov, Pihko, and Pulvermuller, 2005).  Two important aspects of speech recognition are phonetic cues, such as format patterning, and prosody cues, such as intonation, accent, and emotional state of the speaker (Imaizumi, Koichi, Kiritani, Hosoi &amp; Tonoike, 1998).

In a study done with both [[Monolingualism|monolinguals]] and [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]], which took into account language experience, second language proficiency, and onset of bilingualism among other variables, researchers were able to demonstrate left hemispheric dominance.  In addition, bilinguals that began speaking a second language early in life demonstrated bilateral hemispheric involvement.  The findings of this study were able to predict differing patterns of cerebral language lateralization in adulthood (Hull &amp; Vaid, 2006).

== In other animals ==
It has been shown that cerebral lateralization is a widespread phenomenon in the [[animal|animal kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Lesley J., Andrew, Richard J. (2002) Comparative Vertebrate Lateralization, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Functional and structural differences between left and right brain hemispheres can be found in many other vertebrates and also in invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Manns"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Manns, M.  |author2=Ströckens, F.|year=2014|title=Functional and structural comparison of visual lateralization in birds–similar but still different|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|pages=206|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00206|pmid=24723898|pmc=3971188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that negative, withdrawal-associated emotions are processed predominantly by the right hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is largely responsible for processing positive, approach-related emotions.  This has been called the "laterality-[[Valence (psychology)|valence]] hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Barnard2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barnard, S., Matthews, L., Messori, S., Podaliri-Vulpiani, M. and Ferri, N.|year=2015|title=Laterality as an indicator of emotional stress in ewes and lambs during a separation test|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0928-3|pmid=26433604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sub-set of laterality in animals is limb dominance. Preferential limb use for specific tasks has been shown in species including chimpanzees, mice, bats, wallabies, parrots, chickens and toads.&lt;ref name="Manns" /&gt;

Another form of laterality is hemispheric dominance for processing conspecific vocalizations, reported for chimpanzees, sea lions, dogs, zebra finches and Bengalese finches.&lt;ref name="Manns" /&gt;

=== In mammals ===
[[Domestic horse]]s (''Equus ferus caballus'') exhibit laterality in at least two areas of neural organization, i.e. sensory and motor. In [[thoroughbred]]s, the strength of motor laterality increases with age.  Horses under 4 years old have a preference to initially use the right nostril during olfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Motor and sensory laterality in thoroughbred horses|author1=McGreevy, P.  |author2=Rogers, L.|year= 2005|journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science|doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2004.11.012|issue = 4|volume = 92|pages = 337–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with olfaction, French horses have an eye laterality when looking at novel objects. There is a correlation between their score on an emotional index and eye preference; horses with higher emotionality are more likely to look with their left eye. The less emotive [[French saddlebred]]s glance at novel objects using the right eye, however, this tendency is absent in the [[Trotter (horse)|trotters]], although the emotive index is the same for both breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laterality of horses associated with emotionality in novel situations|author=Larose, C., Richard-Yris, M.-A., Hausberger, M. and Rogers, L.J.|year=2006|journal = Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|doi = 10.1080/13576500600624221|pmid = 16754236|issue = 4|pages = 355–367|volume = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racehorse]]s exhibit laterality in stride patterns as well. They use their preferred stride pattern at all times whether racing or not, unless they are forced to change it while turning, injured, or fatigued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laterality in stride pattern preference in racehorses|author1=Williams, D.E.  |author2=Norris, B.J|year=2007|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.01.014|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|pages = 941–950|volume = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[domestic dogs]] (''Canis familiaris''), there is a correlation between motor laterality and noise sensitivity  - a lack of paw preference is associated with noise-related fearfulness. (Branson and Rogers, 2006){{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Fearfulness is an undesirable trait in guide dogs, therefore, testing for laterality can be a useful predictor of a successful guide dog. Knowing a guide dog's laterality can also be useful for training because the dog may be better at walking to the left or the right of their blind owner.&lt;ref name="Tomkins"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Tomkins, L.M., Thomson, P.C. and McGreevy, P.D.|year=2010|title = First-stepping Test as a measure of motor laterality in dogs (Canis familiaris) | url = | journal = Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research | volume = 5 | issue = 5| pages = 247–255 | doi = 10.1016/j.jveb.2010.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic cat]]s (''Felis silvestris catus'') show an individual handedness when reaching for static food.  In one study, 46% preferred to use the right paw, 44% the left, and 10% were ambi-lateral; 60% used one paw 100% of the time.  There was no difference between male and female cats in the proportions of left and right paw preferences. In moving-target reaching tests, cats have a left-sided behavioural asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=39|issue=3|year=1997|pages=241–247|title=Paw preferences in cats (Felis silvestris catus) living in a household environment|doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(96)00758-9|author1=Pike, A.V.L.  |author2=Maitland, D.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study indicates that laterality in this species is strongly related to temperament. Furthermore, individuals with stronger paw preferences are rated as more confident, affectionate, active, and friendly.&lt;ref name="McDowell2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=McDowell, L.J., Wells, D.L., Hepper, P.G. and Dempster, M.|year=2016|title=Lateral bias and temperament in the domestic cat (Felis Silvestris)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chimpanzee]]s show right-handedness in certain conditions.  This is expressed at the population level for females, but not males.  The complexity of the task has a dominant effect on handedness in chimps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Llorente, M., Riba, D., Palou, L., Carrasco, L., Mosquera, M., Colell, M. and Feliu, O.|year=2011|title=Population‐level right‐handedness for a coordinated bimanual task in naturalistic housed chimpanzees: replication and extension in 114 animals from Zambia and Spain|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=73|issue=3|pages=281–290|doi=10.1002/ajp.20895|pmid=20954250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cattle]] use [[Lateralization of brain function|visual/brain lateralisation]] in their visual scanning of novel and familiar stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Phillips, C.J.C., Oevermans, H., Syrett, K.L., Jespersen, A.Y. and Pearce, G.P. |year=2015 |title=Lateralization of behavior in dairy cows in response to conspecifics and novel persons |journal=Journal of Dairy Science |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=2389–2400 |doi=10.3168/jds.2014-8648|pmid=25648820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Domestic cattle prefer to view novel stimuli with the left eye, (similar to horses, Australian magpies, chicks, toads and fish) but use the right eye for viewing familiar stimuli.&lt;ref name="Robins"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Robins, A.  |author2=Phillips, C. |year=2010 |title=Lateralised visual processing in domestic cattle herds responding to novel and familiar stimuli |journal=Laterality |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=514–534 |doi=10.1080/13576500903049324|pmid=19629847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schreibers' long-fingered bat]] is lateralized at the population level and shows a left-hand bias for climbing or grasping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zucca |first1=P. |last2=Palladini |first2=A. |last3=Baciadonna |first3=L. |last4=Scaravelli |first4=D. |year=2010 |title=Handedness in the echolocating Schreiber's long-fingered bat (''Miniopterus schreibersii'') |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=693–695 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2010.04.006|pmid=20399840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of [[mastodon]] indicate laterality through the fossil remains having differing tusk lengths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====In marsupials====
[[Marsupials]] are fundamentally different from other mammals in that they lack a [[corpus callosum]].&lt;ref name="Nowak1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nowak |first=Ronald M. |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |date=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-5789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, wild [[kangaroo]]s and other [[Macropodidae|macropod]] [[marsupial]]s have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks.  Left-handedness is particularly apparent in the [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') and the [[eastern gray kangaroo]] (''Macropus giganteus'').  The [[red-necked wallaby]] (''Macropus rufogriseus'') preferentially uses the left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength.  There is less evidence for handedness in [[arboreal]] species.&lt;ref name="Sci-News"&gt;{{cite web |title=All kangaroos are lefties, scientists say |publisher=Sci-News.com |url=http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-kangaroos-lefties-02929.html |date=June 18, 2015 |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[Parrot]]s tend to favor one foot when grasping objects (for example fruit when feeding). Some studies indicate that most parrots are left footed.&lt;ref&gt;Zeigler, H. Phillip &amp; Hans-Joachim Bischof, eds. ''Vision, Brain, and Behavior in Birds.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian magpie]] (''Gymnorhina tibicen'') uses both left-eye and right-eye laterality when performing anti-predator responses, which include [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]].  Prior to withdrawing from a potential predator, Australian magpies view the animal with the left eye (85%), but prior to approaching, the right eye is used (72%). The left eye is used prior to jumping (73%) and prior to circling (65%) the predator, as well as during circling (58%) and for high alert inspection of the predator (72%). The researchers commented that "mobbing and perhaps circling are agonistic responses controlled by the LE[left eye]/right hemisphere, as also seen in other species. Alert inspection involves detailed examination of the predator and likely high levels of fear, known to be right hemisphere function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koboroff, A., Kaplan, G. and Rogers, L.J.|year=2008|title=Hemispheric specialization in Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) shown as eye preferences during response to a predator|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=76|issue=3|pages=304–306|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2008.02.015|pmid=18498946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yellow-legged gull]] (''Larus michahellis'') chicks show laterality when reverting from a supine to prone posture, and also in pecking at a dummy parental bill to beg for food. Lateralization occurs at both the population and individual level in the reverting response and at the individual level in begging. Females have a leftward preference in the righting response, indicating this is sex dependent. Laterality in the begging response in chicks varies according to laying order and matches variation in egg [[androgen]]s concentration.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Romano, M., Parolini, M., Caprioli, M., Spiezio, C., Rubolini, D. and Saino, N.|year=2015|title=Individual and population-level sex-dependent lateralization in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=115|pages=109–116|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2015.03.012|pmid=25818662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fish===
Laterality determines the organisation of rainbowfish (''Melanotaenia'' spp.) schools.  These fish demonstrate an individual eye preference when examining their reflection in a mirror.  Fish which show a right-eye preference in the mirror test prefer to be on the left side of the school. Conversely, fish that show a left-eye preference in the mirror test or were non-lateralised, prefer to be slightly to the right side of the school. The behaviour depends on the species and sex of the school.&lt;ref name="Bibost"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bibost, A-L.  |author2=Brown, C.|year=2013|title=Laterality enhances schooling position in rainbowfish, Melaotaenia spp|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e80907|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0080907|pmid=24260506|pmc=3829960|bibcode=2013PLoSO...880907B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In amphibians===
Three species of toads, the [[common toad]] (''Bufo bufo''), [[Bufo viridis|green toad]] (''Bufo viridis'') and the [[cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus'') show stronger escape and defensive responses when a model predator was placed on the toad's left side compared to their right side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lippolis, G., Bisazza, A., Rogers, L. J. and Vallortigara, G.|year=2002|title=Lateralisation of predator avoidance responses in three species of toads|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|volume=7|issue=2|pages=163–183|doi=10.1080/13576500143000221|pmid=15513195|citeseerx=10.1.1.511.7850}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emei music frog]]s (''Babina daunchina'') have a right-ear preference for positive or neutral signals such as a conspecific's advertisement call and white noise, but a left-ear preference for negative signals such as predatory attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Xue, F., Fang, G., Yang, P., Zhao, E., Brauth, S. E. and Tang, Y.|year=2015|title=The biological significance of acoustic stimuli determines ear preference in the music frog|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=218|issue=5|pages=740–747|doi=10.1242/jeb.114694|pmid=25740903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In invertebrates===
The [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] (''Ceratitis capitata'') exhibits left-biased population-level lateralisation of aggressive displays (boxing with forelegs and wing strikes) with no sex-differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Benelli, G., Donati, E., Romano, D., Stefanini, C., Messing, R. H. and Canale, A.|year=2015|title= Lateralisation of aggressive displays in a tephritid fly|journal=The Science of Nature|volume=102|issue=1–2|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/s00114-014-1251-6|pmid=25599665|bibcode=2015SciNa.102....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ants, ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' (rock ant) scouts show behavioural lateralization when exploring unknown nest sites, showing a population-level bias to prefer left turns. One possible reason for this is that its environment is partly maze-like and consistently turning in one direction is a good way to search and exit mazes without getting lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hunt ER, etal | year=2014 |title=Ants show a leftward turning bias when exploring unknown nest sites|journal=[[Biology Letters]] |volume=10 |issue=12 |pmid=25540159 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2014.0945 |pmc=4298197 |page=20140945}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turning bias is correlated with slight asymmetries in the ants' compound eyes (differential ommatidia count).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hunt ER, etal | year=2018 |title=Asymmetric ommatidia count and behavioural lateralization in the ant ''Temnothorax albipennis''|journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |volume=8 |issue=5825 | pages=5825 |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-23652-4| pmid=29643429 | pmc=5895843 | bibcode=2018NatSR...8.5825H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film ==
On television as a young child, he started appearing uncredited at the age of 8 in films such as ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952) and ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt; He quickly moved to featured status by the end of that year.

He showed talent as the kidnapped Indian "Red Chief" in a segment of the film ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]'' (1952) and another kidnap victim as the son of scientist [[Gene Barry]] in ''[[The Atomic City]]'' (1952).

In 1953, he co-starred in the [[John Wayne]] [[Western (genre)|western]] classic ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' (1953) as the [[curious]] [[blond]] son of homesteader [[Geraldine Page]].&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

He also appeared in other film styles such as the ''[[film noir]]'' thriller ''[[Jeopardy (film)|Jeopardy]]'' (1953) with [[Barbara Stanwyck]], the horse opera drama ''Arena'' (1953) with [[Gig Young]], and the comedies ''[[Mister Scoutmaster]]'' (1953) with [[Clifton Webb]] and ''[[Ricochet Romance]]'' (1954) with [[Marjorie Main]].

== Television ==
In 1953-54, Aaker was among the many child actors who auditioned for the role of "Jeff Miller" on the original 1954 ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' series, which later aired as ''Jeff's Collie''. That role went to [[Tommy Rettig]]. Two weeks later, Aaker won the role of "Rusty" on ''The Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin'', co-starring [[James Brown (Rin Tin Tin)|James Brown]] (1920–1992) as [[Lieutenant]] Ripley "Rip" Masters.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt; Aaker and Rettig were friends, and both shows were popular with audiences. The two actors and the two star dogs appeared together in a photograph used on the cover of the July 2, 1955 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''.{{r|rtt|page1=236}}

== Later years ==
Aaker told a newspaper reporter that when he reached the age of 21, he was paid a $10,000 lump sum by the studio that produced ''Rin Tin Tin'' "and he spent the rest of the '60s traveling around the world 'as sort of a flower child.'"&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rin Tin Tin's friend is now a carpenter|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/85252305/?terms=%22Lee%2BAaker%22|work=Southern Illinoisan|date=November 15, 1976|location=Illinois, Carbondale|page=18|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 30, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find work as an adult actor, Aaker got involved as a producer and later worked as a carpenter.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In the late 1960s, Aaker was married to Sharon Ann Hamilton for two years.&lt;ref name=xcs/&gt; He has resided in [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]], [[California]], for many years and is a special-needs ski instructor.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2005, Aaker won the [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Golden Boot Awards|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/goldboot.htm|website=The Old Corral|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as  ''Kids of the West''.

'''Living systems''' are open self-organizing life forms that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]] and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Woodruff | first = T.

Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory, arising out of the [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[Biology|biological sciences]], attempts to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their [[structure]], [[interaction]], [[behavior]] and [[developmental biology|development]]. This work is created by [[James Grier Miller]], which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Living Systems'', a "living system" must contain each of twenty "critical subsystems", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In ''Living Systems'' Miller provides a detailed look at a number of systems in order of increasing size, and identifies his subsystems in each. 
Miller considers living systems as a subset of all [[system]]s. Below the level of living systems, he defines [[space]] and [[time]], [[matter]] and [[energy]], [[information]] and [[entropy]], levels of [[organization]], and physical and conceptual factors, and above living systems ecological, planetary and solar systems, galaxies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen, 1998, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Living systems according to Parent (1996) are by definition "open self-organizing [[system]]s that have the special characteristics of life and interact with their [[social environment|environment]]. This takes place by means of information and material-energy exchanges. Living systems can be as simple as a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] or as complex as a supranational [[organization]] such as the European Union. Regardless of their [[complexity]], they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Parent, [http://projects.isss.org/the_living_systems_theory_of_james_grier_miller ''The Living Systems Theory of James Grier Miller''], Primer project ISSS, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller said that systems exist at eight "nested" hierarchical levels: cell, organ, organism, group, organization, community, society, and supranational system. At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary.

The processors of matter–energy are: 
* ingestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter

The processors of information are:
* input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer.

==Miller's living systems theory==
James Grier Miller in 1978 wrote a 1,102-page volume to present his living systems theory. He constructed a general theory of living [[system]]s by focusing on concrete systems—nonrandom accumulations of matter–energy in physical space–time organized into interacting, interrelated [[subsystem]]s or components. Slightly revising the original model a dozen years later, he distinguished eight "nested" hierarchical levels in such complex structures. Each level is "nested" in the sense that each higher level contains the next lower level in a nested fashion.

His central thesis is that the systems in existence at all eight levels are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] composed of twenty critical subsystems that process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of various forms of matter–energy and information. Two of these subsystems—reproducer and boundary—process both matter–energy and information. Eight of them process only matter–energy. The other ten process information only. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All nature is a continuum. The endless complexity of life is organized into patterns which repeat themselves—theme and variations—at each level of system. These similarities and differences are proper concerns for science. From the ceaseless streaming of protoplasm to the many-vectored activities of supranational systems, there are continuous flows through living systems as they maintain their highly organized steady states.&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Seppänen (1998) says that Miller applied [[general systems theory]] on a broad scale to describe all aspects of living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen 1998, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics in living systems theory===
Miller's theory posits that the mutual interrelationship of the components of a system extends across the hierarchical levels. Examples: Cells and organs of a living system thrive on the food the organism obtains from its suprasystem; the member countries of a supranational system reap the benefits accrued from the communal activities to which each one contributes. Miller says that his eclectic theory "ties together past discoveries from many disciplines and provides an outline into which new findings can be fitted".&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and energy organized by information. Miller's theory of living systems employs two sorts of spaces: physical or geographical space, and conceptual or abstracted spaces. Time is the fundamental "fourth dimension" of the physical space–time continuum/spiral. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies physical space. Mass and energy are equivalent as one can be converted into the other. Information refers to the degrees of freedom that exist in a given situation to choose among signals, symbols, messages, or patterns to be transmitted.

Other relevant concepts are system, structure, process, type, level, echelon, suprasystem, subsystem, transmissions, and steady state. A system can be conceptual, concrete or abstracted. The structure of a system is the arrangement of the subsystems and their components in three-dimensional space at any point of time. Process, which can be reversible or irreversible, refers to change over time of matter–energy or information in a system. Type defines living systems with similar characteristics. Level is the position in a hierarchy of systems. Many complex living systems, at various levels, are organized into two or more echelons. The suprasystem of any living system is the next higher system in which it is a subsystem or component. The totality of all the structures in a system which carry out a particular process is a subsystem. Transmissions are inputs and outputs in concrete systems. Because living systems are open systems, with continually altering fluxes of matter–energy and information, many of their equilibria are dynamic—situations identified as steady states or flux equilibria.

Miller identifies the comparable matter–energy and information processing critical subsystems. Elaborating on the eight hierarchical levels, he defines society, which constitutes the seventh hierarchy, as "a large, living, concrete system with [community] and lower am levels of living systems as subsystems and components".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; Society may include small, primitive, totipotential communities; ancient city–states, and kingdoms; as well as modern nation–states and empires that are not supranational systems. Miller provides general descriptions of each of the subsystems that fit all eight levels.

A supranational system, in Miller's view, "is composed of two or more societies, some or all of whose processes are under the control of a decider that is superordinate to their highest echelons".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 903&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contends that no supranational system with all its twenty subsystems under control of its decider exists today. The absence of a supranational decider precludes the existence of a concrete supranational system. Miller says that studying a supranational system is problematical because its subsystems
&lt;blockquote&gt;...tend to consist of few components besides the decoder. These systems do little matter-energy processing. The power of component societies [nations] today is almost always greater than the power of supranational deciders. Traditionally, theory at this level has been based upon intuition and study of history rather than data collection. Some quantitative research is now being done, and construction of global-system models and simulations is currently burgeoning.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1978, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the supranational system level, Miller's emphasis is on international organizations, associations, and groups comprising representatives of societies (nation–states). Miller identifies the subsystems at this level to suit this emphasis. Thus, for example, the reproducer is "any multipurpose supranational system which creates a single purpose supranational organization" (p.&amp;nbsp;914); and the boundary is the "supranational forces, usually located on or near supranational borders, which defend, guard, or police them" (p.&amp;nbsp;914).

===Strengths of Miller's theory===
Not just those specialized in international communication, but all communication science scholars could pay particular attention to the major contributions of living systems theory (LST) to social systems approaches that [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]], (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out:
* The specification of the twenty critical subsystems in any living system.
* The specification of the eight hierarchical levels of living systems.
* The emphasis on cross-level analysis and the production of numerous cross-level hypotheses.
* Cross-subsystem research (e.g., formulation and testing of hypotheses in two or more subsystems at a time).
* Cross-level, cross-subsystem research.

[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] says that LST, perhaps the "most integrative" social systems theory, has made many more contributions that may be easily overlooked, such as: providing a detailed analysis of types of systems; making a distinction between concrete and abstracted systems; discussion of physical space and time; placing emphasis on information processing; providing an analysis of entropy;  recognition of totipotential systems, and partipotential systems; providing an innovative approach to the structure–process issue; and introducing the concept of joint subsystem—a subsystem that belongs to two systems simultaneously; of dispersal—lateral, outward, upward, and downward; of inclusion—inclusion of something from the environment that is not part of the system; of artifact—an animal-made or human-made inclusion; of adjustment process, which combats stress in a system; and of critical subsystems, which carry out processes that all living systems need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. Bailey 2006, pp.292–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

LST's analysis of the twenty interacting subsystems, [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] adds, clearly distinguishing between matter–energy-processing and information-processing, as well as LST's analysis of the eight interrelated system levels, enables us to understand how social systems are linked to biological systems. LST also analyzes the irregularities or "organizational pathologies" of systems functioning (e.g., system stress and strain, feedback irregularities, information–input overload). It explicates the role of entropy in social research while it equates [[negentropy]] with information and order. It emphasizes both structure and process, as well as their interrelations.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. bailey, 1994, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
It omits the analysis of subjective phenomena, and it overemphasizes concrete Q-analysis (correlation of objects) to the virtual exclusion of R-analysis (correlation of variables). By asserting that societies (ranging from [[Totipotent#Totipotency|totipotential]] communities to nation-states and non-supranational systems) have greater control over their subsystem components than supranational systems have, it dodges the issue of transnational power over the contemporary social systems. Miller's supranational system bears no resemblance to the modern world-system that [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) described, although both of them were looking at the same living (dissipative) structure.

'''Longevity escape velocity''' (sometimes referred to as '''Actuarial escape velocity'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/03/actuarial-escap.html singularity2050.com/2008/03/actuarial-escap.html]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term used in the [[Anti-aging movement|life extension movement]].  It is a hypothetical situation in which [[life expectancy]] is being extended longer than the time that is passing.  For example, in a given year in which longevity escape velocity would be maintained, technological advances would increase life expectancy more than the year that just went by.

Life expectancy increases slightly every year as treatment strategies and technologies improve. At present, more than one year of research is required for each additional year of expected life. Longevity escape velocity occurs when this ratio reverses, so that life expectancy increases faster than one year per one year of research, as long as that rate of advance is sustainable.&lt;ref name=mattersnow&gt;{{Citation

A '''nanobe''' is a tiny filamental [[structure]] first found in some [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[sediment]]s.  Some scientists [[Hypothesis|hypothesize]] that nanobes are the smallest form of [[life]], 1/10 the size of the [[Mycoplasma|smallest known]] [[Bacterium|bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Nanjundiah2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nanjundiah | first =  V. | year = 2000 | title = The smallest form of life yet? | journal = Journal of Biosciences | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–10 | url = http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00001799/01/25smallest25(1)-9to10mar2000.pdf | doi = 10.1007/BF02985175 | pmid = 10824192 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No conclusive evidence exists that these structures are, or are not, living organisms, so their classification is controversial.

The 1996 discovery of nanobes was published in 1998&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Uwins, Philippa, J. R.|url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanobes.pdf|title=Novel nano-organisms from Australian sandstones|work= [[American Mineralogist]]| volume=83|pages=1541–1550|year=1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Philippa Uwins ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanophil.html Nanobes: About Philippa Uwins and the Discovery Team]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Queensland]], [[Australia]]. They were found growing from rock samples (both full-diameter and sidewall cores) of [[Jurassic]] and [[Triassic]] sandstones, originally retrieved from an unspecified number of [[oil exploration]] wells off Australia's west coast. Depths of retrieval were between {{convert|3400|m|mi|1}} and {{convert|5100|m|mi|1}} below the sea bed. While Uwins ''et al.'' present assertions against it, they do not exclude the possibility that the nanobes are from a surface contaminant, not from the rock units cited.

The smallest are just 20 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] in diameter. Some researchers believe that these structures are [[crystal]] growths, but the staining of these structures with dyes that bind to [[DNA]] might indicate that they are living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/nanobes/index.html "Nanobacteria and Nanobes- Are They Alive?"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to the structures found in [[ALH84001]], a [[Mars meteorite]] found in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. 
Nanobes are similar in size to [[nanobacteria]], which are also structures that have been proposed to be extremely small living organisms. However, these two should not be confused. Nanobacteria are thought to be cellular organisms, while nanobes are hypothesized to be a previously unknown form of life or [[protocell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The review also states that there is no evidence that nanobes are organisms in themselves and not fragments of larger organisms.

Tony Taylor was one of the authors of the original nanobe paper.&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998 /&gt; He argues that the conspicuous lack of phosphorus in the X-ray spectroscopy data and the failure to find DNA using various DNA amplification techniques demonstrates that nanobes do not have any DNA or RNA. He also argues that they may have a completely different mechanism for heredity, which would account for many of their unusual chemical and physical properties.

A '''near-death experience''' ('''NDE''') is a [[personal experience]] associated with death or impending [[death]]. When positive, such experiences may encompass a variety of sensations including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. When negative, such experiences may include sensations of torment and torture. &lt;ref name=Sleutjes2014rev&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25357254 | doi=10.1097/NMD.0000000000000205 | volume=202 | issue=11 | title=Almost 40 years investigating near-death experiences: an overview of mainstream scientific journals | year=2014 | journal=J.

Different models have been described to explain NDEs.&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; [[Neuroscience]] research suggests that an NDE is a [[wikt:subjective#Adjective|subjective]] phenomenon resulting from "disturbed bodily multisensory integration" that occurs during life-threatening events.&lt;ref name=blanke2009&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Neurology of Consciousness|last=Blanke|first=Olaf|publisher=London: Academic Publishers, 2009|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374168-4|location=London|pages=303–324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] is associated by some NDE researchers with aspects of the NDE.&lt;ref name="Lommel2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pim van Lommel |title=Consciousness Beyond Life: The science of the near-death experience |publisher=HarperOne |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-06-177725-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Evelyn Elsaesser Valarino |title=On the Other Side of Life: Exploring the phenomenon of the near-death experience |year=1997 |publisher=Perseus Publishing |isbn=978-0-7382-0625-7 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The equivalent [[french language|French]] term ''expérience de mort imminente'' (experience of imminent death) was proposed by the French [[psychologist]] and [[epistemology|epistemologist]] [[Victor Egger]] as a result of discussions in the 1890s among [[philosopher]]s and psychologists concerning [[Climbing|climbers']] stories of the panoramic life review during falls.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, Victor (1896). "Le moi des mourants", ''Revue Philosophique'', XLI : 26–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Neurological Disorders in Famous Artists, Part 3 |author=J. Bogousslavsky, M. G. Hennerici, H Bazner, C. Bassetti (Eds.) |publisher=Karger Publishers |year=2010 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTmyjVWIrTYC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189#v=onepage|isbn=9783805593304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1892 a series of subjective observations by workers falling from scaffolds, war soldiers who suffered injuries, climbers who had fallen from heights or other individuals who had come close to death (near drownings, accidents) was reported by [[Albert Heim]]. This was also the first time the phenomenon was described as clinical syndrome.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; In 1968 [[Celia Green]] published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of [[out-of-body experiences]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, C., ''Out-of-the-body Experiences'', London: Hamish Hamilton, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; This represented the first attempt to provide a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of such experiences, viewed simply as anomalous perceptual experiences, or [[hallucinations]]. In 1969, Swiss-American [[psychiatrist]] and pioneer in near-death studies [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|Elisabeth Kubler-Ross]] published her groundbreaking book ''[[On Death and Dying|On Death and Dying: What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families.]]'' These experiences were also popularized by the work of [[psychiatrist]] [[Raymond Moody]], who in 1975 coined the term "near-death experience" (NDE) as an umbrella term for the different elements (out of body experiences, the "panoramic life review," the Light, the tunnel, or the border). &lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; The term "near-death experience" had already been used by [[John C. Lilly]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Schlieter, Jens (2018). What is it like to be Dead? Near-death Experiences, Christianity, and the Occult. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 205-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Common elements===
[[Research]]ers have identified the common elements that define near-death experiences.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop&gt;Mauro, James. "Bright lights, big mystery", ''Psychology Today'', July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Greyson]] argues that the general features of the experience include impressions of being outside one's physical body, visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of egotic and spatiotemporal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Greyson, Bruce (2003) "Near-Death Experiences in a Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic Population". Psychiatric Services, December, Vol. 54 No. 12. The American Psychiatric Association&lt;/ref&gt; Many common elements have been reported, although the person's interpretation of these events often corresponds with the [[Culture|cultural]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], or [[religion|religious]] beliefs of the person experiencing it. For example, in the US, where 46% of the population believes in [[guardian angel]]s, they will often be identified as angels or deceased loved ones (or will be unidentified), while Hindus will often identify them as messengers of the god of death.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennard, Mary J 1998"&gt;Kennard, Mary J. "A Visit from an Angel." The American Journal of Nursing 98.3 (1998): 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Common traits that have been reported by NDErs are as follows:
* A sense/awareness of being dead.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* A sense of [[peace]], [[well-being]] and painlessness. Positive [[emotion]]s. A sense of removal from the world.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* An [[out-of-body experience]]. A perception of one's body from an outside position, sometimes observing medical professionals performing resuscitation efforts.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4003364 | volume=139 | issue=6 | title=Near-death experiences in a pediatric population.

* A "tunnel experience" or entering a darkness. A sense of moving up, or through, a passageway or staircase.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* A rapid movement toward and/or sudden immersion in a powerful light (or "Being of Light") which communicates with the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iands.org/ndes/nde-stories/iands-nde-accounts/1067-three-beings-of-light.html|title=Three Beings of Light|last=Lovins|first=LaDonna|website=iands.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An intense feeling of [[unconditional love]] and [[acceptance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/06/29/people-who-had-near-death-experiences-consistently-report-one-thing-gods-love/|title=Opinion {{!}} Stories of God's love common among those who almost die, says doctor who studies them|last=Long|first=Dr Jeffrey|date=2016-06-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encountering "Beings of Light", "Beings dressed in white", or similar. Also, the possibility of being reunited with deceased loved ones.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* Receiving a [[life review]], commonly referred to as "seeing one's life flash before one's eyes".&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;
* Approaching a border or a decision by oneself or others to return to one's body, often accompanied by a reluctance to return.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985"/&gt;
* Suddenly finding oneself back inside one's body.&lt;ref name= "Moody1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moody|first=Raymond|title=Life After Life|year=1975|isbn=978-0-89176-037-5|publisher=Mockingbird Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Connection to the cultural beliefs held by the individual, which seem to dictate some of the phenomena experienced in the NDE and particularly the later interpretation thereof.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Holden|editor1-first=Janice Miner|editor2-last=Greyson|editor2-first=Bruce|editor3-last=James|editor3-first=Debbie|title=The handbook of near-death experiences thirty years of investigation|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-35865-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Stages===
[[Kenneth Ring]] (1980) subdivided the NDE on a five-stage [[continuum (theory)|continuum]]. The subdivisions were:&lt;ref&gt;Ring, K. (1980). Life at death: A scientific investigation of the near-death experience. New York: Coward, McCann, &amp; Geoghegan., p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peace
# Body separation
# Entering darkness
# Seeing the light
# Entering the light

Charlotte Martial, a neuropsychologist from the [[University of Liège|University of Liège and University Hospital of Liège]] who led a team that investigated 154 NDE cases, concluded that there is not a fixed sequence of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/near-death-experiences-what-happens-when-you-die-643032|title=What happens when you die? Scientists attempt to find out how similar near-death experiences really are|date=2017-07-27|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical circumstances===
Kenneth Ring argues that attempted suicides do not lead more often to unpleasant NDEs than unintended near-death situations.&lt;ref&gt;Ring, Kenneth. ''Heading toward Omega. In search of the Meaning of Near-Death Experience'', 1984, p. 45. "Subsequent research on suicide-related NDEs by Stephen Franklin and myself [Ring] and by Bruce Greyson has also confirmed my earlier tentative findings the NDEs following suicide attempts, however induced, conform to the classic prototype."&lt;/ref&gt;

===After-effects===
NDEs are associated with changes in personality and outlook on life.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt; Ring has identified a consistent set of value and belief changes associated with people who have had a near-death experience. Among these changes, he found a greater appreciation for life, higher self-esteem, greater compassion for others, less concern for acquiring material wealth, a heightened sense of purpose and self-understanding, desire to learn, elevated spirituality, greater ecological sensitivity and planetary concern, and a feeling of being more intuitive.&lt;ref name=Mauro1992pop/&gt; However, not all after-effects are beneficial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7754094 | volume=18 | issue=3 | title=The meaning of survival: the early aftermath of a near-death experience | date=June 1995 | journal=Res Nurs Health | pages=239–47 | last1 = Orne | first1 = RM | doi=10.1002/nur.4770180307}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greyson describes circumstances where changes in attitudes and behavior can lead to psychosocial and psychospiritual problems.&lt;ref name=Greyson1997&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9171810 | volume=185 | issue=5 | title=The near-death experience as a focus of clinical attention | date=May 1997 | journal=J.

== Historical reports, incidence and prevalence ==

NDEs have been recorded since ancient times.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Handbook_of_Near_Death_Experiences.html?id=9MdUPgAACAAJ|title=The Handbook of Near-Death Experiences: Thirty Years of Investigation|date=Jun 22, 2009|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-35864-7|editor-last=Holden|editor-first=Janice Miner|pages=1–16|chapter=The Field of Near-Death Studies: Past, Present and Future|editor2-last=Greyson|editor2-first=Bruce|editor3-last=James|editor3-first=Debbie|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known medical report of near-death experiences was written by Pierre-Jean du Monchaux, an 18th century French military doctor who described such a case in his book "Anecdotes de Médecine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/46993-oldest-medical-report-of-near-death-experience.html|title=Oldest Medical Report of Near-Death Experience Discovered|date=July 24, 2014|first=Bahar|last=Gholipour|work=Live Science|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century a few studies moved beyond individual cases - one privately done by the Mormons and one in Switzerland. Up to 2005, 95% of world cultures are known to have made some mention of NDEs.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt;

A number of more contemporary sources report incidences of near death experiences of:

==Research==
===Near-death studies===
{{Main|Near-death studies}}
[[Bruce Greyson]] ([[psychiatrist]]), [[Kenneth Ring]] ([[psychologist]]), and [[Michael Sabom]] ([[cardiologist]]), helped to launch the field of [[near-death studies]] and introduced the study of near-death experiences to the academic setting. From 1975 to 2005, some 2,500 self-reported individuals in the US had been reviewed in retrospective studies of the phenomena&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; with an additional 600 outside the US in the West,&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; and 70 in Asia.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; Additionally, prospective studies had identified 270 individuals. Prospective studies review groups of individuals (e.g., selected emergency room patients) and then find who had an NDE during the study's time; such studies cost more to perform.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt; In all, close to 3,500 individual cases between 1975 and 2005 had been reviewed in one or another study. All these studies were carried out by some 55 researchers or teams of researchers.&lt;ref name="HandBook-Field" /&gt;

[[Melvin L. Morse|Melvin Morse]], head of the Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, and colleagues&lt;ref name="Morse M. 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morse M, Castillo P, Venecia D, Milstein J, Tyler DC. (1986) "Childhood near-death experiences". ''American Journal of Diseases of Children'', Nov;140(11):1110–4.&lt;/ref&gt; have investigated near-death experiences in a pediatric population.

=== Clinical research in cardiac arrest patients ===
==== Parnia 2001 study ====
In 2001, [[Sam Parnia]] and colleagues published the results of a year-long study of cardiac arrest survivors that was conducted at Southampton General Hospital. 63 survivors were interviewed. They had been resuscitated after being [[clinical death|clinically dead]] with no pulse, no respiration, and fixed dilated pupils. Parnia and colleagues investigated [[out-of-body experience]] claims by placing figures on suspended boards facing the ceiling, not visible from the floor.  Four had experiences that, according to the study criteria, were NDEs but none of them experienced the [[out-of-body experience]]. Thus, they were not able to identify the figures.&lt;ref name=Parnia2001primary&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=S.|last2=Waller|first2=D.

Psychologist [[Chris French]] wrote regarding the study "unfortunately, and somewhat atypically, none of the survivors in this sample experienced an OBE".&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;

==== Van Lommel's study ====
[[File:Pim van Lommel-1.jpg|250x250px|thumb|[[Pim van Lommel]]]]
In 2001 [[Pim van Lommel]], a cardiologist from the Netherlands, and his team conducted a study on NDEs including 344 cardiac arrest patients who had been successfully resuscitated in 10 Dutch hospitals. Patients not reporting NDEs were used as controls for patients who did, and psychological (e.g. fear before cardiac arrest), demographic (e.g. age, sex), medical (e.g. more than one [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR)) and pharmacological data were compared between the 2 groups. The work also included a longitudinal study where the 2 groups (those who had had an NDE and those who had not had one) were compared at 2 and 8 years, for life changes. One patient had a conventional out of body experience. He reported being able to watch and recall events during the time of his cardiac arrest. His claims were confirmed by hospital personnel. "This did not appear consistent with hallucinatory or illusory experiences, as the recollections were compatible with real and verifiable rather than imagined events".&lt;ref name=Parnia2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lommel2001primary&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Lommel|first1=P|last2=van Wees| first2=R|last3=Meyers|first3=V|last4=Elfferich|first4=I|title=Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands| journal=Lancet |date=15 December 2001 |volume=358 |issue=9298 |pages=2039–45|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)07100-8|pmid=11755611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Awareness during Resuscitation (AWARE) study ====
While at University of Southampton, Parnia was the principal investigator of the AWARE Study, which was launched in 2008.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sam Parnia#cite note-TIME magazine 2008-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This study which concluded in 2012 included 33 investigators across 15 medical centers in the UK, Austria and the US and tested consciousness, memories and awareness during cardiac arrest. The accuracy of claims of visual and auditory awareness was examined using specific tests.&lt;ref name=Parnia2015primary&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=Sam|last2=Spearpoint|first2=Ken|last3=de Vos|first3=Gabriele |last4=Fenwick |first4=Peter |last5=Goldberg |first5=Diana|last6=Yang|first6=Jie|last7=Zhu|first7=Jiawen|last8=Baker|first8=Katie|last9=Killingback|first9=Hayley|date=2014-12-01 |title=AWARE-AWAreness during REsuscitation-a prospective study |journal=Resuscitation|volume=85|issue=12|pages=1799–1805 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.09.004 |pmid=25301715}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such test consisted in installing shelves, bearing a variety of images and facing the ceiling, hence not visible by hospital staff, in rooms where cardiac-arrest patients were more likely to occur. The results of the study were published in October 2014; both the launch and the study results were widely discussed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/the-science-of-near-death-experiences/386231/ |title=The science of near-death experiences: Empirically investigating brushes with the afterlife|last=Lichfield|first=Gideon|date=April 2015|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201409/seeing-the-light|title=Seeing the light |last=Weintraub |first=Pamela |date=September 2014 |website=Psychology Today|publisher=Psychology Today|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review article analyzing the results reports that, out of 2060 cardiac arrest events, 101 of 140 cardiac arrest survivors could complete the questionnaires. Of these 101 patients 9% could be classified as near death experiences. 2 more patients (2% of those completing the questionnaires) described "seeing and hearing actual events related to the period of cardiac arrest". These two patients' cardiac arrests did not occur in areas equipped with ceiling shelves hence no images could be used to objectively test for visual awareness claims. One of the two patients was too sick and the accuracy of her recount could not be verified. For the second patient instead, it was possible to verify the accuracy of the experience and to show that awareness occurred paradoxically some minutes after the heart stopped, at a time when "the brain ordinarily stops functioning and cortical activity becomes isoelectric." The experience was not compatible with an illusion, imaginary event or hallucination since visual (other than of ceiling shelves' images) and auditory awareness could be corroborated.&lt;ref name=Parnia2014rev/&gt;

==== AWARE II ====
{{as of|2016|May}}, a posting at the UK Clinical Trials Gateway website described plans for [[Out-of-body experience#AWARE Study II|AWARE II]], a two-year multicenter observational study of 900-1500 patients experiencing cardiac arrest, which said that subject recruitment had started on 1 August 2014 and that the scheduled end date was 31 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;UK Clinical Trials Gateway. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160509201054/https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/trials/trial-details/trial-details?trialId=31651 Primary Trial ID Number 17129], entitled "AWARE II (AWAreness during REsuscitation) A Multi-Centre Observational Study of the Relationship between the Quality of Brain Resuscitation and Consciousness, Neurological, Functional and Cognitive Outcomes following Cardiac Arrest" Last updated May 3, 2016.

== Explanatory models ==
In a review article, psychologist [[Chris French]]&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt; has grouped approaches to explain NDEs in three broad groups which "are not distinct and independent, but instead show considerable overlap": spiritual theories (also called transcendental), psychological theories, and physiological theories that provide a physical explanation for NDEs.

=== Spiritual or transcendental theories ===
French summarizes this model by saying : "the most popular interpretation is that the NDE is exactly what it appears to be to the person having the experience".&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt; The NDE would then represent evidence of the supposedly immaterial existence of a soul or mind, which would leave the body upon death. An NDE would then provide information about an immaterial world where the soul would journey upon ending its physical existence on earth.&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt;

According to Greyson&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; some NDE phenomena cannot be easily explained with our current knowledge of human physiology and psychology. For instance, at a time when they were unconscious patients could accurately describe events as well as report being able to view their bodies "from an out-of-body spatial perspective". In two different studies of patients who had survived a cardiac arrest, those who had reported leaving their bodies could describe accurately their resuscitation procedures or unexpected events, whereas others "described incorrect equipment and procedures".&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; Sam Parnia also refers to two cardiac arrest studies and one deep hypothermic circulatory arrest study where patients reported visual and/or auditory awareness occurring when their brain function had ceased. These reports "were corroborated with actual and real events".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parnia|first=Sam|date=February 2017|title=Understanding the cognitive experience of death and the near-death experience|url=https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article-abstract/110/2/67/2681812?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=QJM: An International Journal of Medicine|volume=110(2)|pages=67–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt;

Five prospective studies have been carried out, to test the accuracy of out of body perceptions by placing "unusual targets in locations likely to be seen by persons having NDEs, such as in an upper corner of a room in the emergency department, the coronary care unit, or the intensive care unit of a hospital." Twelve patients reported leaving their bodies, but unfortunately none could describe the hidden visual targets. Although this is a small sample, the failure of purported out-of-body experiencers to describe the hidden targets raises questions about the accuracy of the anecdotal reports described above.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] has described the afterlife claims of NDE researchers as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. Alcock has written the spiritual or transcendental interpretation "is based on belief in search of data rather than observation in search of explanation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Kendrick|title=Paranormal Borderlands of Science|date=1981|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-87975-148-7|pages=153–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris French has noted that "the survivalist approach does not appear to generate clear and testable hypotheses. Because of the vagueness and imprecision of the survivalist account, it can be made to explain any possible set of findings and is therefore unfalsifiable and unscientific."&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris French|French, Chris]].

=== Psychological explanations ===
French summarises the main psychological explanations which include: the depersonalization, the expectancy and the dissociation models.&lt;ref name="French2005rev"/&gt;

==== Depersonalization model ====
A depersonalization model was proposed in the 1970s by professor of psychiatry Russell Noyes and clinical psychologist Roy Kletti, which suggested that the NDE is a form of [[depersonalization]] experienced under emotional conditions such as life-threatening danger, potentially inescapable danger, and that the NDE can best be understood as an hallucination.&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R |year = 1972 |title = The experience of dying |url = |journal = Psychiatry |volume = 35 |issue = 2|pages = 174–184 |doi=10.1080/00332747.1972.11023710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R. |last2 = Kletti |first2 = R. |year = 1976 |title = Depersonalisation in the face of life-threatening danger: an interpretation |url = |journal = Omega |volume = 7 |issue = 2|pages = 103–114 |doi=10.2190/7qet-2vau-ycdt-tj9r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Noyes |first1 = R. |last2 = Kletti |first2 = R. |year = 1977 |title = Depersonalisation in the face of life-threatening danger |url = |journal = Compr. Psychiat |volume = 18 |issue = |pages = 375–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noyes, R. and Slymen, D. (1978–1979) ''The subjective response to life-threatening danger''. ''Omega'' 9: 313–321.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, those who face their impending death become detached from the surroundings and their own bodies, no longer feel emotions, and experience time distortions.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

This model suffers from a number of limitations to explain NDEs for subjects who do not experience a sensation of being out of their bodies; unlike NDEs, experiences are dreamlike, unpleasant and characterized by "anxiety, panic and emptiness".&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt; Also, during NDEs subjects remain very lucid of their identities, their sense of identify is not changed unlike those experiencing depersonalization.&lt;ref name=Greyson2014/&gt;

==== Expectancy model ====
Another psychological theory is called the expectancy model. It has been suggested that although these experiences could appear very real, they had actually been constructed in the mind, either consciously or subconsciously, in response to the stress of an encounter with death (or perceived encounter with death), and did not correspond to a real event. In a way, they are similar to wish-fulfillment: because someone thought they were about to die, they experienced certain things in accordance with what they expected or wanted to occur. Imagining a heavenly place was in effect a way for them to soothe themselves through the stress of knowing that they were close to death.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt; Subjects use their own personal and cultural expectations to imagine a scenario that would protect them against an imminent threat to their lives.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Subjects' accounts often differed from their own "religious and personal expectations regarding death" which contradicts the hypothesis they may have imagined a scenario based on their cultural and personal background.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Although the term NDE was first coined in 1975 and the experience first described then, recent descriptions of NDEs do not differ from those reported earlier than 1975. The only exception is the more frequent description of a tunnel.  Hence, the fact that information about these experiences could be more easily obtained after 1975, did not influence people's reports of the experiences.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

Another flaw of this model can be found in children's accounts of NDEs. These are similar to adults', and this despite children being less affected by religious or cultural influences about death.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Dissociation model ====
The dissociation model proposes that NDE is a form of withdrawal to protect an individual from a stressful event. Under extreme circumstances some people may detach from certain unwanted feelings in order to avoid experiencing their emotional impact and suffering associated with them. The person also detaches from one's immediate surroundings.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

==== Birth model ====
The birth model suggests that near death experiences could be a form of reliving the trauma of birth. Since a baby travels from the darkness of the womb to light and is greeted by the love and warmth of the nursing and medical staff, and so, it was proposed, the dying brain could be recreating the passage through a tunnel to light, warmth and affection.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Reports of leaving the body through a tunnel are equally frequent among subjects who were born by cesarean section and natural birth. Also, newborns do not possess "the visual acuity, spatial stability of their visual images, mental alertness, and cortical coding capacity to register memories of the birth experience".&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

=== Physiological explanations (organic theories) ===
A wide range of physiological theories of the NDE have been put forward including those based upon [[cerebral hypoxia]], anoxia, and [[hypercapnia]]; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Neurobiological factors in the experience have been investigated by researchers in the field of medical science and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Mayank and Mukesh, 2004; Jansen, 1995; Thomas, 2004; Fenwick and Fenwick 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among the researchers and commentators who tend to emphasize a naturalistic and neurological base for the experience are the [[Great Britain|British]] [[psychologist]] [[Susan Blackmore]] (1993), with her "dying brain hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bassham |first1=Gregory|title=Critical Thinking: A Student's Untroduction|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-287959-9 |page=485 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Neuroanatomical models ====
Neuroscientists Olaf Blanke and Sebastian Dieguez (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Leaving Body And Life Behind:[http://lnco.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/lnco/files/shared/publications/lnco/2009_Dieguez_NC(chap)_leaving%20body%20and%20life%20behind-out%20of%20body%20and%20near%20death%20experience.pdf lnco.epfl.ch]&lt;/ref&gt; from the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]'', [[Switzerland]], propose a brain based model with two types of NDEs : 
* "type 1 NDEs are due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly right hemispheric brain damage affecting the right temporal parietal junction and characterized by out of body experiences, altered sense of time, sensations of flying, lightness vection and flying" &lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;
* "type 2 NDEs are also due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly left hemispheric brain damage affecting the left temporal parietal junction and characterized by feeling of a presence, meeting and communication with spirits, seeing of glowing bodies, as well as voices, sounds, and music without vection" &lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;
They suggest that damage to the bilateral [[Occipital lobe|occipital cortex]] may lead to visual features of NDEs such as seeing a tunnel or lights, and "damage to unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe structures such as the [[hippocampus]] and amygdala" may lead to emotional experiences, memory flashbacks or a life review. They concluded that future neuroscientific studies are likely to reveal the neuroanatomical basis of the NDE which will lead to the demystification of the subject without needing paranormal explanations.&lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt;

[[File:Temporal lobe animation.gif|thumb|160px|left|Animation of the human left temporal lobe]]

French has written that the "temporal lobe is almost certain to be involved in NDEs, given that both damage to and direct cortical stimulation of this area are known to produce a number of experiences corresponding to those of the NDE, including OBEs, hallucinations, and memory flashbacks".&lt;ref name=French2005rev /&gt;

Vanhaudenhuyse ''et al''. 2009 reported that recent studies employing [[deep brain stimulation]] and [[neuroimaging]] have demonstrated that out-of-body experiences result from a deficient [[multisensory integration]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]] and that ongoing studies aim to further identify the functional neuroanatomy of near-death experiences by means of standardized EEG recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intensive Care Medicine |date=2009|publisher=Springer New York | isbn=978-0-387-92277-5 |location=[S.l.] |pages=961–968 |last1=Vincent |first1=Jean-Louis|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-92276-6_85|chapter=Towards a Neuro-scientific Explanation of Near-death Experiences?|citeseerx=10.1.1.368.4580}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to Greyson&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; multiple neuroanatomical models have been proposed where NDEs have been hypothesized to originate from different anatomical areas of the brain, namely: the limbic system, the hippocampus, the left temporal lobe, Reissen's fiber in the central canal of the spinal cord, the prefrontal cortex, the right temporal lobe.

Blanke et al.&lt;ref name="blanke2009" /&gt; admit that their model remains speculative to the lack of data. Likewise Greyson&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; writes that although some or any of the neuroanatomical models proposed may serve to explain NDEs and pathways through which they are expressed, they remain speculative at this stage since they have not been tested in empirical studies.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Neurochemical models ====
Some theories hypothesize that drugs used during resuscitation induced NDEs, for example, [[ketamine]] or as resulting from endogeneous chemicals that transmit signals between brain cells, [[neurotransmitter]]s:&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt;
* In the early eighties, Daniel Carr wrote that NDE has characteristics are suggestive of a [[limbic lobe]] syndrome and that the NDE can be explained by the release of [[endorphins]] and [[enkephalin]]s in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = Daniel | year = 1981 | title = Endorphins at the Approach of Death | url = |journal = Lancet | volume = 317 | issue = 8216| page = 390 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(81)91714-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carr |first1 = Daniel | year = 1982 | title = Pathophysiology of Stress-Induced Limbic Lobe Dysfunction: A Hypothesis Relevant to Near-Death Experiences | url = | journal = Anabiosis: The Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 75–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endorphins are endogenous molecules "released in times of stress and lead to a reduction in pain perception and a pleasant, even blissful, emotional state." &lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; 
* Judson and Wiltshaw (1983) noted how the administration of endorphin-blocking agents such as [[naloxone]] had been occasionally reported to produce "hellish" NDEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wiltshaw|first2=E.|year=1983|title=A near-death experience|url=|journal=Lancet|issue=8349|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(83)90582-2 |pages=561–562|last1=Judson|first1=I. R|volume=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be coherent with endorphins' role in causing a "positive emotional tone of most NDEs".&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt; 
* Morse ''et al''. 1989 proposed a model arguing that [[serotonin]] played a more important role than endorphins in generating NDEs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morse | first1 = M. L | last2 = Venecia | first2 = D | last3 = Milstein | first3 = J. | year = 1989 | title = Near-death experiences: A neurophysiological explanatory model | url = | journal = Journal of Near-Death Studies | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 45–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "at least with respect to mystical hallucinations and OBEs".&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;

According to Parnia, neurochemical models are not backed by data. This is true for "NMDA receptor activation, serotonin, and endorphin release" models.&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt; Parnia writes that no data has been collected via thorough and careful experimentation to back "a possible causal relationship or even an association" between neurochemical agents and NDE experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Multi-factorial models ====
The first formal neurobiological model for NDE, included endorphins, neurotransmitters of the [[limbic system]], the temporal lobe and other parts of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gómez-Jeria|first2=Juan S.|year=1989|title=A Neurobiological Model for Near-Death Experiences|url=http://200.89.70.78:8080/jspui/handle/2250/14775|journal=Journal of Near-Death Studies|volume=7|issue=4|pages=205–222|doi=10.1007/bf01074007|last1=Saavedra-Aguilar|first1=J.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions and variations of their model came from other scientists such as Louis Appleby (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1989|title=Near·death experience: Analogous to other stress induced psychological phenomena|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=298|issue=|pages=976–977|last1=Appleby|first1=L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors suggest that all components of near-death experiences can be explained in their entirety via psychological or neurophysiological mechanisms, although the authors admit that these hypotheses have to be tested by science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mobbs|first=Dean|last2=Watt|first2=Caroline|date=October 2011|title=There is nothing paranormal about near-death experiences: how neuroscience can explain seeing bright lights, meeting the dead, or being convinced you are one of them|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=15|issue=10|pages=447–449|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2011.07.010|pmid=21852181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Low oxygen levels (and G-LOC) model  ====
Low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxia or anoxia) have been hypothesized to induce hallucinations and hence possibly explain NDEs.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name=French2005rev/&gt; This is because low oxygen levels characterize life-threatening situations and also by the apparent similarities between NDEs and G-force induced loss of consciousness ([[G-LOC]]) episodes.

These episodes are observed with fighter pilots experiencing very rapid and intense acceleration that result in lack of sufficient blood supply to the brain. Whinnery&lt;ref name="Whinnery"&gt;Whinnery, J. E. (1997). ''Psychophysiologic correlates of unconsciousness and near-death experiences''. J. Near Death Stud 15: 231–258.&lt;/ref&gt; studied almost 1000 cases and noted how the experiences often involved "tunnel vision and bright lights, floating sensations, automatic movement, autoscopy, OBEs, not wanting to be disturbed, paralysis, vivid dreamlets of beautiful places, pleasurable sensations, psychological alterations of euphoria and dissociation, inclusion of friends and family, inclusion of prior memories and thoughts, the experience being very memorable (when it can be remembered), confabulation, and a strong urge to understand the experience."&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whinnery" /&gt;

However, hypoxia-induced acceleration's primary characteristics are "rythmic jerking of the limbs, compromised memory of events just prior to the onset of unconsciousness, tingling of extremities ..." that are not observed during NDEs.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt; Also G-LOC episodes do not feature life reviews, mystical experiences and "long-lasting transformational aftereffects", although this may be due to the fact that subjects have no expectation of dying.&lt;ref name="French2005rev" /&gt;

Also, hypoxic hallucinations are characterized by "distress and agitation" and this is very different from near death experiences which subjects report as being pleasant.&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt;

==== Altered blood gas levels models ====
Some investigators have studied whether [[wikt:hypercarbia|hypercarbia]] or higher than normal carbon dioxide levels, could explain the occurrence of NDEs. However, studies are difficult to interpret since NDEs have been observed both with increased levels as well as decreased levels of carbon dioxide, and finally some other studies have observed NDEs when levels had not changed, and there is little data.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;

==== Other models ====
French said that at least some reports of NDEs might be based upon [[False memory syndrome|false memories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = French | first1 = Chris | authorlink = Chris French | year = 2001 | title = Dying to Know the Truth: Visions of a Dying Brain, or False Memories? | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9298| pages = 2010–2011 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)07133-1| pmid = 11755600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Engmann (2008) near-death experiences of people who are [[clinical death|clinically dead]] are psychopathological symptoms caused by a severe malfunction of the brain resulting from the cessation of cerebral blood circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Engmann, Birk. (2008). ''Near-death Experiences: A review on the thesis of pathoclisis, neurotransmitter abnormalities, and psychological aspects''. MMW-Fortschr.Med.Nr.51-52/2008(150.Jg.) pp.42–43. {{PMID|19156957}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important question is whether it is possible to "translate" the bloomy experiences of the reanimated survivors into psychopathologically basic phenomena, e.g., acoasms (nonverbal auditory hallucinations), central narrowing of the visual field, [[autoscopy|autoscopia]], [[visual hallucinations]], activation of limbic and memory structures according to Moody's stages. The symptoms suppose a primary affliction of the [[occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] cortices under clinical death. This basis could be congruent with the thesis of [[pathoclisis]]—the inclination of special parts of the brain to be the first to be damaged in case of disease, lack of oxygen, or malnutrition—established eighty years ago by [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier|Cécile]] and [[Oskar Vogt]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogt C, Vogt O. (1922). ''Erkrankungen der Großhirnrinde im Lichte der Topistik, Pathoklise und Pathoarchitektonik''. Journal für Psychologie und Neurologie; Bd. 28. Joh.- Ambr.- Barth- Verlag. Leipzig. (German).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of neurology [[Terence Hines]] (2003) claimed that near-death experiences are hallucinations caused by [[Cerebral hypoxia|cerebral anoxia]], drugs, or brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hines|first1=Terence|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-57392-979-0|pages=101–104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural aspects==
Gregory Shushan published an analysis of the afterlife beliefs of five ancient civilisations (Old and Middle Kingdom Egypt, Sumerian and Old Babylonian Mesopotamia, Vedic India, pre-Buddhist China, and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica) and compared them with historical and contemporary reports of near-death experiences, and [[shamanism|shaman]]ic afterlife "journeys". Shushan found similarities across time, place, and culture that he found could not be explained by coincidence; he also found elements that were specific to cultures; Shushan concludes that some form of mutual influence between experiences of an afterlife and culture probably influence one another and that this inheritance in turn influences individual NDEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shushan|first1=Gregory|title=Conceptions of the Afterlife in Early Civilizations: Universalism, Constructivism, and Near-Death Experience|date=2009|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-4073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, it has been argued that near-death experiences and many of their elements (vision of God, judgment, the tunnel, or the life review) are closely related to religious and spiritual traditions of the West. It was mainly Christian visionaries, Spiritualists, Occultists, and Theosophists of the 19th and 20th century that reported them (Schlieter 2018).

According to Parnia, near death experiences' interpretations are influenced by religious, social, cultural backgrounds. However, the core elements appear to transcend borders and can be considered universal. In fact, some of these core elements have even been reported by children &lt;3 years old (this occurred over many months, whilst playing and communicated using children's language). In other words, at an age where they should not have been influenced by culture or tradition.&lt;ref name="Parnia2014rev" /&gt;

Also, according to Greyson,&lt;ref name="Greyson2014" /&gt; the central features of NDEs are universal and have not been influenced by time. These have been observed throughout history and in different cultures. This notwithstanding, cultural influences have probably played a role in some NDEs' reported descriptions.

[[File:Frog in frogspawn.jpg|right|thumb|A [[frog]] in [[frog#Eggs / frogspawn|frogspawn]]]]
In [[biology]], '''offspring''' are the young born of living [[organism]]s, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of [[sexual reproduction]], two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a '''brood''' or '''progeny''' in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the [[bird|chicks]] hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the [[brood (honeybee)|honeybee]].

Human offspring ([[kinship and descent|descendants]]) are referred to as [[child]]ren (without reference to age, thus one can refer to a parent's "[[minor (law)|minor]] children" or "[[adult]] children" or "[[infant|infant children]]" or "[[Teenagers|teenage children]]" depending on their age); male children are [[son]]s and female children are [[daughter]]s (see [[kinship and descent]]). Offspring can occur after mating or after [[artificial insemination]].

Offspring contains many parts and properties that are precise and accurate in what they consist of, and what they define. As the offspring of a new species, also known as a child or f1 generation, consist of genes of the father and the mother, which is also known as the parent generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these offspring contains numerous genes which have coding for specific tasks and properties. Males and females both contribute equally to the genotypes of their offspring, in which gametes fuse and form. An important aspect of the formation of the parent offspring is the chromosome, which is a structure of DNA which contains many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To focus more on the offspring and how it results in the formation of the f1 generation, is an inheritance called sex-linkage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a gene which is located on the sex chromosome and patterns of these inheritance differ in both male and female. The explanation that proves the theory of the offspring having genes from both parent generations, is proven through a process called crossing-over, which consists of taking genes from the male chromosomes and genes from the female chromosome, resulting in a process of [[meiosis]] occurring, and leading to the splitting of the chromosomes evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on which genes are dominantly expressed in the gene will result in the sex of the offspring. The female will always give an X chromosome, whereas the male, depending on the situation, will either give an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. If a male offspring is produced, the gene will consist of an X and a Y chromosome. If two X chromosomes are expressed and produced, it produces a female offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is the production of an offspring which represents the identical genes as its parent. Reproductive cloning begins with the removal of the nucleus from an egg, which holds the genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to clone an organ, a stem cell is to be produced and then utilized to clone that specific organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception of cloning is that it produces an exact copy of the parent being cloned. Cloning copies the DNA/genes of the parent and then creates a genetic duplicate. The clone will not be a similar copy as he or she will grow up in different surroundings from the parent and may encounter different opportunities and experiences. Although mostly positive, cloning also faces some setbacks in terms of ethics and human health. Though cell division and DNA replication is a vital part of survival, there are many steps involved and mutations can occur with permanent change in an organism's and their offspring's DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnemstudio.org/genetic-algorithms-mutation.htm|title=mutation|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutations can be good as they result in random evolution periods in which may be good for the species, but most mutations are bad as they can change the genotypes of offspring, which can result in changes that harm the species.

In [[biology]], an '''organism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ὀργανισμός, ''organismos'') is any individual [[entity]] that exhibits the [[Life#Biology|properties of life]]. It is a synonym for "[[Outline of life forms|life form]]".

Organisms are classified by [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] into specified groups such as the [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[fungi]]; or [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] [[microorganism]]s such as a [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]], and [[archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=RS.|title=A dictionary of biology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920462-5|page=461|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All types of organisms are capable of [[reproduction]], [[Developmental biology|growth and development]], [[homeostasis|maintenance]], and some degree of response to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. [[Human]]s are multicellular animals composed of many trillions of cells which [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] during [[developmental biology|development]] into specialized [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]].

An organism may be either a [[prokaryote]] or a [[eukaryote]]. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate [[Three-domain system|domains]]—[[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound [[cell nucleus]] and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called [[organelle]]s (such as [[mitochondria]] in animals and plants and [[plastid]]s in plants and [[algae]], all generally considered to be derived from [[symbiogenesis|endosymbiotic]] bacteria).&lt;ref name=cavaliersmith1987&gt;{{cite journal| author = Cavalier-Smith T.| year = 1987| title = The origin of eukaryotic and archaebacterial cells| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| volume = 503| issue =| pages = 17–54| pmid = 3113314| doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb40596.x| bibcode = 1987NYASA.503...17C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi, animals and plants are examples of [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of organisms within the eukaryotes.

==Etymology==
The term "organism" (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀργανισμός, ''organismos'', from ὄργανον, ''organon'', i.e. "instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension"&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|o)/rganon|ὄργανον|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=organism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=organism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) first appeared in the English language in 1703 and took on its current definition by 1834 ([[Oxford English Dictionary]]). It is directly related to the term "organization". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings, going back at least to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1790 ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I., [[Critique of Judgment]]: §64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
An organism may be defined as an assembly of [[molecule]]s functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the [[Life#Biology|properties of life]]. Dictionary definitions can be broad, using phrases such as "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction".&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary |edition=online |date=1999 |title=organism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many definitions exclude [[virus]]es and possible man-made [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|non-organic life]] forms, as viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{Cite OED|organism|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[superorganism]] is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or [[social unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=98 |isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-cellular life===
{{main|Non-cellular life}}
[[Virus]]es are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous [[reproduction]], growth or [[metabolism]]. This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but are capable of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few [[enzyme]]s and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own; they cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds from which they are formed. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction: they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the [[cell (biology)|host cell]]. In this sense, they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not classified as organisms, they do have their own [[gene]]s, and they do [[evolution|evolve]] by mechanisms similar to the evolutionary mechanisms of organisms.

The most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of cellular evolution could be different, but cells would nevertheless be able to evolve. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate.&lt;ref name="10reasons" &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moreira | first1 = D. | last2 = López-García | first2 = P. N. | title = Ten reasons to exclude viruses from the tree of life | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2108 | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | year = 2009 | pmid = 19270719| pmc = | volume=7 | issue = 4 | pages=306–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of viral megagenomes with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong in the [[tree of life]]. The presence of these genes suggested that viruses were once able to metabolize. However, it was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have a cellular origin. Most likely, these genes were acquired through [[horizontal gene transfer]] from viral hosts.&lt;ref name="10reasons" /&gt;

==Chemistry==
Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern [[Biochemistry|the chemical processes of life]]. It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their [[DNA]]-based genes.

Organisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of [[chemical compound]]s that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles.

Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. [[Autotroph]]s produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while [[heterotroph]]s take in organic compounds from the environment.

The primary [[chemical element]] in these compounds is [[carbon]]. The [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as [[carbon dioxide]]), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data ([[nucleic acid]]s), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein).

===Macromolecules===
Compounds that make up organisms may be divided into [[macromolecule]]s and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are [[nucleic acid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s. Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of [[nucleotide]]s. The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides ([[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]]) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into [[codon]]s, each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular [[amino acid]]. Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, [[protein folding|folds]] in a particular manner and so performs a particular function.

These protein functions have been recognized:
# [[Enzyme]]s, which catalyze all of the reactions of metabolism
# Structural proteins, such as [[tubulin]], or [[collagen]]
# Regulatory proteins, such as [[transcription factor]]s or cyclins that regulate the cell cycle
# Signaling molecules or their receptors such as some [[hormone]]s and their receptors
# Defensive proteins, which can include everything from [[Antibody|antibodies]] of the [[immune system]], to toxins (e.g., [[dendrotoxin]]s of snakes), to proteins that include unusual amino acids like [[canavanine]]

A bilayer of [[phospholipid]]s makes up the [[phospholipid membrane|membrane]] of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell. Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membrane only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins. In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms.

==Structure==
All organisms consist of structural units called [[cell (biology)|cells]]; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely [[epithelium]], [[nervous tissue]], [[muscle tissue]], and [[connective tissue]]. Several types of tissue work together in the form of an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the [[heart]], or as a barrier to the environment as the [[skin]]). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an [[organ system]] such as the [[reproductive system]], and [[digestive system]]. Many multicellular organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life.

===Cell===
The [[cell theory]], first developed in 1839 by [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]], states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; and cells contain the [[genetics|hereditary information]] necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells.

There are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a [[nuclear membrane]] so [[DNA]] is unbound within the cell; eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes.

All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a [[cell membrane|membrane]], which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the [[Membrane potential|electric potential of the cell]]. Inside the membrane, a [[salt]]y [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells.

All cells share several similar characteristics of:&lt;ref name="AlbertsCh1"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=%22all+cells%22+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+372023%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4.section.4#23 The Universal Features of Cells on Earth] in Chapter 1 of ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&amp;db=books&amp;doptcmdl=GenBookHL&amp;term=cell+biology+AND+mboc4%5Bbook%5D+AND+373693%5Buid%5D&amp;rid=mboc4 Molecular Biology of the Cell]'' fourth edition, edited by Bruce Alberts (2002) published by Garland Science.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reproduction by [[cell division]] ([[binary fission]], [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]]).
* Use of enzymes and other proteins [[genetic code|coded]] by DNA genes and made via [[messenger RNA]] intermediates and [[ribosome]]s.
* Metabolism, including taking in raw materials, building cell components, converting energy, [[molecule]]s and releasing [[by-product]]s. The functioning of a cell depends upon its ability to extract and use chemical energy stored in organic molecules. This energy is derived from [[metabolic pathway]]s.
* Response to external and internal [[signal transduction|stimuli]] such as changes in temperature, [[pH]] or nutrient levels.
* Cell contents are contained within a [[cell membrane|cell surface membrane]] that contains proteins and a [[lipid bilayer]].

===Last universal common ancestor===
[[File:Stromatolites.jpg|thumb|[[Precambrian]] [[stromatolite]]s in the Siyeh Formation, [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]]. In 2002, a paper in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggested that these 3.5 [[Billion years|Gya]] (billion years old) [[geological formation]]s contain fossilized [[cyanobacteria]] microbes. This suggests they are evidence of one of the earliest known life forms on Earth.]]

Information about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including [[geology]] and [[planetary science]]. These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of [[time]].

All organisms are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly.

There is strong evidence from genetics that all organisms have a common ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of [[nucleic acid]]s as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty [[amino acid]]s as the building blocks for [[protein]]s. All organisms use the same [[genetic code]] (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to [[translation (genetics)|translate]] nucleic acid sequences into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection of many of these traits seems arbitrary. [[Horizontal gene transfer]] makes it more difficult to study the last universal ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doolittle |first1=W.

Research published in 2016, by [[William F.

In prokaryotes, [[Transformation (genetics)#Natural transformation|natural bacterial transformation]] involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and integration of the donor DNA into the recipient chromosome by recombination. Natural bacterial transformation is considered to be a primitive sexual process and occurs in both bacteria and archaea, although it has been studied mainly in bacteria. Transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation and not an accidental occurrence, because it depends on numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other to enter a state of [[natural competence]] to perform this complex process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chen I |author2=Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15083159 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro844 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformation is a common mode of DNA transfer among prokaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnsborg O |author2=Eldholm V |author3=Håvarstein LS |title=Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function |journal=Res.

===Horizontal gene transfer===
{{main|Horizontal gene transfer}}
The ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sequence comparisons suggest recent [[horizontal gene transfer|horizontal transfer]] of many genes among diverse [[species]] including across the boundaries of [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma State – [https://web.archive.org/web/19990220101406/http://opbs.okstate.edu/%7Emelcher/MG/MGW3/MG334.html Horizontal Gene Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biologist Peter Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research", therefore "biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Gogarten |url=http://www.esalenctr.org/display/confpage.cfm?confid=10&amp;pageid=105&amp;pgtype=1 |title=Horizontal Gene Transfer - A New Paradigm for Biology |publisher=esalenctr.org |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future of life (cloning and synthetic organisms)===
Modern biotechnology is challenging traditional concepts of organism and species. [[Cloning]] is the process of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another, with the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Cloning is the subject of [[ethics of cloning|much ethical debate]].

In 2008, the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] assembled a synthetic [[Bacterial genome size|bacterial genome]], ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. ''The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments.''&lt;ref name=Venter&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibsona, Daniel G. |author2=Benders, Gwynedd A. |author3=Axelroda, Kevin C. |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=One-step assembly in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments to form a complete synthetic Mycoplasma genitalium genome |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=51 |pages=20404–20409 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/51/20404.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.0811011106 |pmid=19073939 |pmc=2600582|bibcode=2008PNAS..10520404G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies, such as [[Synthetic Genomics]], have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.

A '''pest house''', '''plague house''', '''pesthouse''' or '''fever shed''' was a type of building used for persons afflicted with [[communicable disease]]s such as [[tuberculosis]], [[cholera]], [[smallpox]] or [[typhus]]. Often used for forcible [[quarantine]], many towns and cities had one or more pesthouses accompanied by a cemetery or a waste pond nearby for disposal of the dead.

==Fever sheds in Canada==
{{main|Typhus epidemic of 1847}}
Fever sheds were built in several communities across [[Eastern Canada]] in 1847, to quarantine sick and dying [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, who contracted [[typhus]] during the voyage to the New World during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].
===Montreal===
In [[Montreal]], between 3,500 and 6,000 Irish immigrants died in fever sheds in a quarantine area known as [[Goose Village, Montreal|Windmill Point]]. Three sheds were initially constructed,{{convert|150|ft|m}} long by 40 to {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide. As thousands more sick immigrants landed, more sheds had to be erected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallagher |first=The Reverend John A. |year=1936 |title=The Irish Emigration of 1847 and Its Canadian Consequences|journal=CCHA Report, University of Manitoba Web Site|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1935-36/Gallagher.html|accessdate=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of sheds would grow to 22, with troops cordoning off the area so the sick could not escape.&lt;ref name="Bruemmer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://montrealnewsinfo.blogspot.com/2009/05/seeking-hope-they-found-death.html|title=Seeking hope, they found death|last=Bruemmer|first=Rene|date=2009-05-30|work=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Canwest|accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto===
In [[Toronto]], during the summer of 1847, 863 Irish immigrants died of typhus at fever sheds built by the [[Toronto Board of Health]] at the northwest corner of [[King Street (Toronto)|King]] and [[John Street (Toronto)|John Street]]. There were at least 12 sheds, 22 metres long by 7.5 metres wide. &lt;ref name=toplaques&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto's Historical Plaques|url=http://www.torontoplaques.com/Pages_GHI/Irish_Immigrants_and_the_Fever_Sheds.html|website=Irish Immigrants and the Fever Sheds 1847|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=BlogTO&gt;{{cite news|title=The UnderTOw: The Fever Sheds|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2007/04/the_undertow_the_fever_sheds/|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=BlogTO|date=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint John, New Brunswick===
[[Partridge Island, New Brunswick]], just outside the main harbour of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], was chosen as the location for a pest house and quarantine station as far back as 1785. In 1847, with a large influx of Irish migrants, the typhus epidemic quickly filled the fever shed with sick and dying. By the 1847 typhus season, 2115 people had died in New Brunswick, with 1196 dying at Partridge Island and in Saint John.&lt;ref name=mccord&gt;{{cite web|title=1967.25A-C {{!}} Partridge Island|url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/1967.25A-C|website=[[McCord Museum]]|accessdate=22 January 2012|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Aaberg''' (born April 8, 1949) is an American [[pianist]] and [[composer]].&lt;ref name=aaberg&gt;{{cite news|title=Philip Aaberg Plays for Fine Arts Series Finale|newspaper=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/arts_and_entertainment/sounds/article_afaf9cc0-66d7-11e0-a00c-001cc4c002e0.html|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained international recognition through a series of successful piano recordings released on [[Windham Hill Records]]. Although classically trained, Aaberg incorporates [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz music|jazz]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], rock, and new music elements into his compositions and musical structures.&lt;ref name="Sweetgrass Music"&gt;[http://www.sweetgrassmusic.com Sweetgrass Music].&lt;/ref&gt; Although best known for his solo piano work, he is most at home in the [[chamber jazz]] genre. His compositions are noted for their "rigorous keyboard technique, diverse influences, and colorful compositional style."&lt;ref name=aaberg2&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=q71083|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Philip Aaberg|last=Kohanov|first=Linda|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Philip Aaberg was born in [[Havre, Montana]] in 1949 and raised in [[Chester, Montana]].&lt;ref name=aaberg2/&gt; By the age of 14, he was performing with local bands at dances.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Will. ''Upright'' by Philip Aaberg. Liner Notes.&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in music from [[Harvard University]], he moved to [[Oakland, California]] and played in blues clubs for several years.&lt;ref name="Kohanov"&gt;Kohanov&lt;/ref&gt; He also toured and recorded as a member of [[Elvin Bishop]]'s Group at the time of its greatest popularity, and co-wrote the title song of the band's 1976 ''Struttin' My Stuff'' release, an album which also included Bishop's biggest hit, "Fooled Around and Fell in Love," featuring Aaberg on piano.

== Windham Hill years ==

In 1985, Aaberg signed a recording contract with [[Windham Hill Records]] and released the highly acclaimed solo album ''High Plains'' that showcased his eclectic musical background. He followed this up with seven more solo albums:'' Out of the Frame'' (1988), ''Upright ''(1989), ''Cinema'' (1992), ''Field Notes'' (2000), ''Live from Montana'' (2000), which received a Grammy nomination, ''Christmas'' (2002), and ''Blue West'' (2005).  Aaberg also appeared regularly on the popular Windham Hill Sampler albums over the past 20 years and has had success in various collaborations and ensemble projects.&lt;ref name="Kohanov"/&gt;

Aaberg has performed with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] and has appeared at the Marlboro Chamber Music Festival. As a guest artist, he has performed on over 200 albums and on PBS's All-American Jazz program, which earned him an [[Emmy Award]] nomination. He has appeared with [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Tom Johnston (musician)|Tom Johnston]] of the [[The Doobie Brothers|Doobie Brothers]] in concert.&lt;ref name="Kohanov"/&gt;

== Sweetgrass Music years ==

In 2000, Aaberg began his own record label with his wife Patty, Sweetgrass Music, through which he has since endeavored to produce music that "connects a global audience to the sweeping landscape of the West." Throughout his career, Aaberg has produced music that consistently translated Montana's farms, ranches, and native cultures into "musical concepts" and has "forged a unique keyboard style that paints an audible portrait of his home state."&lt;ref name="Sweetgrass Music"/&gt; Philip also produces a public radio program "Of the West: Creativity and Sense of Place." www.ofthewest.net   He received a Montana Governor's Award for the Arts and in 2011, received a Montana Arts Council Innovator Award. His score for "Class C: The Only Game in Town" was nominated for a regional Emmy. Philip and his wife, Patty, run Sweetgrass Music, the Great Northern Bed and Breakfast, the Westland Suite, and The Bin (recording studio).

'''Rational egoism''' (also called '''rational selfishness''') is the principle that an action is rational if and only if it maximizes one's self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Baier (1990), p. 201; Gert (1998), p. 69; Shaver (2002), §3; Moseley (2006), §2.&lt;/ref&gt; The view is a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] form of [[wikt:egoism|egoism]]. It is distinct from [[psychological egoism]] (according to which people are ''motivated'' only to act in their own self-interest) and [[ethical egoism]] (that moral agents ''ought'' only to do what is in their own self-interest).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] in the 1863 book ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Walicki|author2=Hilda Andrews-Rusiecka|title=A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev4ad5wKI9oC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1979|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1132-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chernyshevsky's standpoint was ultimately socialistic, and was criticised by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in the 1864 book ''[[Notes from Underground]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case against Rational Egoism in Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground |author=James P. Scanlan |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=July 1999 |pages=549–67 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1999.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/context.html |title=SparkNotes: Notes from Underground: Context |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[SparkNotes]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] discussed rational egoism in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', first published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; A method of ethics is "any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought' – or what it is 'right' for them – to do, or seek to realize by voluntary action".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick considers three such procedures, namely, rational egoism, dogmatic intuitionism, and [[utilitarianism]]. Rational egoism is the view that, if rational, "an agent regards quantity of consequent pleasure and pain to himself alone important in choosing between alternatives of action; and seeks always the greatest attainable surplus of pleasure over pain".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidgwick found it difficult to find any persuasive reason for preferring rational egoism over [[utilitarianism]]. Although utilitarianism can be provided with a rational basis and reconciled with the morality of common sense, rational egoism appears to be an equally plausible doctrine regarding what we have most reason to do. Thus we must "admit an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct; and from this admission it would seem to follow that the apparently intuitive operation of Practical Reason, manifested in these contradictory judgments, is after all illusory".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand ==
The author and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] also discusses a theory that she called 'rational egoism'. She holds that it is both irrational and immoral to act against one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006); Moseley (2006), §2a.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her view is a conjunction of both rational egoism (in the standard sense) and [[ethical egoism]], because according to [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]], egoism cannot be properly justified without an [[epistemology]] based on [[rationality|reason]]:

Her book ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964) explains the concept of rational egoism in depth. According to Rand, a rational man holds his own life as his highest value, rationality as his highest [[virtue]], and his happiness as the final purpose of his life.

Conversely, Rand was sharply critical of the [[ethical altruism|ethical doctrine of altruism]]:

{{quote|Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is ''self-sacrifice'' – which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction – which means the ''self'' as a standard of evil, the ''selfless'' as a standard of the good.
Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. The issue is whether you ''do'' or do ''not'' have the right to exist ''without'' giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: ''No.'' Altruism says: ''Yes.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs it'', 1982, New American Library, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Two objections to rational egoism are given by the English philosopher [[Derek Parfit]], who discusses the theory at length in ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;D. Parfit (1984), parts II and III&lt;/ref&gt; First, from the rational egoist point of view, it is rational to contribute to a [[pension scheme]] now, even though this is detrimental to one's present interests (which are to spend the money now). But it seems equally reasonable to maximize one's interests now, given that one's reasons are not only relative to him, but to him as he is now (and not his future self, who is argued to be a "different" person). Parfit also argues that since the connections between the present mental state and the mental state of one's future self may decrease, it is not plausible to claim that one should be indifferent between one's present and future self.

The "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]" model of [[evolution]] suggests that human (and animal) behaviors that seem altruistic are actually selfish, if viewed from the perspective of [[Gene|genes]]/[[Phenotype|phenotypes]].  People help each other "selflessly" because copies of their own genes also exist in others, so behaviors that help the genes survive are [[Natural selection|selected]] for, with the altruistic drive [[Kin selection|decreasing with genetic distance]].

'''Semelparity''' and '''iteroparity''' are two classes of possible reproductive strategies available to living organisms.  A species is considered semelparous if it is characterized by a single reproductive episode before death, and iteroparous if it is characterized by multiple reproductive cycles over the course of its lifetime.  Some [[Botany|botanists]] use the parallel terms [[monocarpy]] and [[polycarpy]]. (See also [[plietesials]].)

In truly semelparous species, death after reproduction is part of an overall strategy that includes putting all available resources into maximizing reproduction, at the expense of future life (see "[[#Trade-offs|Trade-offs]]", below). In any iteroparous population there will be some individuals who die between their first and second reproductive episodes, but unless this is part of a syndrome of programmed death after reproduction, this would not be called semelparity.

This distinction is also related to the difference between [[annual plant|annual]] and [[perennial plant|perennial]] plants.  An annual is a plant that completes its life cycle in a single season, and is usually semelparous. Perennials live for more than one season and are usually (but not always) iteroparous.&lt;ref&gt;Gotelli, Nicholas J. (2008). ''A Primer of Ecology.''

Semelparity and iteroparity are not, strictly speaking, alternative strategies, but extremes along a continuum of possible modes of reproduction. Many organisms considered to be semelparous can, under certain conditions, separate their single bout of reproduction into two or more episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facultative Second Oviposition as an Adaptation to Egg Loss in a Semelparous Crab Spider|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01126.x/abstract|journal = Ethology|date = 2005-12-01|issn = 1439-0310|pages = 1126–1138|volume = 111|issue = 12|doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01126.x|first = Kyoko|last = Futami|first2 = Shin-ichi|last2 = Akimoto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changing reproductive effort within a semelparous reproductive episode|url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/8/1323|journal = American Journal of Botany|date = 2014-08-01|issn = 0002-9122|pmid = 25156981|pages = 1323–1331|volume = 101|issue = 8|doi = 10.3732/ajb.1400283|first = P.

==Overview==

===Semelparity===

[[File:Oncorhynchus nerka 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] is an example of a semelparous organism]]The word semelparity was coined by evolutionary biologist Lamont Cole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=Lamont C.|title=The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=June 1954|volume=29|issue=2|pages=103–137|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2817654?uid=3739920&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102442342007|accessdate=June 22, 2013|doi=10.1086/400074}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comes from the Latin ''semel'' 'once, a single time' and ''pario'' 'to beget'. This differs from&amp;nbsp;iteroparity&amp;nbsp;in that iteroparous species are able to have multiple reproductive cycles and therefore can mate more than once in their lifetime. Semelparity is also known as "big bang" reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large as well as fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Ricklefs and Gary Leon Miller (1999). ''Ecology.'' Macmillan {{ISBN|0-7167-2829-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A classic example of a semelparous organism is Pacific salmon (''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' spp.), which lives for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and dying. Other semelparous animals include many insects, including some species of butterflies, cicadas, and [[mayfly|mayflies]], many [[arachnids]], and some molluscs such as some species of [[squid]] and [[octopus]].

Semelparity also occurs in [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] and [[capelin]], but is very rare in vertebrates other than bony fish.

This form of lifestyle is consistent with&amp;nbsp;[[R/K selection theory|r-selected]]&amp;nbsp;strategies as many offspring are produced and there is low parental input, as one or both parents die after mating. All of the male’s energy is diverting into mating and the immune system is repressed. High levels of&amp;nbsp;[[corticosteroid]]s&amp;nbsp;are sustained over long periods of time. This triggers immune and inflammatory system failure and&amp;nbsp;[[Gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhage]], which eventually leads to death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oakwood|first=Meri|last2=Bradley|first2=Adrian J.|last3=Cockburn|first3=Andrew|date=2001-02-22|title=Semelparity in a large marsupial|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1465/407|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=268|issue=1465|pages=407–411|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1369|issn=0962-8452|pmid=11270438|pmc=1088621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iteroparity===

[[File:Sow with piglet.jpg|thumb| An iteroparous organism is one that can undergo many reproductive events throughout its lifetime. The [[pig]] is an example of an iteroparous organism]]The term iteroparity comes from the Latin ''itero'', to repeat, and ''pario'', to beget.  An example of an iteroparous organism is a human—though people may choose to have only one child (or even none), humans are biologically capable of having offspring many times over the course of their lives.

Iteroparous vertebrates include all birds, most reptiles, virtually all mammals, and most fish. Among invertebrates, most mollusca and many insects (for example, mosquitoes and cockroaches) are iteroparous.  Most perennial plants are iteroparous.

==Models==

===Trade-offs===
It is a biological precept that within its lifetime an organism has a limited amount of energy/resources available to it, and must always partition it among various functions such as collecting food and finding a mate.  Of relevance here is the trade-off between [[fecundity]], growth, and survivorship in its [[life history theory|life history]] strategy. These trade-offs come into play in the evolution of iteroparity and semelparity.  It has been repeatedly demonstrated that semelparous species produce more offspring in their single fatal reproductive episode than do closely related iteroparous species in any one of theirs.  However, the opportunity to reproduce more than once in a lifetime, and possibly with greater care for the development of offspring produced, can offset this strictly numerical benefit.

===Models based on non-linear trade-offs===

[[File:reproductive effort iteroparous.svg|thumb|right|Iteroparous reproductive effort]]
One class of models that tries to explain the differential evolution of semelparity and iteroparity examines the shape of the trade-off between offspring produced and offspring forgone.  In [[economic]] terms, offspring produced is equivalent to a [[cost-benefit analysis|benefit]] function, while offspring forgone is comparable to a [[cost]] function.  The reproductive effort of an organism—the proportion of energy that it puts into reproducing, as opposed to growth or survivorship—occurs at the point where the distance between offspring produced and offspring forgone is the greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Moorcroft, "Life History Strategies" (lecture, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 9 February 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  The accompanying graph shows the offspring-produced and offspring-forgone curves for an iteroparous organism:  
[[File:reproductive effort semelparous.jpg|thumb|right|Semelparous reproductive effort]]

In the first graph, the [[marginal cost]] of offspring produced is decreasing (each additional offspring is less "expensive" than the average of all previous offspring) and the marginal cost of offspring forgone is increasing.  In this situation, the organism only devotes a portion of its resources to reproduction, and uses the rest of its resources on growth and survivorship so that it can reproduce again in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Roff, Derek A. (1992). ''The Evolution of Life Histories''. Springer {{ISBN|0-412-02391-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is also possible (second graph) for the marginal cost of offspring produced to ''increase'', and for the marginal cost of offspring forgone to decrease.  When this is the case, it is favorable for the organism to reproduce a single time. The organism devotes all of its resources to that one episode of reproduction, so it then dies. This mathematical/graphical model has found only limited quantitative support from nature.

===Bet-hedging models===
A second set of models examines the possibility that iteroparity is a [[Bet-hedging (biology)|hedge]] against unpredictable juvenile survivorship (avoiding putting all one's eggs in one basket).  Again, mathematical models have not found empirical support from real-world systems.  In fact, many semelparous species live in habitats characterized by high (not low) environmental unpredictability, such as deserts and early successional habitats.

===Cole's paradox and demographic models===

The models that have the strongest support from living systems are demographic. In Lamont Cole's classic 1954 paper, he came to the conclusion that: {{Quote|For an annual species, the absolute gain in intrinsic population growth which could be achieved by changing to the perennial reproductive habit would be exactly equivalent to adding one individual to the average litter size.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont C. Cole. "The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena." ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 29, no. 2 (June 1954): 103-137&lt;/ref&gt;}}
For example, imagine two species—an iteroparous species that has annual litters averaging three offspring each, and a semelparous species that has one litter of four, and then dies.  These two species have the same rate of population growth, which suggests that even a tiny fecundity advantage of one additional offspring would favor the evolution of semelparity. This is known as Cole's paradox.

In his analysis, Cole assumed that there was no mortality of individuals of the iteroparous species, even seedlings. Twenty years later, Charnov and Schaffer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charnov | first1 = E.L. | last2 = Schaffer | first2 = W.M. | year = 1973 | title = Life history consequences of natural selection: Cole's result revisited | url = http://repository.unm.edu/bitstream/1928/1696/2/AN1973.pdf| journal = American Naturalist | volume = 107 | issue = | pages = 791–793 | doi=10.1086/282877}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that reasonable differences in adult and juvenile mortality yield much more reasonable costs of semelparity, essentially solving Cole's paradox.  An even more general demographic model was produced by Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = T.P. | year = 1981 | title = A general model of comparative fecundity for semelparous and iteroparous life histories | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 118 | issue = | pages = 27–36 | doi=10.1086/283798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These demographic models have been more successful than the other models when tested with real-world systems. It has been shown that semelparous species have higher expected adult mortality, making it more economical to put all reproductive effort into the first (and therefore final) reproductive episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = T.P. | year = 1990 | title = The evolution of semelparity in Mount Kenya lobelias | url = | journal = Evolutionary Ecology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 157–171 | doi=10.1007/bf02270913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lesica | first1 = P. | last2 = Young | first2 = T.P. | year = 2005 | title = Demographic model explains life history evolution in Arabis fecunda | url = | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 471–477 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.00972.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Dasyuridae ====

===== Small Dasyuridae =====

[[File:Phascogale calura close.jpg|thumb|''Phascogale calura'']]
Semelparous species of [[Dasyuridae]] are typically small and carnivorous, with the exception of the northern quoll (''[[Northern quoll|Dasyurus hallucatus]]''), which is large. Species with this reproductive strategy include members of the genus&amp;nbsp;''[[Antechinus]],&amp;nbsp;[[Brush-tailed phascogale|Phascogale tapoatafa]]''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''[[Red-tailed phascogale|Phascogale culura]]''. The males of all three groups exhibit similar characteristics that classify them as semelparous. First, all of the males of each species disappear immediately after the mating season. Also, males that are captured and isolated from others live for 2 to 3 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woolley|first=Patricia|date=1966-01-01|title=Reproduction in Antechinus spp. and other Dasyurid marsupials|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282331976_Reproduction_in_Antechinus_spp_and_other_Dasyurid_marsupials|journal=Symposia of the Zoological Society of London|volume=15|pages=281–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these captured males are allowed to mate, they die immediately after the mating season, like those in the wild. Their behavior also changes drastically before and after the mating season. Before mating, males are extremely aggressive and will fight with other males if placed close together. Males that are captured before they are allowed to mate remain aggressive through the winter months. After the mating season, if allowed to mate, males become extremely lethargic and never regain their aggressiveness even if they survive to the next mating season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other changes that occur post-mating include fur degradation and testicular degeneration. During adolescence, male fur is thick and becomes dull and thin after mating, but regains its original condition if the individual manages to survive past the mating season. The fur on the scrotum completely falls off and does not grow back, even if the male survives months after the first mating season. As the marsupial ages, its testicles grow until they reach a peak size and weight at the beginning of the mating season. After the individual mates, the weight and size of the testes and scrotum decrease. They remain small and do not produce&amp;nbsp;[[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]&amp;nbsp;later in life, if maintained in a laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 1966 Woolley study on&amp;nbsp;''Antechinus spp.''&amp;nbsp;noticed that males were only able to be maintained past mating in the laboratory and no senile males were found in the wild, suggesting that all males die shortly after mating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Corticosteroid concentration and increased male mortality =====

[[File:Antechinus stuartii.jpg|thumb|''Antechinus stuartii'']]
Studies on&amp;nbsp;''[[Brown antechinus|Antechinus stuartii]]''&amp;nbsp;reveal that male mortality is highly correlated to stress and&amp;nbsp;[[Adrenocortical hormone|andrenocortica]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l activity. The study measured the&amp;nbsp;[[corticosteroid]]&amp;nbsp;concentration in males in the wild, males injected with cortisol, males injected with saline, and females in the wild. While both males and females exhibit high levels of corticosteroid concentration in the wild, this proves fatal only to males due to females having a higher maximum high affinity corticosteroid binding capacity (MCBC).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=A.J.|last2=McDonald|first2=I.R.|last3=Lee|first3=A.K.|title=Stress and mortality in a small marsupial (Antechinus stuartii, Macleay)|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-6480(80)90122-7|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=188–200|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(80)90122-7|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, free corticosteroid in the&amp;nbsp;[[Blood plasma|plasma]]&amp;nbsp;of male&amp;nbsp;''A. stuartii''&amp;nbsp;rises sharply, while it remains constant in females. High levels of free corticosteroid, resulting from mating in wild males and injected cortisol in laboratory males, resulted in&amp;nbsp;[[Peptic ulcer disease|stomach ulcers]],&amp;nbsp;[[Gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal hemorrhaging]], and&amp;nbsp;[[liver abscess]]es, all of which increased mortality. These side effects were not found in the males that were injected with saline,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; strengthening the hypothesis that high free corticosteroids results in higher morality in male&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids''. A similar study on&amp;nbsp;''Phascogale calura''&amp;nbsp;showed that similar&amp;nbsp;[[endocrine system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;changes happen in&amp;nbsp;''P. calura''&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;''A. stuartii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=A. J.|date=July 1987|title=Stress and mortality in the red-tailed phascogale, Phascogale calura (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae)|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|volume=67|issue=1|pages=85–100|issn=0016-6480|pmid=3623073|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(87)90208-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports stress-induced mortality as a characteristic of small&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurid''&amp;nbsp;semelparity.

===== Large Dasyuridae =====

[[File:Dasyurus hallucatus -Queensland-8.jpg|thumb|''Dasyurus hallucatus'']]
''[[Northern quoll|Dasyurus hallucatus]]'', or the northern quoll, is a large&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurid''&amp;nbsp;and exhibits increased male mortality after the mating season. Unlike smaller&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids'', male die-off in&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;is not due to endocrine system changes and there was no&amp;nbsp;[[Spermatogenesis|spermatogenic failure]]&amp;nbsp;after the mating season ended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If male&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;survive past their first mating season, they may be able to engage in a second mating season. While the individuals in a 2001 study mostly died from vehicles or predation, researchers found evidence of physiological degradation in males, similar to the physiological degradation in small&amp;nbsp;''Dasyurids.''&amp;nbsp;This includes fur loss, parasite infestations, and weight loss. As the mating period went on, males became increasingly&amp;nbsp;[[Anemia|anemic]], but the anemia was not due to&amp;nbsp;[[ulcer]]ation&amp;nbsp;or gastrointestinal bleeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lack of elevated cortisol levels during mating periods in&amp;nbsp;''D. hallucatus''&amp;nbsp;means that there is no current universal explanation for the mechanism behind increased male mortality in&amp;nbsp;''Dasyuridae.''&amp;nbsp;Post-reproductive [[senescence]]&amp;nbsp;has also been proposed as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, A. "Living slow and dying young: senescence in marsupials."&amp;nbsp;''Marsupial Biology: Recent Research, New Perspectives. University of New South Wales Press, Sydney''&amp;nbsp;(1997): 163-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In opossums ====

===== Grey slender mouse opossum (''Marmosa incana'') =====
[[File:Flickr - ggallice - Mouse opossum.jpg|thumb|''Mouse opossum'']]
The [[Marmosa|mouse opossum]] exhibits a semelparous reproductive strategy in males and females. Males disappear from their&amp;nbsp;[[Endemism|endemic area]]&amp;nbsp;after the reproductive season (February–May). Males found months later (June–August) are of lighter body weight and the molar teeth are less worn down, suggesting these males belong to a different generation. There is a drop off in the female population, but during the months of July and August, evidence of a gap between generations like the male gap. There is also lower body weight and less molar wear observed in females found after August. This is further supported by the evidence that females that reproduce are not observed the following year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lucia, Maria. "Annual age structure and reproductive patterns in Marmosa incana (Lund, 1841)(Didelphidae, Marsupialia)." (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This species has been compared to a similarly related species&amp;nbsp;''[[Robinson's mouse opossum|Marmosa robinsoni]]''&amp;nbsp;and like&amp;nbsp;''M. incana''&amp;nbsp;in order to answer what would happen if a female that has reproduced were to survive to the next mating season.&amp;nbsp;''M. robinsoni''&amp;nbsp;has a&amp;nbsp;[[Estrous cycle|monoestrus]]&amp;nbsp;reproductive cycle, like&amp;nbsp;''M. incana'', and females are no longer fertile after 17 months so it is unlikely that females that survive past the drop off in female populations would be able to reproduce a second time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Catita (Gracilinanus microtarsus) - Leonardo Merçon.jpg|thumb|''Gracilinanus microtarsus'']]
Other mouse opossums

''[[Brazilian gracile opossum|Gracilinanus microtarsus]]'', or the Brazilian gracile opossum, is considered to be partially semelparous because male mortality increases significantly after the mating season, but some males survive to mate again in the next reproductive cycle. The males also exhibit similar physiological degradation demonstrated in&amp;nbsp;''Antechinus''and other semelparous&amp;nbsp;[[marsupial]]s&amp;nbsp;such as fur loss and increase of infection from parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Eduardo G.|last2=Bonato|first2=Vinícius|last3=da-Silva|first3=Cibele Q.|last4=Reis|first4=Dos|last5=F|first5=Sérgio|date=2006-10-17|title=Partial Semelparity in the Neotropical Didelphid Marsupial Gracilinanus microtarsus|url=https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/87/5/915/900694|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=87|issue=5|pages=915–920|doi=10.1644/05-mamm-a-403r1.1|issn=0022-2372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semelparity in fish ===

==== Pacific salmon ====
Highly elevated cortisol levels mediate the post-spawning death of semelparous ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'' Pacific salmon by causing tissue degeneration, suppressing the immune system, and impairing various homeostatic mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-629060-8.50017-5|title=SALMONIDS AND ANNUAL FISHES: DEATH AFTER SEX|last=Dickhoff|first=Walton W.|pages=253–266|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-629060-8.50017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After swimming for such a long distance, salmon expend all of their energy on reproduction. One of the key factors in salmon rapid [[senescence]] is that these fish do not feed during reproduction so body weight is extremely reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morbey|first=Yolanda E.|last2=Brassil|first2=Chad E.|last3=Hendry|first3=Andrew P.|title=Rapid Senescence in Pacific Salmon|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1086/491720|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=166|issue=5|pages=556–568|doi=10.1086/491720|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to physiological degradation, pacific salmon become more lethargic as mating goes on, which makes some individuals more susceptible to predation because they have less energy to avoid predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gende|first=Scott M.|last2=Quinn|first2=Thomas P.|last3=Hilborn|first3=Ray|last4=Hendry|first4=Andrew P.|last5=Dickerson|first5=Bobette|date=2004-03-01|title=Brown bears selectively kill salmon with higher energy content but only in habitats that facilitate choice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x/abstract|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=104|issue=3|pages=518–528|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12762.x|issn=1600-0706}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also increases mortality rates of adults post-mating.

=== Semelparity in insects ===
[[File:Gypsy Moth (35955436354).jpg|thumb|Gypsy Moth]]
Traditionally,&amp;nbsp;semelparity was usually defined within the time frame of a year. Critics of this criterion note that this scale is inappropriate in discussing patterns of insect reproduction because many insects breed more than once within one annual period, but generation times of less than one year. Under the traditional definition, insects are considered semelparous as a consequence of time scale rather than the distribution of reproductive effort over their adult life span.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritz|first=Robert S.|last2=Stamp|first2=Nancy E.|last3=Halverson|first3=Timothy G.|date=1982|title=Iteroparity and Semelparity in Insects|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=120|issue=2|pages=264–268|doi=10.1086/283987|jstor=2461222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to resolve this inconsistency, Fritz ''et. al'' define semelparous insects as "Insects that lay a single [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch of eggs]] in their lifetime and deposit them at one place are clearly semelparous or big bang reproducers. Their entire reproductive effort is committed at one time and they die shortly after [[Oviparity|oviposition]]".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Semelparous insects are found in [[Lepidoptera]], [[Mayfly|Ephemeroptera]], [[Earwig|Dermaptera]], [[Plecoptera]], [[Strepsiptera]], [[Caddisfly|Trichoptera]], and [[Homoptera]].

==== Examples in Lepidoptera ====
Females of certain families of Lepidoptera, like the [[Lymantria dispar|Gypsy Moth]] of ''[[Bagworm moth|Psychidae]],'' have reduced mobility or [[Aptery|apterous]] so the insects' dispersal is in the larval stage, as opposed to in the adult stage. In iteroparous insects, major dispersal occurs in the adult stage. All semelparous Lepidopterans share similar characteristics: Larva only feed in restricted periods of the year because of the nutritional state of their host plants (as a result, they are [[univoltine]]), initial food supply is predictably abundant, and larval host plants are abundant and adjacent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Death most commonly occurs by starvation. In the case of the gypsy moth, adults do not possess an active digestive system and cannot feed, but can drink moisture. Mating occurs fairly rapidly after adults emerge from their [[pupa]]l form and, without a way to digest food, the adult moths die after about a week.&lt;ref&gt;The Gypsy Moth: Research Toward Integrated Pest Management, United States Department of Agriculture, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agile Antechinus (Antechinus agilis) showing offspring inside.jpg|thumb|''Antechinus agilis'' showing offspring inside pouch]]
The evolution for semelparity in both sexes has occurred many times in plants, invertebrates, and fish. It is rare in mammals because mammals have obligate maternal care due to&amp;nbsp;[[internal fertilization]]&amp;nbsp;and incubation of offspring and nursing young after birth, which requires high maternal survival rate after fertilization and offspring&amp;nbsp;[[weaning]]. Also, female mammals have relatively low reproductive rate compared to invertebrates or fish because they invest a lot of energy in maternal care. However, male reproductive rate is much less constrained in mammals because only females bear young. Males that die after one mating season can still produce a large number of offspring if he invests all of his energy in intense matings with many females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Diana O.|last2=Dickman|first2=Christopher R.|last3=Jones|first3=Menna E.|last4=Blomberg|first4=Simon P.|date=2013-10-29|title=Sperm competition drives the evolution of suicidal reproduction in mammals|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/44/17910|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=110|issue=44|pages=17910–17914|doi=10.1073/pnas.1310691110|issn=0027-8424|pmid=24101455|pmc=3816400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in mammals ====
Scientists have hypothesized that natural selection has allowed semelparity to evolved in&amp;nbsp;''Dasyuridae''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''Didelphidae''&amp;nbsp;because of certain ecological constraints. Female mammals ancestral to this these groups may have shortened their mating period to coincide with peak prey abundance. Because this window is so small, the females of these species exhibit a reproduction pattern where the&amp;nbsp;[[Estrous cycle|estrous]]&amp;nbsp;of all females occurs simultaneously. Selection would then favor aggressive males due to increased competition between males for access to females. Since the mating period is so short, it is more beneficial for males to expend all their energy on mating, even more so if they are unlikely to survive to the next mating season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=Richard W.|last2=Lee|first2=Anthony K.|date=1979|title=A Mammalian Example of Semelparity|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=113|issue=1|pages=151–155|doi=10.1086/283372|jstor=2459950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in fish ====
[[File:Dead salmon in spawning season.jpg|thumb|Dead salmon after spawning]]
Reproduction is costly for [[Fish migration|anadromous]] [[Salmonidae|salmonids]] because their life history requires transition from saltwater to freshwater streams and long migrations, which can be physiologically taxing. The transition between cold oceanic water to warm freshwater and steep elevation changes in Northern Paciﬁc rivers could explain the evolution of semelparity because it would be extremely difficult to return to the ocean. A noticeable difference between semelparous fish and iteroparous salmonids is that egg size varies between the two types of reproductive strategies. Studies show that egg size is also affected by migration and body size. Egg number, however shows little variation between semelparous and iteroparous populations or between resident and anadromous populations for females of the same body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/ele.12607/abstract|doi=10.1111/ele.12607}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current hypothesis behind this reason is that iteroparous species reduce the size of their eggs in order to improve the mother's chances survival, since she invests less energy in gamete formation. Semelparous species do not expect to live past one mating season, so females invest a lot more energy in gamete formation resulting in large eggs. Anadromous salmonids may also have evolved semelparity to boost the nutrition density of the [[Spawn (biology)|spawning grounds]]. The most productive Pacific salmon spawning grounds contain the most carcasses of spawned adults. The dead bodies of the adult salmon decompose and provide nitrogen and phosphorus for [[algae]] to grow in the nutrient-poor water. [[Zooplankton]] then feed on the algae, and newly-hatched salmon feed on the zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0677-4_7|title=Freshwaters of Alaska|last=Kline|first=Thomas C.|last2=Goering|first2=John J.|last3=Piorkowski|first3=Robert J.|date=1997|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=9781461268666|series=Ecological Studies|pages=179–204|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0677-4_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution in insects ====
[[File:Earwig guarding eggs.jpg|thumb|Earwig guarding eggs]]
An interesting trait has evolved in semelparous insects, especially in those that have evolved from [[Parasitism|parasitic]] ancestors, like in all subsocial and [[Eusocial insect|eusocial]] [[Aculeata|aculeate]] [[Hymenoptera]]. This is because larvae are morphologically specialized for development within a host's innards and thus are entirely helpless outside of that environment. Females would need to invest a lot of energy in protecting their eggs and hatched offspring. They do this through such behaviors as egg guarding. Mothers that actively defend offspring, for example, risk injury or death by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TALLAMY|first=DOUGLAS W.|last2=BROWN|first2=WILLIAM P.|title=Semelparity and the evolution of maternal care in insects|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1998.1008|journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=57|issue=3|pages=727–730|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.1008|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not beneficial in an iteroparous species because the female risks dying and not reaching her full reproductive potential by not being able to reproduce in all reproductive periods in her lifetime. Since semelparous insects only live for one reproductive cycle, they can afford to expend energy on maternal care because those offspring are her only offspring. An iteroparous insect does not need to expend energy on the eggs of one mating period because it is likely that she will mate again. There is ongoing research in maternal care in semelparous insects from lineages not descended from parasites to further understand this relationship between semelparity and maternal care.

'''Sequential hermaphroditism''' (called '''dichogamy''' in [[botany]]) is a type of [[hermaphroditism]] that occurs in many [[fish]], [[gastropod]]s, and plants. Sequential hermaphroditism occurs when the individual changes sex at some point in its life. 

In animals, the different types of change are male to female ('''protandry'''), female to male ('''protogyny'''),&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt; female to hermaphrodite ('''protogynous hermaphroditism'''), and male to hermaphrodite ('''protandrous hermaphroditism'''). Those that change gonadal sex can have both female and male germ cells in the [[gonad]]s or can change from one complete gonadal type to the other during their last life stage.&lt;ref name='carauth'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Freshwater cichlid ''Crenicara punctulata'' is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite | journal=Copeia | year=2000 | first=L. L. | last=Carruth | volume=2000 | pages=71–82 | doi=10.1643/0045-8511(2000)2000[0071:fccpia]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In plants, individual flowers are called dichogamous if their function has the two sexes separated in time, although the plant as a whole may have functionally male and functionally female flowers open at any one moment. A flower is protogynous if its function is first female, then male, and protandrous if its function is male then female. It used to be thought that this reduced [[inbreeding]], but it may be a more general mechanism for reducing pollen-pistil interference.

===Protandry===
[[File:Anemone purple anemonefish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ocellaris clownfish]], ''Amphiprion ocellaris'', a protandrous animal species]]

Protandrous hermaphrodites are animals that are born male and at some point in their lifespan change sex to female. Protandrous animals include [[Amphiprioninae|clownfish]]. Clownfish have a very structured society. In the ''[[Amphiprioninae#Taxonomy|Amphiprion]] percula'' species, there are zero to four individuals excluded from breeding and a breeding pair living in a [[sea anemone]]. [[Dominance hierarchy|Dominance]] is based on size, the female being the largest and the male being the second largest. The rest of the group is made up of progressively smaller non-breeders, which have no functioning gonads.&lt;ref name='Buston p'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Territory inheritance in clownfish | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2004 | first=P. M | last=Buston | volume=271 | pages=s252-s254| id=| pmc=1810038 | pmid=15252999 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0156}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the female dies, the male gains weight and becomes the female for that group. The largest non-breeding fish then sexually matures and becomes the male of the group.&lt;ref name='Buston'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Does the Presence of Non-Breeders Enhance the Fitness of Breeders ?

Other protandrous fishes can be found in the classes [[clupeiformes]], [[siluriformes]], [[stomiiformes]], and within the perciform families [[pomacentridae]] and [[sparidae]]. Since these groups are distantly related and have many intermediate relatives that are not protandrous, it strongly suggests that protandry evolved multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avise|first1=J. C.|last2=Mank|first2=J. E.|title=Evolutionary Perspectives on Hermaphroditism in Fishes|journal=Sexual Development|date=2009|volume=3|issue=2–3|pages=152–163|doi=10.1159/000223079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of protandrous animals include:
* The [[ctenophore]] ''[[Coeloplana]] gonoctena''. In this organism the females are bigger than the males and are only found during the summer. In contrast males are found year-round.
* The flatworms ''[[Hymanella]] retenuova'' and ''[[Paravortex]] cardii''.
* ''[[Laevapex fuscus]]'', a [[gastropod]], is described as being functionally protandric. The [[sperm]] matures in late winter and early spring, the eggs mature in early summer, and [[copulation]] occurs only in June. This shows that males cannot reproduce until the females appear, thus why they are considered to be functionally protandric.&lt;ref name='Policansky'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sex change in plants and animals | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | year=1982 | first=D. | last=Policansky | volume=13 | pages=471–495 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.002351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Russell-Hunter, W.

===Protogyny===
[[File:Thalassoma lunare 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moon wrasse]], ''Thalassoma lunare'', a protogynous animal species]]

Protogynous hermaphrodites are animals that are born female and at some point in their lifespan change sex to male. As the animal ages, based on internal or external triggers, it shifts sex to become a male animal. Male [[fecundity]] increases greatly with age, unlike female.

Protogyny is the most common form of hermaphroditism in fish in nature.&lt;ref name='Avise'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evolutionary Perspectives on Hermaphroditism in Fishes | journal=Sexual Development | year=2009 | first=JC | last=Avise |author2=JE Mank  | volume=3 | pages=152–163| id=| doi=10.1159/000223079}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 75% of the 500 known sequentially hermaphroditic fish species are protogynous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pauly|first1=Daniel|title=Darwin's Fishes: An Encyclopedia of Ichthyology, Ecology, and Evolution|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139451819|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandian|first=TJ|title=Genetic Sex Differentiation in Fish|year=2012|publisher=Science Publishers|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common model organisms for this type of sequential hermaphroditism are [[wrasses]]. They are one of the largest families of coral reef fish and belong to the family Labridae. Wrasses are found around the world in all marine habitats and tend to bury themselves in sand at night or when they feel threatened.&lt;ref name='Animal Planet'&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animal.discovery.com/guides/fish/marine/wrasseintro.html | title=Animal Planet :: Fish Guide -- Wrasse | accessdate=2011-03-28 | publisher=PetEducation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wrasses, the larger of the two fish is the male, while the smaller is the female. In most cases, females and immature have a uniform color while the male has the terminal bicolored phase.&lt;ref name='Warner R'/&gt; Large males hold territories and try to pair spawn while small to mid-size initial-phase males live with females and group [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].&lt;ref name='Adreani'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mating system and reproductive biology of a temperate wrasse, ''Halichoeres semicinctus'' | journal=Copeia | year=2008 | first=M. S. | last=Adreani |author2=Allen, L. G. | pages=467–475 | doi=10.1643/cp-06-265 | volume=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, both the initial and terminal phase males can breed; however, they differ in the way they do it.

In the [[California sheephead]] (''Semicossyphus pulcher''), a type of wrasse, when the female changes to male, the ovaries degenerate and spermatogenic crypts appear in the gonads. The general structure of the gonads remains ovarian after the transformation and the sperm is transported through a series of ducts on the periphery of the gonad and [[oviduct]]. Here sex change is age-dependent. For example, the California sheephead stays a female for four years before changing sex.&lt;ref name='Warner R'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The reproductive biology of the Protogynous hermaphrodite Pimelometopon Pulchrum (Pisces: Labridae). | journal=Fishery Bulletin | year=1975 | first=R.R | last=Warner | volume=73 | pages=261–283| id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thalassoma bifasciatum|Blue-headed wrasse]] begin life as males or females, but females can change sex and function as males. Young females and males start with a distinct coloration known as the "Initial Phase" before progressing into the "Terminal Phase" coloration, which has a change in intensity of color, stripes, and bars. Initial Phase males have larger [[testes]] than larger, terminal phase males, which enables the initial phase males to produce a large amount of sperm. This strategy is able to compete with that of the larger male, who is able to guard his own harem.

''[[Botryllus schlosseri]]'', a colonial [[tunicate]], is a protogynous hermaphrodite. In a colony, eggs are released about two days before the peak of sperm emission.&lt;ref name="pmid25044771"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gasparini F |author2=Manni L. |author3=Cima F. |author4=Zaniolo G |author5=Burighel P |author6=Caicci F |author7=Franchi N |author8=Schiavon F |author9=Rigon F |author10=Campagna D |author11=Ballarin L |title=Sexual and asexual reproduction in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri |journal=Genesis |volume= 53|issue= |pages= 105–20| date=July  2014 |pmid=25044771 |doi=10.1002/dvg.22802 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although self-fertilization is avoided and cross-fertilization favored by this strategy, self-fertilization is still possible. Self-fertilized eggs develop with a substantially higher frequency of anomalies during cleavage than cross-fertilized eggs (23% vs. 1.6%).&lt;ref name="pmid25044771" /&gt;  Also a significantly lower percentage of larvae derived from self-fertilized eggs metamorphose, and the growth of the colonies derived from their metamorphosis is significantly lower.  These findings suggest that self-fertilization gives rise to inbreeding depression associated with developmental deficits that are likely caused by expression of deleterious recessive mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bernstein | first1=H. | last2=Hopf | first2=F.

{{anchor|Size-advantage model}}

===Ultimate causes===

The [[proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate cause]] of a biological phenomenon concerns why that phenomenon makes organisms better adapted to their environment, and thus why evolution by natural selection has produced that phenomenon. This is in contrast to proximate causes, which concern the molecular and physiological mechanisms that produce the phenomenon. A number of ultimate causes of hermaphroditism have been proposed, of which two are most relevant to sequential hermaphroditism.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The evolution of hermaphroditism among animals | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=1969 | first=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin | last=Ghiselin | volume=44 | pages=189–208| id=| pmid=4901396 | issue=2 | doi=10.1086/406066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'size-advantage model' states that individuals of a given sex reproduce more effectively if they are a certain size or age. To create selection for sequential hermaphroditism, small individuals must have higher reproductive fitness as one sex and larger individuals must have higher reproductive fitness as the opposite sex. For example, eggs are larger than sperm, thus larger individuals are able to make more eggs, so individuals could maximize their reproductive potential by beginning life as male and then turning female upon achieving a certain size.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequential hermaphroditism can also protect against inbreeding in populations of organisms that have low enough motility and/or are sparsely distributed enough that there is a considerable risk of siblings encountering each other after reaching sexual maturity, and interbreeding. If siblings are all the same or similar ages, and if they all begin life as one sex and then transition to the other sex at about the same age, then siblings are highly likely to be the same sex at any given time. This should dramatically reduce the likelihood of inbreeding. Both protandry and protogyny are known to help prevent inbreeding in plants,{{cn|date=October 2018}} and many examples of sequential hermaphroditism attributable to inbreeding prevention have been identified in a wide variety of animals.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[ectotherms]] body size and female fecundity are positively correlated.&lt;ref name='Warner'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Adaptive Significance of Sequential Hermaphroditism in Animals. | journal=The American Naturalist | year=1975 | first=R. R. | last=Warner | volume=109 | pages=61–82| id=| doi=10.1086/282974}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the size-advantage model. Kazancioglu and Alonzo (2010) performed the first comparative analysis of sex change in [[Labridae]]. Their analysis supports the size-advantage model and suggest that sequential hermaphroditism is correlated to the size-advantage. They determined that [[dioecy]] was less likely to occur when the size advantage is stronger than other advantages&lt;ref name='Alonzo'&gt;{{cite journal | title=A comparative analysis of sex change in Labridae supports the size advantage hypothesis | journal=Evolution; international journal of organic evolution | year=2010 | first=E | last=Kazancioğlu |author2=SH Alonzo  | volume=64 | pages=2254–64| id=| pmid=20394662 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01016.x | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warner suggests that selection for protandry may occur in populations where female fecundity is augmented with age and individuals mate randomly. Selection for protogyny may occur where there are traits in the population that depress male fecundity at early ages (territoriality, mate selection or inexperience) and when female fecundity is decreased with age, the latter seems to be rare in the field.&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt; An example of territoriality favoring protogyny occurs when there is a need to protect their habitat and being a large male is advantageous for this purpose. In the mating aspect, a large male has a higher chance of mating, while this has no effect on the female mating fitness.&lt;ref name='Alonzo'/&gt; Thus, he suggests that female fecundity has more impact on sequential hermaphroditism than the age structures of the population.&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt;

The size-advantage model predicts that sex change would only be absent if the relationship between size/age with reproductive potential is identical in both sexes. With this prediction one would assume that hermaphroditism is very common, but this is not the case. Sequential hermaphroditism is very rare and according to scientists this is due to some cost that decreases fitness in sex changers as opposed to those who don’t change sex. Some of the hypotheses proposed for the dearth of hermaphrodites are the energetic cost of sex change, genetic and/or physiological barriers to sex change, and sex-specific mortality rates.&lt;ref name='Warner' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Charnov'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Size Advantage May Not Always Favor Sex Change | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=1986 | first=E | last=Charnov | volume=119 | pages=283–285| id=| pmid= | doi= 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80141-2| issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Munday'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The energetic cost of protogynous versus protandrous sex change in the bi-directional sex changing fish Gobiodon histrio | journal=Marine Biology | year=2002 | first=P | last=Munday|author2=BW Molony  | volume=141 | pages=429–446| id=| pmid= | doi= 10.1007/s00227-002-0904-8| issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Kazanciglu and Alonzo found that dioecy was only favored when the cost of changing sex was very large. This indicates that the cost of sex change does not explain the rarity of sequential hermaphroditism by itself.&lt;ref name='Kazancioğlu'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Costs of changing sex do not explain why sequential hermaphroditism is rare | journal=The American Naturalist | year=2009 | first=E | last=Kazancioğlu |author2=SH Alonzo  | volume=173 | pages=327–36| id=| pmid=19199519 | doi=10.1086/596539 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximate causes===

Many studies have focused on the proximate causes of sequential hermaphroditism. The role of [[aromatase]] has been widely studied in this area. Aromatase is an [[enzyme]] that controls the [[androgen]]/[[estrogen]] ratio in animals by catalyzing the conversion of [[testosterone]] into [[oestradiol]], which is irreversible. It has been discovered that the aromatase pathway mediates sex change in both directions.&lt;ref name='Kroon'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aromatase pathway mediates sex change in each direction. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2005 | first=F.

One such study was performed by Kobayashi et al. In their study they tested the role of estrogens in male three-spot wrasses (''Halichoeres trimaculatus''). They discovered that fish treated with aromatase inhibitors showed decreased gonodal weight, plasma estrogen level and spermatogonial proliferation in the testis as well as increased androgen levels. Their results suggest that estrogens are important in the regulation of [[spermatogenesis]] in this protogynous hermaphrodite.&lt;ref name='Kobayashi'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Role of estrogen in spermatogenesis in initial phase males of the three-spot wrasse (''Halichoeres trimaculatus''): wffect of aromatase inhibitor on the testis. | journal=Developmental Dynamics | year=2011 | first=y | last=Kobayashi |author2=Nozu R |author3=Nakamura M.  | volume=240 | pages=116–121| id=| url=https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78650344417&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=847189402b2dcdb18259e2dc89206111 | accessdate=2011-04-27 | doi=10.1002/dvdy.22507 | pmid=21117145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic consequences===

Sequential hermaphrodites almost always have a sex ratio biased towards the birth sex, and consequently experience significantly more reproductive success after switching sexes. In theory, this should decrease [[genetic diversity]] and [[effective population size]] (Ne). However, a study of two ecologically similar [[Cheimerius|santer sea bream]] ([[gonochoric]]) and [[Chrysoblephus puniceus|slinger sea bream]] (protogynous) in South African waters found that genetic diversities were similar in the two species, and while Ne was lower in the instant for the sex-changer, they were similar over a relatively short time horizion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coscia |first1=I. |last2=Chopelet|first2=J. |last3=Waples|first3=R.

=== Flowering plants ===
[[File:Aeonium protandry.jpg|thumb|Protandrous flowers of ''[[Aeonium undulatum]]'']]
In the context of the [[plant sexuality]] of flowering plants (angiosperms), there are two forms of dichogamy: '''''protogyny'''''&amp;mdash;female function precedes male function&amp;mdash;and '''''protandry'''''&amp;mdash;male function precedes female function.

Historically, dichogamy has been regarded as a mechanism for reducing [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref name=Darwin1862&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |title=On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilized by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing |publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1862 |url=http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin3/orchids/orchids_fm.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215011429/http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin3/orchids/orchids_fm.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey of the angiosperms found that [[self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]] (SI) plants, which are incapable of inbreeding, were as likely to be dichogamous as were self-compatible (SC) plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2445372 |author=Bertin, R.I. |title=Incidence of monoecy and dichogamy in relation to self-fertilization in angiosperms |journal=Am. J. Bot. |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=557–60 |year=1993 |jstor=2445372}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding led to a reinterpretation of dichogamy as a more general mechanism for reducing the impact of [[pollen]]-[[Carpel|pistil]] interference on pollen import and export.&lt;ref name=LloydWebb1986&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lloyd, D. G., Webb, C. J. |title=The avoidance of interference between the presentation of pollen and  stigmas in angiosperms: I. Dichogamy |journal=New Zeal. J.

Unlike the [[inbreeding avoidance]] hypothesis, which focused on female function, this interference-avoidance hypothesis considers both reproductive functions.

In many hermaphroditic species, the close physical proximity of [[anthers]] and  [[Carpel|stigma]] makes interference unavoidable, either within a  [[flower]] or between  flowers on an  [[inflorescence]]. Within-flower interference, which occurs when either the  pistil interrupts pollen removal or the  anthers prevent pollen deposition, can result in autonomous or facilitated self-pollination.&lt;ref name=LloydSchoen1992&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/297040 |author=Lloyd, D.

This results in [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous]] pollination, the transfer of pollen between flowers of the same individual.&lt;ref name=deJong1993&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(93)90239-L |author=de Jong, T.

Therefore, between-flower interference not only carries the cost of self-fertilization ([[inbreeding depression]]&lt;ref name=Schemske1980&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2408218 |author=Schemske, D.W. |title=Evolution of floral display in the orchid ''Brassavola nodosa'' |journal=Evolution |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=489–91 |year=1980 |jstor=2408218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.18.110187.001321 |author=Charlesworth, D.; Charlesworth, B. |title=Inbreeding Depression and its Evolutionary Consequences |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=18 |pages=237–68 |year=1987 |jstor=2097132}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but also reduces the amount of pollen available for export (so-called "pollen discounting"&lt;ref name="Harder, L.

Because pollen discounting diminishes outcross siring success, interference avoidance may be an important evolutionary force in floral biology.&lt;ref name="Harder, L. D.; Wilson, W.

Protandry may be particularly relevant to this compromise, because it often results in an  inflorescence structure with female phase flowers positioned below male phase flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02856676 |author1=Bertin, R.

These effects of protandry on between-flower interference may decouple the benefits of large inflorescences from the consequences of geitonogamy and pollen discounting. Such a decoupling would provide a significant reproductive advantage through increased pollinator visitation and siring success.

Harder et al. (2000) demonstrated experimentally that dichogamy both reduced rates of self-fertilization and enhanced outcross siring success through reductions in geitonogamy and pollen discounting, respectively.&lt;ref name=Harderetal2000/&gt; Routley &amp; Husband (2003) examined the influence of inflorescence size on this siring advantage and found a bimodal distribution with increased siring success with both small and large display sizes.&lt;ref name=RoutleyHusband2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Routley, M.

The length of stigmatic receptivity plays a key role in regulating the isolation of the male and female stages in dichogamous plants, and stigmatic receptivity can be influenced by both temperature and humidity.&lt;ref name=Lora&gt;{{cite journal | title=Stigmatic receptivity in a dichogamous early-divergent angiosperm species, ''Annona cherimola'' (Annonaceae): Influence of temperature and humidity. | journal=American Journal of Botany | year=2011 | first=J. | last=Lora |author2=Herrero, M. |author3=Hormaza, J.

==Family and personal life==
Aamer was born on 21 December 1966 and grew up in [[Medina]] in Saudi Arabia. He left the country at the age of 17. He lived and traveled in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=independent1/&gt; Aamer lived and studied in Georgia and Maryland in 1989 and 1990. During the [[Gulf War]], he worked as a translator for the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/11-years-in-guantanamo-without-trial-or-charges/|title = 11 years in Guantanamo without trial or charges|author = Phil Hirschkorn|date = March 31, 2013|access-date = November 1, 2015|publisher = [[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to the United Kingdom in 1996 where he met Zin Siddique, a British woman; they married in 1997 and he established legal [[residency (domicile)|residency]] in Britain. They have four British children, the youngest of whom Aamer had never met, due to his having been born after Aamer's imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Bbc050208&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4245517.stm "Calls to free Guantanamo father"], [[BBC]], 8 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Aamer had indefinite leave to remain in the UK, and was applying for British citizenship.&lt;ref name=grauniad/&gt;

Aamer worked as an Arabic translator for [[London]] law firms. Some of the solicitors he worked for dealt with [[immigration]] cases. In his spare time, Aamer helped refugees find accommodation and offered them advice on their struggles with the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/shaker-aamer-guantanamos-last-british-detainee-1914791.html|title=Shaker Aamer: Guantanamo's last British detainee|work=The Independent|date=3 March 2010|accessdate=5 January 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Aamer's family lived in [[Battersea]], South London. His wife Zin Aamer suffered from [[Mood disorder|depression]] and mental episodes since his arrest.&lt;ref name="independent2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent5Jan2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wandsworthnews/9446170.Ten_years_in_custody_without_charge_for_Shaker_Aamer/|title=Ten years in custody without charge for Battersea's Shaker Aamer|work=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed Siddique, Aamer's father-in-law, said in 2011, "When he was captured, Shaker offered to let my daughter divorce him, but she said, 'No, I will wait for you.'

==Capture and allegations==
[[File:Abdul Shaker with Children.jpg|240px|right|thumb|

Aamer took his family to Afghanistan in 2001, where he was working for an Islamic charity when the U.S. invaded the country later that year.&lt;ref name="Bbc050208"/&gt; The [[Northern Alliance]] took him into custody in [[Jalalabad]] in December 2001, and passed him to the Americans. The US routinely paid ransom for Arabs handed over to them.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; They interrogated Aamer at [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]] and transported him to Guantánamo on 14 February 2002.

According to [[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] assessments from 1 November 2007, the US military believed that Aamer was a "recruiter, financier, and facilitator" for [[al-Qaeda]], based partly on spurious evidence given by the informant [[Yasim Muhammed Basardah]], a fellow detainee.&lt;ref name=20110503cahalan/&gt; The leaked documents alleged that Aamer had confessed to interrogators that he was in [[Tora Bora]] with Osama bin Laden at the time of the US bombing.&lt;ref name="eluded-US-during-10-year-manhunt"/&gt; The documents further note that the Saudi intelligence [[Mabahith]] identified Aamer "as a high priority for the government of Saudi Arabia, an indication of his law enforcement value to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leigh|first1=David|last2=Cobain|first2=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-shaker-aamer-british|title=Guantánamo Bay files: Shaker Aamer, inmate from Britain the US won't let go|date=24 April 2011|work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Guantanamo Review Task Force]] released their report of the detainee assessments. In many instances, the Task Force largely agreed with prior [[threat assessment]]s of the detainees and sometimes found additional information that further substantiated such assessments. In other instances, the Task Force found prior assessments to be overstated. Some assessments, for example, contained allegations that were not supported by the underlying source document upon which they relied. Other assessments contained conclusions that were stated categorically even though derived from uncorroborated statements or raw intelligence reporting of undetermined or questionable reliability. Conversely, in a few cases, the Task Force discovered reliable information indicating that a detainee posed a greater threat in some respects than prior assessments suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/ag/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf#page=13 Guantanamo Review Task Force Final Report], (p.&amp;nbsp;9)&lt;/ref&gt;

He pointed out that part of the evidence comes from [[Yasim Muhammed Basardah]], whom American judges found to be "utterly incredible" and who was tortured and "promised all sorts of things."&lt;ref name=20110503cahalan/&gt;

The Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer, and he was cleared for transfer in 2007.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheScotsman9Jan2012/&gt;  The clearance was for transfer to Saudi Arabia only.&lt;ref name="GuardianTownsend20130420"/&gt;

==Aamer's allegations of being tortured in Bagram ==
In September 2009, [[Zachary Philip Katznelson|Zachary Katznelson]], a Reprieve lawyer, said that Aamer had told of suffering severe beatings at the Bagram facility. Aamer said that close to a dozen men had beaten him, including interrogators who represented themselves as officers of [[MI5]], the United Kingdom's internal counter-terrorism agency. Following one severe beating, he recovered from being stunned to find that all the interrogators had left the room and put a pistol on the table.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06/&gt; He did not determine if the pistol was loaded. He said it occurred to him that it had been left either so he could kill himself, or that, if he picked it up, he could be shot and killed on the excuse he was trying to shoot them.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06/&gt;

Aamer says that the "MI5" interrogators told him he had two choices: (1) agree to spy on suspected jihadists in the United Kingdom; or (2) remain in US custody.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/06/guantanamo-gun-abuse-cia-mi5|title='MI5 agent left me alone with gun', says Guantánamo terror detainee|date=6 September 2009|author=Doward, Jamie|work=The Guardian|location=London|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fworld%2F2009%2Fsep%2F06%2Fguantanamo-gun-abuse-cia-mi5&amp;date=2009-09-06|archivedate=6 September 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that guards/agents repeatedly knocked his head against the wall while an MI5 officer was in the room.

==Guantanamo==
Aamer has been described as an unofficial [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the detainees at Guantanamo. He has spoken up for the welfare of prisoners, negotiating with camp commanders and organizing protests against cruel treatment. He organized and participated in a [[Guantánamo Bay hunger strikes|hunger strike in 2005]] in which he lost half of his weight. He demanded the prisoners be treated according to the [[Geneva Convention]], allowing the detainees to form a grievance committee. In negotiations, the camp administration promised a healthier diet for the prisoners after he agreed to end the hunger strike.&lt;ref name=independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent20070914/&gt; His lawyer Stafford Smith said the grievance committee was formed, but that the camp authorities disbanded it after a few days. American spokesmen Major Jeffrey Weir denied that the Americans had ever agreed to any conditions resulting from the hunger strike.

In September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison. They argued extended periods of isolation were detrimental to his mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=Spectacle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectacle.co.uk/projects_page.php?id=486|title=Updates - Shaker Aamer|work=Spectacle|location=UK|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamer continued to take part in additional hunger strikes and was held in solitary confinement for most of the time. His lawyers described his solitary confinement as "cruel" and said his health was affected to a point where they feared for his life. In 2011 Stafford Smith, director of the UK branch of Reprieve, said Aamer is "falling apart at the seams."&lt;ref name="morningstaronline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependentJan2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Carol |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/12/24/2560773/secret-guantanamo-cell-block-cost.html |title=Secret Guantánamo cell block cost nearly $700,000 – Guantánamo |work=Miami Herald |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison.&lt;ref name=Cnn060918&gt;

The next day Katznelson filed a motion to enforce the Geneva Conventions on his behalf.&lt;ref name=Habeas04cv2215-2006-09-19&gt;

After President [[Barack Obama]] was elected, in 2009 he convened a six-agency task force to review the status of detainees at Guantanamo. It "unanimously recommended" transfer of Aamer.&lt;ref name="nytOct15"/&gt; Security officials wanted to send him to Saudi Arabia, his country of citizenship, but his attorneys argued for him to be transferred to Great Britain, where he had been resident and had family.&lt;ref name="nytOct15"&gt;Charles Savage and Steven Erlanger, "Guantánamo Release Ends Yearslong Battle", ''New York Times'', 31 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Aamer's lawyer Brent Mickum, who saw him in Guantánamo, alleges that Aamer was repeatedly beaten before their meetings. He said that Aamer's mental and physical health is deteriorating. "It felt like he has given up: that's what 10 years, mostly in solitary confinement will do to a person," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/last-briton-in-guantanamo-on-hunger-strike |title=Last Briton in Guantanamo on hunger strike |publisher=Channel 4 News |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Binyam Mohamed]], an Ethiopian prisoner who formerly occupied a cell one door down from Aamer, has said since his release that he knows why Aamer is still in the prison camps.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say the Americans are trying to keep him as silent as they could. It's not that he has anything. What happened in 2005 and 2006 is something that the Americans don't want the world to know – hunger strikes, and all the events that took place, until the three brothers who died ... insider information of all the events, probably. Obviously, Shaker doesn't have it, but the Americans think he may have some of it, and they don't like this kind of information being released.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clive Stafford Smith, his lawyer and director of human rights organisation Reprieve, came to a similar conclusion. He said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wandsworthnews/5001740._Heartbreaking__moment_Shaker_Aamer_saw_first_photo_of_son/ |title='Heartbreaking' moment Shaker Aamer saw first photo of son |work=Your Local Guardian |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have known Shaker for some time, because he is so eloquent and outspoken about the injustices of Guantanamo he is very definitely viewed as a threat by the US. Not in the sense of being an extremist but in the sense of being someone who can rather eloquently criticise the nightmare that happened there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Omar Deghayes]], a former Guantanamo Detainee who knew Aamer, said of him,

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was always forward, he would translate for people, he'd fight for them, and if he had any problems in the block he'd shout at the guards... until he would get you your rights. And that's why he's still in prison... because he's very outspoken, a very intelligent person, somebody who would fight for somebody else's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.co.uk/projects_page.php?id=485 |title='Spectacle Shaker Aamer |work= Spectacle |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===At Camp "No" on June 2006===
{{main|Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations}}
In an article published in 2010, Aamer said that he was beaten for hours and subjected to interrogation methods that included [[asphyxiation]] on 9 June 2006, the same day that [[Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations|three fellow prisoners died in Guantanamo]]. The United States claimed these deaths were suicides.&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;

Describing his treatment, Aamer said that he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. When MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body: his temples, just under his jawline, in the hollow beneath his ears. They bent his nose repeatedly, pinched his thighs and feet. They inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he screamed and then they cut off his airway and put a mask over him, so he could not cry out.&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18&gt;

The law professor [[Scott Horton (attorney)|Scott Horton]] published an award-winning article on the 2006 deaths in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in 2010, suggesting that these were cases of homicide caused by extended torture, rather than suicide. He said that Aamer had been brought to "[[Camp No, Guantanamo|Camp No]]," a secret interrogation [[black site]] outside the camp, with the three men who died on the day of the event. Horton described Aamer's account of having his airways cut off as "alarming" and wrote, "This is the same technique that appears to have been used on the three deceased prisoners."&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-01-18/&gt; Colonel [[Michael Bumgarner]], the commander of the camps during the incident and identified in Horton's article as having been present during the interrogations, denied Horton's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2010/01/hbc-90006395 |title=The Official Response Begins| author=Horton, Scott |work=Harpers Magazine |date=18 May 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horton wrote that Aamer's repatriation was being delayed so that he could not testify about his alleged torture in [[Bagram]] or the events on 9 June 2006. He wrote: "American authorities may be concerned that Aamer, if released, could provide evidence against them in criminal investigations."&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-01-18/&gt;

=== 2013 hunger strike and detention condition ===

In 2013, Aamer told his attorneys that he was among the growing group of active hunger strikers. He said he had been refusing meals since February 15 and had lost 32 pounds.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; In previous hunger strikes guards [[force-fed]] him with tubes down his nose.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; His lawyer said Aamer spent 22 hours a day alone in his cell.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Aamer was not permitted visitors except his attorneys.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Aamer was among a group of detainees who filed a court challenge to the authorities' practice of force feeding those on hunger strikes. A United States appellate court ruled in 2014 "that the judiciary could oversee conditions of confinement at the prison."&lt;ref name="nytOct15"/&gt;

=== 2014 motion for release ===
In 2014, his lawyers filed a motion on Aamer's behalf seeking his release on the grounds that his health is "gravely diminished,". They argued that his various health problems could not be treated in Guantanamo and "''even if he receives the intensive medical and therapeutic treatment his condition requires, Mr Aamer will take many years, if not a lifetime, to achieve any significant recovery". His lawyers argued that both the [[Geneva Convention]] and Army Regulation 190-8, require the repatriation of chronically ill prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26933512|title=Bid to free last British resident held at Guantanamo|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/guantanamo-bay-british-detainee-shaker-aamer-ptsd-release|title=Guantánamo Bay: last British resident suffering from PTSD, lawyers say|author=Jon Swaine|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/04/last-former-english-resident-in-guantanamo-bay-requests-release-on-declining-health.php|title=JURIST - Guantanamo detainee requests release on declining health|work=jurist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 despite Aamer's deteriorating health, the US denied attorneys' request for an independent medical examination.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

==UK release negotiations==
The United Kingdom government initially refused to intervene on the behalf of Guantánamo detainees who were legal British residents but were not British [[Citizenship|citizens]].  In August 2007, Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] requested the release of Aamer and four other men, based on their having been granted refugee status, or similar leave, to remain in Britain as residents prior to their capture by US forces.&lt;ref name="Bbc050208"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent20070914&gt;

On 30 October 2015, Aamer was flown from Cuba, stepping on British soil at 13.00 GMT. In a later interview he discussed his detention and family life. He also called upon jihadis to "get the hell out" of Britain, stating that civilian killings were "not allowed" in Islam, and went on to say that "you cannot just go in the street and get a knife and start stabbing people" in apparent reference to the [[murder of Lee Rigby]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/shaker-aamer-attacks-extremism-guantanamo-release

'''''Shijie''''', which has numerous translations such as '''liberation from the corpse''' and '''release by means of a corpse''', is an esoteric [[Daoist]] technique for an adept to transform into a ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' ("transcendent; immortal"), typically using some bureaucratic ruse to evade the [[Underworld|netherworld]] administrative system of life and death registration. The many varieties of ''shijie'' range from deceitful cases, such as a person [[feign death|feigning death]] by substituting the corpse of their recently deceased grandfather as their own, to supernatural cases, such as (''jianjie'' 劍解, "sword liberation") using a ''[[waidan]]'' alchemical sword to temporarily create a corpse-[[simulacrum]], which enables one to escape and assume a new identity.

==Terminology==
===Shijie===
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term ''shījiě'' [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] the words ''shī'' (尸 or 屍, "corpse; body") and ''jiě'' (解, "separate; divide; cut apart"), and has been described as a "rather strange name" (Seidel 1987: 230), "notoriously slippery term" (Benn 2003: 139), with "the potential for confusion" (Campany 2002: 53), and sometimes "misrepresented or interpreted in a way too vague to be intelligible" (Pas 1998: 57).

'''''Shī''''' (尸) has three sets of English translation equivalents in Paul W. Kroll's dictionary of [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Medieval Chinese]]:
#person serving as a surrogate for the deceased in a sacrificial ceremony, the impersonator … [[Spirit tablet|memorial tablet]]
#corpse, [[lich]]; cadaver … lay out a corpse; expose a corpse
#be in charge of, have the care or supervision of … occupy a position without performing the duties attached to it (2017: 410-411)
''Shi'''s first equivalent of the ceremonial [[Shi (personator)|personator]] who was a stand-in for a deceased relative ("corpse") during Chinese [[Chinese funeral rituals|funeral rituals]] and [[Ancestor Veneration in China|ancestral rites]] is a semantic extension of the basic meaning "corpse" (Carr 2007). Campany describes the ''shi'' "impersonator of deceased ancestors, one who sat in their place during the solemn presentation of food, drink, and announcements and the performance of dances" (2002: 53).

Besides the usual meaning of "corpse, dead body", ''shi'' 尸 can sometimes mean "body, mortal body"—particularly in ''shijie'' contexts. Joseph Needham translates ''shijie'' as "release from the mortal part" (1974: 297), which is more appropriate than "release from the corpse" because the first step in achieving ''shijie'' transcendence is to abandon one's corporeal body (Pregadio 2004: 117). Anna Seidel points out that ''shi'' in the term ''shijie'' denotes "all the corruptible aging factors of the physical body," rather than the corpse itself (1987: 230). Fabrizio Pregadio cites a classic Daoist text that clearly uses the word ''shi'' to denote "not specifically a corpse, but in general the 'mortal body', either living or dead". A passage in the c. 200 CE ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the ''[[Daodejing]]'' (see below) contrasts ''shisi'' (尸死) and ''shisheng'' (尸生), which cannot be read literally to mean "a corpse dies" and "a corpse lives". "When the mortal body dies (''shisi''), that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives (''shisheng''), that is accomplishment"; this context refers to options for a living person, and not to a postmortem renewal; "its subject, in other words, is not the 'corpse' but the 'mortal body'" (2004: 116-117). However, Campany contends that what is escaped through ''shijie'' is not the adept's ''shi'' dead body but the administrative system of death registration (2002: 53).

Owing to the ambiguities of reading the original [[Chinese character]] 尸 for ''shi'' "corpse; mortal body; personator of the dead; etc.", the basic meaning of "corpse" is clarified with the character ''shi'' 屍 that adds ''si'' (死, "die; death") to ''shi'' 尸. Compare the word ''sǐshī'' (死屍, lit. "dead corpse") meaning "corpse; dead body".

'''''Jie''''' (解) has seven sets of English translation equivalents in Kroll's dictionary:
#untie, unknot, loosen, release … doff, take off
#disjoint, dismember … dissect; analyze, take apart
# remove, eliminate … resolve; (find a) solution, work out (a problem)
# deliver from, release, liberate, free oneself from; emancipate
# dissipate, dissolve; disperse; dispel
# open out; unfurl, unfold; reveal
# explain, expound; exposition … (2017: 210)
Kroll gives ''shijie'' as a usage example under both ''shi'' 2. and ''jie'' 4., glossed as "'deliverance by means of a [simulated] corpse,' in which the adept's supposed corpse is buried but is actually substituted with a personal object (sword, staff, etc.) that temporarily takes on the appearance of the corpse, thus allowing one to escape from the bureaucracy of death; a lower-level means of transcendence." 

Scholars propose divergent semantic interpretations of the ''jie'' in ''shijie'': "to molt," "to quarter," "to expel an affliction" (Robinet 1979: 58); "to divide, separate, disperse, to detach, deliver", "to loosen, dissolve, explain", and "emancipation, liberation" in Chinese Buddhism (Pas 1998: 58); and "release, deliverance, escape" (Campany 2002: 53). The ancient ''shijie'' is related with the medical term ''shītǐ jiěpu'' (屍體解剖, "autopsy; postmortem examination") that combines ''shītǐ'' (屍體, "corpse; remains") with ''jiěpōu'' (解剖, "dissect").

===Varieties===
The forms of ''shijie'' are quite diverse, in its broadest meaning, the term sometimes simply denotes disappearance, "to depart on a journey through foreign lands." It more commonly designates a type of disappearance that leaves a trace behind, such as a body without its bones, or a coffin that contains only a symbolic staff, sword, or sandal. Sometimes ''shijie'' can even refer to an adept who comes back to life after [[apparent death]] (Robinet 1979: 58-59).

The French sinologist Isabelle Robinet compares the common forms of ''shijie''.
*''Jianjie'' (劍解, "deliverance by a sword") is considered the most noble ''shijie'' method. This technique requires either an inferior "simple sword" or a divine "magical sword" that enables one "to return to your old village under another name" since the subterranean officials no longer have any hold on those who have performed it. 
*''Bingjie'' (兵解, "deliverance by a military weapon" or "escape by execution") is the liberation of those who have been executed, such as the famous [[Zuo Ci]] (155-220) who continued to be seen alive in [[Jingzhou]] despite the fact that [[Cao Cao]] was in possession of his head and the rest of his body had disappeared. 
*''Wenjie'' (文解, "peaceful deliverance"), which contrasts with ''bingjie'', involves replacing the body with sandals or a staff. [[Maxime Kaltenmark]] showed that Daoist magical sandals are birds, which enable the adept to soar aloft and fly away, similar with ''jianjie''.
*''Shuijie'' (水解, "deliverance by water") is when the body of a drowned person is protected by a compassionate divinity, "On the outside it is said that he drowned; on the inside, in truth, he is secretly saved."
*''Huojie'' (火解, "deliverance by fire") involves a Daoist who is burned alive and apparently flies away in the form of a bird. In certain cases, the adept's body undergoes [[spontaneous human combustion]], such as Cai Jing (蔡經), whose body burned for three days until his bones dissolved and "only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell" (1979: 60-62).
Another variation is ''zhangjie'' (杖解, "staff-liberated)", when the adept's bamboo staff served as a temporary stand-in for his real body, which was transformed and vanished away to the realm of the immortals (Strickmann 1979: 130).

===Related terms===
''Shijie'' is similar to the word ''[[bianhua]]'' ("transformation; metamorphosis") and its synonymous components ''bian'' (變, "change; alter") and ''hua'' (化, "change; transform"). For instance, the 499 ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' refers to a superior method of ''shijie'' called ''huadun'' (化遁, "to transform and escape"), and mentions ''tuohua dunbian'' (託化遁變, "to simulate transformation and hide by metamorphosis"); and the 983 ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' describes ''shijie dunbian'' (尸解遁變, "delivered from the body and transformed by escaping") (Robinet 1979: 57). All types of ''bianhua'' require a material support, and ''shijie'' generally involves "going away by making use of a material object." However, there is an essential difference between them. ''Bianhua'' is a magical trick or the manipulation of a power that the mystic can use while alive; ''Shijie'' is only practiced at the end of life and is a form of deliverance linked with the purification and refinement of the body (Robinet 1993: 168).

[[File:Album of 18 Daoist Paintings - 10.jpg|thumb|[[He Xiangu]] flying on a crane; painting by [[Zhang Lu (painter)|Zhang Lu]] (1464–1538)]]
The ''huà'' (化, "change; transform; convert") in ''bianhua'' occurs in several Daoist alternative terms for ''shijie''. ''Jiěhuà'' (解化, with the ''jie'' "release; etc." in ''shijie'') means "liberate the mortal body and attain the Dao". ''Xiāohuà'' (銷化, with "melt away; disintegrate") means "release the physical body and transform into a ''xian''" (see the ''Shiji'' below). ''Yǔhuà'' (羽化, with "feather; wing") refers to an insect "growing wings; [[eclosion]]", which Daoists semantically extended to "die and become a ''xian'' flying up to heaven"; wings are a common feature in depictions of ''xian'', either riding a mythological flying creature or flying with their own wings—compare ''yǔrén'' (羽人, with "person") "''xian'' transcendent/immortal; Daoist priest". 

As detailed in "Early textual usages" below, the term ''xingjie'' (形解, "release of the form"), with ''xíng'' (形, "outward form, appearance, shape; figure, configuration; structure, contour, outline", Kroll 2007: 509), was a near synonym of ''shijie'' ("release from the corpse") that was recorded several centuries earlier. 

''Tuōsǐ'' (託死, "feign death; simulate death", later written 托死) frequently occurs in ''shijie'' contexts. Compare the Chinese Buddhist term ''tuōshēng'' (托生, "be reincarnated") that was also used in early Daoist texts.

==Translations==
The term ''shijie'' has been "variously and often poorly translated" (Robinet 1979: 58). Translational difficulty stems from ''shi'' "corpse", and the term is usually rendered "liberation or deliverance from the corpse". However, Kirkland points out that in most accounts of ''shijie'' the subject did not actually die, and although all the appearances of death were involved, no corpse was really left behind (2008: 897).

English translations include:
*"deliverance of the corpse" (Needham and Wang 1954)
*"corpse-freed", "release as a corpse" (Ware 1966)
*"corpse-free", "liberation from the corpse", "release from the mortal part" (Needham and Lu 1974)
*"deliverance from the corpse" (Robinet 1979, Kohn 1993)
*"liberation by means of a corpse" (Strickmann 1979)
*"liberation from the corpse" (Strickmann 1979, Campany 1996)
*"release from the corpse" (Pregadio 2004)
*"liberation from the corpse" (Campany 1996)
*"body liberation" (Pas 1998)
*"escape by means of a simulated corpse" (Campany 2002, Smith 2013)
*"release by means of a corpse", "mortuary liberation" (Kirkland 2008)
*"deliverance by means of a [simulated] corpse" (Kroll 2017)
*"release from the mortal body" (Pregadio 2018)
Within this sample, ''shi'' is usually translated as "corpse", and ''jie'' most commonly as "liberation" or "release".

==Early textual usages==
The word ''shijie'' ("release from/of the corpse") is first recorded in the c. 80 CE ''Lunheng'' below, but its near synonym ''xingjie'' (形解, "release from the form") occurs in earlier texts dating from around the 3rd to 1st centuries BCE. They do not use ''xingjie'' to denote a specific Daoist practice or method, but as general ways of transcending one's limited individuality (Pregadio 2004: 116). While ''shijie'' and ''xingjie'' are both instances of transcending the mortal body, they are not exactly the same, "release from the corpse" requires undergoing death but "release from the form" does not (Pregadio 2004: 117).

===''Zhuangzi''===
First, ''xingjie'' "release from the form" refers to a spiritual epiphany in the c. 3rd-2nd century BCE ''Zhuangzi'' story about Tian Zifang (田子方, Sir Square Field) praising his teacher Dongguo Xunzi (東郭順子, Sir Accord of Easturb) to the [[Marquess Wen of Wei]] (r. 446-397 BCE) (Pregadio 2004: 115).
&lt;blockquote&gt;After Sir Square went out, Marquis Wen spent the rest of the day in a state of dumb uncertainty. Then he summoned before him the officials who were standing on duty and said to them, "How far we are from the gentleman of complete integrity. At first I considered the words of the sages and the wise men, the practice of humaneness and righteousness to be the ultimate. But now that I have heard about Sir Square's teacher, my physical form is unstrung and I have no desire to move [吾形解而不欲動]; my mouth is clamped shut and I have no desire to speak. What I have emulated is only an earthen image, and the state of Wei has truly been an encumbrance to me." (tr. Mair 1994: 199) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Shiwen''===
Second, the term ''xingjie'' (形解, "release of the form") describes an advanced self-cultivation exercise in the "Shiwen" (十問, Ten Questions), a previously-unknown medical book within the c. 200-168 BCE [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] that archeologists discovered in a [[Western Han]] tomb (Pas 1998: 58). The fourth of the ''Shiwen'''s ten dialogues (MSVI.A.4) is between the mythical [[Yellow Emperor]] and Rong Cheng (容成), a legendary ancient master of [[Daoist sexual practices]] and ''[[Daoyin]]'' breath circulation techniques, who says, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Longevity is born of growth and accumulation. As for the fullness of that life: above it scans heaven and below it spreads over earth. The person who is capable of it invariably becomes a spirit. Thus he is capable of achieving release of the form. The person who perceives the great way skims the clouds as he moves. … like water flowing he can range far; like the dragon ascending he can rise high. (tr. Harper 1998: 390). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is the only ''Shiwen'' passage that reflects the likely influence of ''xian'' or "syncretistic-Daoist" ideas about transcendence/immortality in the Mawangdui and [[Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts|Zhangjiashan bamboo medical texts]], which primarily discuss maintaining health and attaining longevity. Harper notes that ''xingjie'' "release from the form" is thought to be synonymous with ''shijie'' "release from the corpse", which for the Daoist believer, marked the moment of ''xian'' transformation when a new, immortal physique was perfected and the mortal body sloughed off, leaving behind a husk-like corpse (or an object such as a sword or staff) as evidence that the adept had achieved ''shijie'' (citing Maspero 1981: 445–48). However, it is evident that ''xingjie'' in this ''Shiwen'' context, with references to "becoming a spirit" above and rising "like the dragon", does not represent the concepts of ''shijie'' in religious Daoism (Harper 1998: 114, 124).

===''Shiji''===
Third, ''xingjie'' names a supernatural technique in [[Sima Qian]]'s c. 94 BCE ''[[Shiji]]'' (Records of the Historian) passage denouncing the practices performed by some ''[[fangshi]]'' ("masters of the methods") from the state of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] who arrived at the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor of Qin]]'s court. These masters "practiced methods for immortality [僊道] and for the release from the form through dissolution and transformation [形解銷化], relying on services offered to gods and demons." (tr. Pregadio 2004: 115). The ''Shiji'' commentary cites Fu Qian 服虔 (c. 125-c. 195 CE), who glosses ''xingjie'' (形解) as ''shijie'' (尸解).

The abtruse meaning of this phrase ''xingjie xiaohua'' (形解銷化) is illustrated in other translations:
*"deliverance from the body which is dissolved and transformed" (Robinet 1979: 57)
*"release of the form and fluxing transformation" (Harper 1998: 114)
*"shed their mortal forms and melted away" (Kirkland 2008: 896)
Based upon this term ''xiao'' (銷, "melt [esp. metal]; dissolve"), some scholars (e.g., Robinet 1979: 66) believe ''xiaohua'' alludes to ''[[waidan]]'' External Alchemy practices, but Pregadio disagrees and says it refers to "thaumaturgic methods for replicating and multiplying one's form (ubiquity), or for dissolving it and hiding it (invisibility)" (2004: 115).

===''Lunheng''===
[[File:Cicada molting animated-2.gif|thumb|A [[cicada]] [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] molting its [[exoskeleton]] and transforming into a winged adult.]]
The iconoclastic philosopher [[Wang Chong]]'s c. 80 CE ''[[Lunheng]]'' (Balanced Inquiries) has earliest known occurrences of the term ''shijie'' "separation from the body" (tr. Alfred Forke).

The ''Daoxu'' (道虛, Daoist Untruths) chapter uses ''shijie'' six times in a passage refuting the legend that [[Li Shaojun]], a Daoist ''fangshi'' the court of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87), was several hundred years old when he died.
&lt;blockquote&gt; The ordinary students of ''Tao'' have not Li Shao Chün’s age. Before reaching a hundred years they die like all the others. Yet uncultured and ignorant people still hold that they are separated from their bodies, and vanish, and that, as a matter of fact, they do not die. What is understood by separation from the body? Does it mean that the body dies, and the spirit disappears? Or that the body does not die, but drops its coil? If one says that the body dies, and the spirit is lost, there is no difference from death, and every one is a genius. And if one believes that the body does not die, but throws off its coil, one must admit that the bones and the flesh of all the deceased Taoists are intact and in no wise different from the corpses of ordinary mortals. When the cricket leaves its chrysalis, the tortoise drops its shell, the snake its skin, and the stag its horns, in short, when the horned and skinned animals lose their outward cover, retaining only their flesh and bones, one might speak of the separation from the body. But even if the body of a dead Taoist were similar to a chrysalis, one could not use this expression, because, when the cricket leaves the chrysalis, it cannot be considered as a spirit with regard to the chrysalis. Now to call it a separation from the body, when there is not even a similarity with the chrysalis, would again be an unfounded assertion missing the truth. The Grand Annalist [i.e., [[Sima Qian]], the ''Shiji'' compiler] was a contemporary of Li Shao Chün. Although he was not amongst those who came near to Li Shao Chün’s body, when he had expired, he was in a position to learn the truth. If he really did not die, but only parted with his body, the Grand Annalist ought to have put it on record, and would not have given the place of his death. (tr. Forke 1907: 345-346) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wang Chong explains the ''shijie'' process with the ''chán'' (蟬, "cicada") analogy of a [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]] [[Moulting|molting]] its [[exoskeleton]], converting into an adult, and leaving behind its [[exuviae]]; the adept transforms the body and joins with the spirit into physical immortality, leaving behind some external object in the coffin to prove that the corpse disappeared (Pas 1998: 60). 

Forke also translates "separation from the body" for ''lixing'' (離形, "separate from the form") in another ''Lunheng'' chapter, ''Siwei'' (死偽, False Reports About the Dead). "The souls of the dead are dissolved, and cannot hear any more what men say. This inability to hear what others say is called death. If after their separation from the body they became ghosts, and kept near to men, their connection with the body would already have been severed, and, though people addressed them, it would be impossible for them to again enter the body. and close the eyes, or open the mouth." (1907: 207).

===Xiang'er ''Daodejing'' commentary===
The c. 190-200 CE ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the ''[[Daodejing]]'', which is central to the Daoist [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] religious tradition, uses ''shi'' to mean not specifically a "corpse" but generally a "mortal body", either living or dead (Pregadio 2004: 116).

The ''Xiang'er'' commentary uses the uncommon terms ''shisi'' (尸死, "a corpse dies") and ''shisheng'' (尸生, "a corpse lives") to explain the last line in ''Daodejing'' Chapter 15, "Through this lack of fullness, they are able to disintegrate and be renewed" [能辭復成]" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 117). Bokenkamp interprets ''shisheng'' literally, "When the corpse perishes, that is disintegration; when it lives, that is "renewal" [尸死為弊尸生為成]. Only by holding to the Dao without allowing one's will to overflow is one able to transform disintegration into renewal." (1997: 100). Pregadio translates ''shi'' as "mortal body", "When the mortal body dies, that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives, that is accomplishment. Only by guarding the Dao without being full and overflowing is one able to transform wearing out into accomplishment." (2004: 117); noting that the passage refers to options given to a living person for their "mortal body", and not to a postmortem renewal for their "corpse".

The commentary to two ''Daodejing'' chapters describe an early Daoist understanding of transcendence. The adept ''tuōsǐ'' (託死, "feigns/simulates death") and goes to the ''Tàiyīn'' (太陰, Palace of Great Darkness, in the extreme north of the heavens), where their bodily form is refined, in analogy with alchemically [[Refining (metallurgy)|refining]] base metals, resulting in ''fusheng'' (復生, "rebirth" or "second birth") in a body that preserves itself indefinitely (Pregadio 2018: 387). On the other hand, the damned are consigned to ''dìguān'' (地官, Earth Office), equated with the ''[[Diyu]]'' (地獄, "earth prisons; purgatories") of later texts. While the Celestial Masters recognized that death was inevitable, they sought longevity not through extended life in this world, but through the avoidance of death, described in terms of "feigned death" and continued existence in the next life (Bokenkamp 1997: 47).

''Daodejing'' Chapter 33 ends with the baffling phrase "Those who die without perishing are longevous [死而不亡者壽]", which the ''Xiang'er'' commentary explains.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When a Daoist's practices are complete, the spirits of the Dao call that person to return. Departing the world through feigned death [避去託死], the person passes through Grand Darkness to be born again and not perish. That is longevity. Commoners have no good merits, and when they die, they belong to the Earth Office. That is to perish. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 135) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare Seidel 's translation, "When he retires from the world, he ''simulates'' death and passes over to the realm of the Extreme Yin (''Taiyin'')" (1987: 230).

For the Chapter 16 passage "Their bodies obliterated, they do not perish [沒身不殆]", the commentary says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Grand Darkness is the palace where those who have accumulated the Dao refine their forms [煉形]. When there is no place for them to stay in the world, the worthy withdraw and, feigning death [避去託死], pass through Grand Darkness to have their images reborn on the other side. This is to be "obliterated without perishing." The profane are unable to accumulate good deeds, so when they die it is truly death. They are taken away in service of the Earth Offices. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 102) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Pregadio specifically translates ''lianxing'' (煉形) as "refine their [bodily] forms", and says, "Since the release from, or rather of, the mortal body is a necessary step to continue one’s cultivation, the refining process takes place after one who is ready for it has "simulated death". Leaving one’s mortal body and refining one’s form results, at first, in entering again into a state in which neither form nor matter exist, but only a ''xiang'' (象, image, appearance). After the adept’s bodily form has been refined, the process culminates in his "rebirth"." (2018: 387).

The ''Xiang'er'' commentary refers to those who lose faith in the Dao as ''xíngshī'' (行尸, "mobile corpses"). While received texts of Chapter 7 have "Is it not just because he does not strive for any personal end that all his personal ends are fulfilled?" (tr. Watson, 非以其無私耶故能成其私), the commentary has ''shi'' (尸, "corpse") instead of ''si'' (私, "self-interest; selfish concerns"), thus, "Because he is without a corpse, he is able to perfect his [mortal] corpse." 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The bodies of those who do not know the Dao of long life are but mobile corpses. It is not the Dao that they practice, but merely the way of the corpses. The reason the people of the Dao are able to achieve the longevity of Transcendents is that they do not practice the way of the corpses. They differ from the vulgar and thus are able to perfect their corpses, allowing them to enter the ranks of the Transcendent nobility. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 85) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Liexian zhuan''===
Beginning with the c. 2nd century CE ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' (Biographies of Exemplary Immortals), numerous [[hagiographies]] of Daoist masters directly or indirectly mentioned them transcending death through ''shijie''.  While many religious traditions maintain that a believer can ascend to heaven and leave behind a body, Daoist accounts of ''shijie'' are notable for denying that a real corpse was left behind (Kirkland 2008: 896).

Several ''Liexian zhuan'' hagiographies mention discovering ''wushi'' (無屍, "corpseless") coffins, implying that the adept had used ''shijie'', but only one directly refers to ''shijie'' (屍解). Kou Xian (寇先) was a legendary fisherman in the [[Zhou dynasty]] state of [[Song (state)|Song]] who lived on the banks of the Sui River (睢水) for over a century. Duke Jing (景公) of Song (r. 516-451) asked Kou to teach the ''Dao'' of longevity, but he refused and the duke had him executed. Several decades later Kou Xian was seen playing a ''[[Guqin|qin]]'' lute by the Song city gate, revealing that he evaded death by means of ''shijie''. In later texts, this was interpreted as ''bingjie'' (兵解, "escape by execution") (Campany 2009: 125).

===Taiqing texts===
The ''Taiqing'' (太清, Great Clarity) school of Daoism, which preceded the better-known [[Shangqing School]] (Highest Clarity), devised new ''shijie'' methods using documents to [[gaming the system|game]] the spirit-administration system that regulates and enforces human lifespans. In contrast to the Jewish and Christian beliefs that God records the name of every person in the ''[[Book of Life]]'' and ''[[Book  of Life#Book of Jubilees|Book of Death]]'',  the Chinese believed that the otherworldly death ledger system operated like the imperial system of census [[family register|family registration]], with scribes keeping track of people by their names and registered places of residence.

Two exemplary ''Taiqing'' scriptures, both mentioned in the c. 320 ''[[Baopuzi]]'' below, describe novel ''shijie'' procedures: placing a [[Brief (law)|brief]] listing one's own name and registration data onto one's grandfather's corpse during the funeral, and creating a Daoist ''[[Fulu|fu]]'' (符, supernatural talisman) asserting the cause of death was illness (Campany 2002: 57). Both ''shijie'' procedures require that the adept and substitute corpse have similar surnames and home districts.

First, the "Taiqing yinye shenqi jing" (太清金液神氣經, Grand Purity Scripture of the Divine Pneumas of Potable Gold') quotes the mythical [[Yellow Emperor|Yellow Thearch]]'s instructions for preparing a legalistic brief and incantation in order to falsify the life and death ledger system.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Human Sovereign|Sovereign of Humanity]] (人皇) is familiar with all the registers of the living and the dead (死生之錄). He knows the names of the hundred ghosts and he records the surnames and bynames of the myriad spirits. If you seek a method of extending your years and increasing your longevity, you should prepare a brief (疏) to the Sovereign of Humanity, fully listing your own surname and given name, the year, month, and day of your birth anniversary, and the province, commandery, district, hamlet, village, sector, and earth-god shrine under whose jurisdiction you [are registered as] residing. Then, at the funeral of your grandfather, place this brief in the tomb and incant (祝) as follows: 'Whatever is born must die; allotted life span should accord with the registers. My name was not recorded in the Great Dark Storehouse (大幽藏), yet now I am already set to rest in Haoli. Roaming in the infernal realms, I wail over this in eternal vexation.' Having completed [this incantation], return home. In addition, you must change your surname and byname; these must not be the same as before. Thereupon you will not die in a thousand autumns or a myriad years; for the ledgers have already been fixed, and your name has forever been expunged." (tr. Campany 2002: 53-54) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:太上洞玄靈寶五符序-靈寶太玄陰生之符red.svg|thumb|The Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding, with graphic components of ''bìngsǐ'' (病死, died of illness), ''shi'' (尸, corpse), and ''gui'' (鬼, ghost).]]

Second, the ''Lingbao wufu xu'' (靈寶五符序, Explanations on the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans) promises earthbound transcendence to those who follow a complex procedure involving a poisonous [[waidan|alchemical elixir]], a mystical Daoist talisman, death meditation (cf. Buddhist ''[[Maraṇasati]]''), and a ''shijie'' simulated corpse. The text gives instructions for compounding and ingesting a mercury-based elixir called ''shijie yao'' (尸解藥, ''shijie'' drug), and writing out in red characters (as for an imperial edict) the Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding (靈寶太玄陰生之符), which includes stylized [[Chinese calligraphy]] for ''bingsi'' (病死, died of illness), ''shi'' (尸, corpse), and ''gui'' (鬼, ghost). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;After you have ingested the Medicine for the Release from the Mortal Body for the prescribed number of days, write the talisman [of the Highest Mystery of Living Unseen] in red on white silk, and place it on your belly. On a ''wu'' or ''ji'' day [in the [[sexagenary cycle]]], lie down, your head pointing towards the west, and visualize yourself being dead [思念自作死人]. After quite some time, take off your clothes, leave them where you have lain, and head straight to enter the mountains. When you are far away, change your name. Never return to your hometown. Right after you have left, people will find that where you had lain there is a corpse. But suddenly, after a while, no one will know where your corpse is to be found. (tr. Pregadio 2018: 390) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This Taiqing account shows that ''shijie'' "release from the mortal body" requires ''[[memento mori]]''-like meditation practices and ritual aspects. The adept literally "stages" his or her death, and the "audience" of family members or Daoist companions participate in the "performance". They state that the corpse disappeared and was replaced by another object, such as a sword or staff. This ''shijie'' object performs the same function as played by the ''tishen'' (替身, "replacement bodies") in early funerary rites. In a ritual sense, the object replaces the deceased, whether the adept's death is real or only "simulated" (Pregadio 2018: 390-391). The same scripture also describes how to make male and female versions of a talisman for "masters of the Dao who wish to perform ''shijie''", which when written with a "spirit-brush" (神筆) on any wood or metal object will immediately transform it into a substitute cadaver that will subsequently "die and depart" (Campany 2002: 54).

Comparing the two documentary ''shijie'' procedures, Campany finds common elements. Both involve a ritual performance (an incantation protesting one's untimely death, meditating on oneself as a corpse). Each uses an administrative document to magically activate an object (one's grandfather's corpse, one's discarded clothing) that creates an illusory substitute corpse. Both mandate a complete [[name change]].

The usual interpretation for a practitioner who performs ''shijie'' to change their name is as a simple trick to elude the spirits enforcing the "registers of life and death" for each person's lifespan; the adept changes their name in the belief that the spirit-bureaucrats would be unable to locate them and cause their death. On a deeper level, Pregadio notes the [[homophone|homophonous]] correspondence between ''gǎimíng'' (改名, changing name) and ''gǎimìng'' (改命, changing destiny), and says the change of name does not merely intend to cheat the spirits, but is symbolically equivalent to the meditational and ritual act of "taking off one's clothes", that is, discarding one’s old persona (Pregadio 2018: 391).

===''Baopuzi''===
The Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]]'s c. 320 ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (Master who Embraces Simplicity) reflects contemporary understanding of ''shijie'' during the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265–420). Two "Inner Chapters" mention ''shijie'', and Ge's appended "Daoist Library" records the ''Shijie jing'' (尸解經, Classic of ''Shijie''), which is no longer extant (Ware 1966: 382).

One passage about the 2nd century BCE ''fangshi'' Li Shaojun (李少君, mentioned in the ''Lunheng'' above) lists ''shijie'' as the lowest category of ''xian'' transcendents after ''[[tian]]'' (heavenly) and [[Di (Chinese concept)|di]]'' (earthly).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The manuals of the immortals say that masters of the highest category are able to raise themselves high up into the aery void; these are called 'celestial immortals' [''tianxian'' 天仙]. Those of the second category resort to the famous mountains (and forests) and are called 'terrestrial immortals' [''dixian'' 地仙]. As for those of the third category they simply slough off the body after death, and they are called 'corpse-free immortals' [''shijiexian'' 尸解仙]. (2, tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 106, adapted from Ware 1966: 47, "Corpse-freed Genii") &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on Han dynasty sources, Ge Hong concludes that Li Shaojun must have been a ''shijiexian'' because long after his death from illness, [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87) had the coffin opened, and it was found to contain "only a gown and hat". Ge gives three other [[Eastern Han]] (25-220 CE) adepts who were ''shijie'' transcendents. Xie Yuanyi (謝元一) took Fei Changfang (費長房) away and left "a bamboo effigy to be buried in his place"; Li Yiqi (李意期) and two disciples "died" in [[Pidu District|Pixian]], but when their families opened their coffins they found in each "a bamboo staff with red writing on it" (tr. Ware 1966: 47-48). 

In another ''Baopuzi'' passage, Ge Hong denounced as a charlatan the healer Li Kuan (李寬), who treated illnesses with holy water and amulets and became extremely popular in south China. Ge's personal acquaintances who had witnessed Li's healing rituals, using "very shallow" recipes, unanimously said he was frail, senile, and no different from ordinary old people. After Li Kuan died from a virulent plague, his followers repeatedly claimed that he had metamorphosed into a ''xian'' transcendent through "release as a corpse and that his was not a true death". Ge concluded that Li's death proved he was "not the right type of individual" to become a ''shijiexian'' (tr. Ware 1966: 159-160).

In the ''Baopuzi'', Ge Hong considered processes like ''shijie'' to be perfectly natural. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When gold and jade are inserted into the nine orifices, corpses do not decay. When salt and brine are absorbed into flesh and marrow, dried meats do not spoil. So when men ingest substances which are able to benefit their bodies and lengthen their days, why should it be strange that (some of these) should confer life perpetual? (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 284, adapted from Ware 1966: 62) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
During [[Zhou dynasty]] funerals, amulets of jade, beads or cicadas, were placed in the mouth of the dead (Needham et al. 1976: 3).

===''Shenxian zhuan''===
Besides the ''Baopuzi'', Ge Hong also compiled the ''[[Shenxian Zhuan]]'' (Biographies of Divine Transcendents) that provides more information about ''shijie'' than the earlier ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' above. Five hagiographies of ''xian'' directly mention ''shijie'' and many others allude to it with finding empty coffins, such as Ling Shouguang (靈壽光).
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ling Shouguang was a native of [[Fufeng County|Fufeng]]. At the age of over seventy obtained a method for [making] "efflorescence of vermilion" pills. These he synthesized and ingested, with the result that his appearance was that of a person in his twenties. By the first year of the [Latter] Han ''jian'an'' period [196 CE] he was already two hundred twenty years old. Later, without having shown any signs of illness, he "died" at the home of Hu Gang (胡岡) in [[Jiangling County|Jiangling]]. Over a hundred days after his funeral and burial, someone saw Ling in Xiaohuang. This person sent a letter to Hu Gang, who, upon receiving the letter, dug up the coffin and looked inside. It was empty except for an old shoe. (tr. Campany 2002: 232) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wang Yuan's (王遠) hagiography has a rare description of how the ''shijie'' process feels. Wang explains to his pupil Cai Jing (蔡經):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"By birth, you are destined to transcend the world; you will be chosen as a replacement for an office. But your knowledge of the Way is scant; your pneumas are few and you have much flesh. You cannot ascend [directly] in this condition, but must avail yourself of shijie. It's like passing out through a dog's hole [too narrow to permit a person easy passage], that's all." Then Wang declared to Cai the essential teachings, and left him. Soon Cai felt his entire body grow hot as if on fire. He craved cold water to bathe himself in; his entire family brought water and poured it over him, and it was like making steam by pouring water over hot rocks. This went on for three days. Then, once his bones had completely dissolved, he stood up, went into his room, and covered himself with a blanket. Suddenly he had vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell. (tr. Campany 2002: 260) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cai Jing's ''shijie'' is not merely escape by means of a simulated corpse that leaves behind the adept's possession (shoe, staff, etc.) but a transformative refinement that dissolves their bones (believed to be the seat of lifespan allotment) and leaves behind only their skin. Thus, Campany suggests translating Cai Jing's case as "'release from one's corpse', where the 'corpse' is all the dross of one's own former, impure body, refined away to leave one with a newly incorruptible body" (2002: 266).

The hagiography of Yin Changsheng (陰長生), who supposedly lived over three hundred years, estimates the frequency of adepts achieving ''shijie''. "In upper antiquity, there were many transcendents, so many that they cannot all be accounted for. But since the rise of the Han, only forty-five persons have attained transcendence—forty-six counting myself. Twenty of them did so via 'escape by means of a simulated corpse,' the rest all ascended to Heaven in broad daylight." (tr. Campany 2002: 275).

Campany summarizes five common features of ''shijie'' stories in the ''Shenxian zhuan'' and other early hagiographies.
#Some adepts, when about to perform ''shijie'', pretend to be ill and make a public announcement to that effect. This can now be seen as motivated by the need to make the "death" more believable—something necessary only if the death is being staged with intent to deceive. 
#When, after his feigned death, the adept is sighted alive, it is always at a distant place.
#When, after such a sighting, the coffin is opened and found devoid of a corpse, some other object is always present instead—a talisman, a sword, a piece of clothing, or an entire outfit in the shape of a body. These objects are the substrata of the ritually and meditationally produced, illusory corpse that replaced the adept's own body long enough for him to escape. They are, in fact, so many ''shi'' 尸—not in the sense of actual corpses but in the sense of ritual impersonator or simulacrum of the dead in the mortuary and commemorative rites.
#If, in the narrative, the adept ever returns home (and often he does not), he does so only after considerable time has passed—usually more than a generation.
#In some cases, the adept is said to have changed his names after performing ''shijie''. The ubiquity of sobriquets rather than proper names for the subjects of hagiographies is probably also due to the name-changing strategy for eluding detection by spirits. (Campany 2002: 58-59)
However, not every ''shijie'' narrative in the ''Shenxian zhuan'' conforms to these patterns. When [[Zuo Ci]] and [[Guo Pu]] were condemned to execution, they escaped through ''bingjie'' (兵解, "martial liberation") and simultaneously eluded the agents of both the imperial and the spirit world bureaucracies (2002: 59).

===''Zhen'gao''===
''Shijie'' is frequently mentioned in the 499 ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' (Declarations of the Perfected), which is [[Tao Hongjing]]'s collection of materials from the "[[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] revelations" that were allegedly given to the mystic [[Yang Xi]] (330-c. 386) by a group of Daoist Perfected Ones from 364 to 370. 

Several revelations concern ''shijie'' methods and the destinies of Yang Xi and his aristocratic collaborators, Xu Mi (許謐, 303-376) and his son Xu Hui (許翽, 341-c. 370). Perfected Consort An (安妃) suggests ''jianjie'' (劍解, escape by means of a sword; here written ''jiejian'' 解劍) to her spirit-fiancé Yang Xi, "My lord, if you can't abide the smoke from windblown flames and wish to embrace Perfected form in a secluded wood, then could you just seek the Way of escape by means of the sword and perform the technique of announcing [your own] end? If you finish yourself off, doing it openly or in secret and leaving your trace [corpse-simulacrum] concealed or in plain view are matters to be separately arranged at the last moment. It's all up to you, discerning lord!" (tr. Smith 2013: 101). 

A ''Zhen'gao'' revelation from Mao Gu (茅固), one of the Three Lords Mao, discloses to Xu Mi that his missing elder brother Xu Mai (許邁, 300-348), had paired with a Perfected partner, retreated into the mountains, and escaped from the world by means of a "simulated corpse" (Smith 2013: 18). Another context says Xu Mai studied under his teacher Wang Shilong (王世龍), and "received the Way of loosening constraints [''jieshu zhi dao'' 解束之衜], practiced the method of walking backward, consumed jade fluid, and had audience at Brain-Essence [Palace]". This "Way of loosening constraints" may refer to the ''shijie'' variety called ''jiedai'' (解帯, escape leaving one's waistband behind) (Smith 2013: 276). Others revelations tell Xu Hui that he will perform a "nocturnal escape", which apparently means staging death under cover of night, without using a simulacrum like a sword or staff, and tell Xu Mi that he is too preoccupied with worldly affairs to escape immediately (Smith 2013: 299).

''Zhen'gao'' passages provide a general outline of a complicated ''shijie'' process, which goes through several stages, usually over a span of many years. First, the practitioner must become "suitably detached" from worldly affairs. Second, one must be in the correct frame of mind that views life and death as opposite banks of the same river—"both are equal and essential". Third, after one escapes, the ''[[Hun and po|hun]]'' cloud-souls go to Grand Yin, the ''po'' earth-souls enter the earth, and the Four Numina and Five Male Ones preserve the body's seminal essence and five viscera. Fourth, once the cloud-souls arrive at Grand Yin (a place far in the north), they undergo further refinement, in a process like that which takes place in the alchemist's sealed crucible. Finally, all those who are fit for the process inevitably wake up as Perfected. "Only then can the practitioner truly understand the wondrousness of the spirit immortals' "dying but not perishing" and the profundity of the principles governing life and death". (Smith 2013: 300).

[[Zhao Cui]] (d. 622 BCE) was a legendary Daoist transcendent who assisted [[Duke Wen of Jin]] (r. 636-628), and the ''Zhen'gao'' records that five to six years after he died, "a man travelling through the mountains one evening spotted this corpse inside a rock chamber. The flesh had rotted, but the bones remained. He also saw that the five viscera in the abdomen were still alive as before. The [bodily] fluids and blood were wrapped in bundles therein; a purple placenta was woven on the outside." (tr. Smith 2013: 302-303)

Many ''Zhen'gao'' passages mention alchemical drugs as a means to achieving ''shijie'' "release from the corpse". Chinese alchemists were  aware that the metallic compounds produced in their furnaces were highly poisonous, but they believed that the practitioner would suffer only an apparent death while in fact passing into the heavens without dying (Bokenkamp 1997: 291; Smith 2013: 284). One context lists historical figures who achieved ''shijie'' by consuming the powerful alchemical [[Langgan#Alchemy|Elixir of Langgan Efflorescence]], which was compounded from [[toxic heavy metal]]s.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who feigned construction of a tomb after swallowing Efflorescence of Langgan are Yan Menzi [衍門子], Gao Qiuzi [髙丘子], and Master Hongyai [洪涯先生]. The residents of the three counties (in which their graves are found) all call them vacant tumuli of the dead of highest antiquity. They are unaware, though, that on one occasion Gao Qiuzi entered Mount Liujing through liberation by means of a corpse. He afterwards consumed a powder of Liquefied Gold [金液], then ingested Efflorescence of Langgan at Zhongshan and feigned the appearance of still another death, whereupon he at last entered Xuanzhou [玄州, "dark region" netherworld]. (tr. Strickmann 1979: 131, cf. Needham and Lu 1974: 296) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These practitioners notably do not ascend into the Shangqing heavens but live among the terrestrial paradises. 

The Shangqing School founder, [[Wei Huacun]], who supposedly performed ''shijie'' herself (Bokenkamp 1997: 251), describes some others who performed it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Finding the Way and leaving the world is done either visibly or in secret. Using the body to leave a trace behind is the secret [approach to] the Way. Some have taken two swigs of rose-gem essence and knocked on their coffins, or consumed a speck of it once and had their corpses rot. Sire Deerskin swallowed jade blossoms and the maggots streamed out his door; Youngest Son Qiu gulped the gold fluid and the stench was smelled a hundred ''Ii'' away. The Yellow Thearch, who fired the nine cauldrons [elixir] on Mount Jing, still has a tomb at Qiao Peak; Sima Jizhu, who consumed mica powder to make a covert ascent, still [left his] head and feet in different places. Mo Di gulped rainbow elixir to throw himself into a river; Young Ning consumed stone brains and rushed into a fire. Wu Guang cut leeks to enter Qingling Pool; Bocheng Zigao absorbed pneumas, and his guts rotted three times. People like these are beyond count. Isn't the Way subtle? In finding it, the traces of one's inclinations and aversions are never constant." (tr. Smith 2013: 295-298) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sima Jizhu (司馬季主) was a diviner for Han Emperor Wen (r. 180-157 BCE); "head and feet in different places" (''tóuzúyìchù'' 頭足異凥) is a [[fixed expression]] for beheaded persons. The ''Zhen'gao'' translator Thomas E. Smith describes Wei Huacun as employing "graveyard humor", such as the name for [[Mica#Mica powder|mica powder]], ''yunsan'' (云散, lit. "disperse like clouds") with ''san'' (散 also meaning "scatter; vanish; ([[Traditional Chinese medicine|TCM]]) powdered medicine"), which is a pun for "vanishing powder" (2013: 300).

The ''Shangqing'' classic ''Jianjing'' (劍巠, Sword Scripture) compares several ''shijie'' alchemical preparations and says the ''lingwan'' (靈丸, Numinous Bolus) elixir is the only one that permits the adept to return home without changing his or her name. The ''Zhen'gao'' Appendix to the ''Jianjing'' describes the range of different techniques.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who manage to escape by means of the corpse through the use of other medicines and are not transformed by means of the Numinous Bolus may not, in any case, return to their hometowns, for the Three Offices would detain them. There are those who die and revive. There are those who get beheaded, only to emerge [again] from one side. There are those whose corpses disappear before encoffinment. There are those whose human forms remain but whose bones are not recovered, those whose clothes remain but whose forms disappear, and those whose hair falls out but whose forms are lost. Departing in broad daylight is called a superior escape by corpse, and departing at midnight is called an inferior escape by corpse. (Smith 2013: 304-305) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This passage distinguishes two grades of ''shijie'' by the time of day when the adept leaves the world, superior ''bairi'' (白日, daytime; broad daylight) and inferior ''yeban'' (夜半, midnight). The term ''bairi'' is usually translated as "in broad daylight" but more precisely means "midday; noon", in contrast to ''shijie'' proper at midnight. Hagiographies of Daoist immortals provide many examples of ascension to Heaven occurring exactly at midday, often expressed with the stock phrase ''bairi shengtian'' (白日昇天, "ascending to Heaven in broad daylight"). These two ways of deliverance are distinguished by opposite but corresponding ''[[Yin and yang|yinyang]]'' features: ascent and descent, midday and midnight, light and darkness, sun and moon. On one hand, ascent to Heaven is the way of non-return to the world, a spiritual journey ascending from one empyrean to the next. On the other, descent to Great Darkness is the way of return, one obtains a "second birth" and eventually comes back to the world (Pregadio 2004: 122).

The reason for this inferior status of an adept who performs ''shijie'' is that despite their having attained an advanced spiritual state, it is insufficient for them to "ascend to heaven in broad daylight", and they need to undergo a transformational "refining the bodily form". As long as the adept continues dwelling in their physical body, they are able to focus upon creating their perfected body (Pregadio 2018: 391).

[[File:Li Tieguai, by Huang Shen, 1757.jpg|thumb|[[Huang Shen]]'s painting of Li Tieguai, 1757]]
Logically, a question about ''shijie'' occurs: "If "release from the corpse" serves to leave one’s ordinary body and to generate a "perfected body", why would an adept ever return to their mortal body from which they wanted to be liberated?" The famed legend of [[Li Tieguai]] ("Iron-Crutch Li"), one of the [[Eight Immortals]] in the Daoist pantheon, illustrates that the function of this "recovered" body is to provide a means to cultivate the "perfected" body. Once when Li Tieguai was in deep meditation, his spirit left his body and was roaming in the heavens, but his disciples mistakenly thought that he had died and cremated what they believed was his corpse. When his spirit returned, Li realized that since his original body was no longer available, he had to enter the only available corpse, that of a lame beggar who had recently starved to death. Thus, what is to be "perfected" through ''shijie'' is not the physical form, Iron-Crutch only needed a body in order to continue his Daoist practices. "Even in this uncommon case of a forced "release from the mortal body", the focus of the practice is the perfected body." (Pregadio 2018: 392).

The ''Zhen'gao'''s Examination of the Corpse section is widely quoted (Strickmann 1979: 182). It gives wide-ranging criteria for verifying ''shijie'' "escape by an apparent corpse", reflecting the wide variety of escape methods and contingent factors (e.g., choosing to escape openly or secretly) that would tend to leave different signs on the corpse.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When a person dies, you must look at the body. If it is like that of a living person, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If you see that the feet are not blue and the skin is not wrinkled, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If the light of the eyes is undimmed and no different from that of a living person, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If all the head hair has fallen out but the body and bones are missing, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If an [apparent] escape by corpse occurs in broad daylight, then even though [the person] is an immortal it is not an instance of escape by corpse. (tr. Smith 2013: 300-301) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Most of these criteria would allow a deceased master's disciples to announce that he or she had successfully achieved ''shijie'' "escape by corpse", except the one "broad daylight" criterion for not attaining ''shijie'' that actually indicates the highest form of transcendence, directly rising to heaven. Declaring successful ''shijie'' is easy, "none of the criteria are negative indicators of a failed quest". (Smith 2013: 301).

===''Daojiaoyishu''===
Even though the word ''shijie'' (尸解) was in use during the 1st century CE, before Buddhism had any influence in China, the meaning was probably later influenced by ''jiětuō'' (解脫)—the Chinese Buddhist translation of ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation, emancipation, release) (Pas 1998: 58). Cross-borrowings between Buddhism and Daoism were so pervasive that many narratives about [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] include supposedly distinctive Daoist practices such as ''shijie'' (liberation from the corpse) and ''[[Bigu (grain avoidance)|bigu]]'' (grain avoidance) (Campany 1996: 329, 2009: 59). For instance, the 648 ''[[Book of Jin]]'' records that the Buddhist monk Shan Daokai (單衜開), a contemporary of the Central Asian missionary [[Fotudeng]] (c. 232-348 CE), "achieved a cicada-like metamorphosis by ingesting pills" (Needham et al. 1976: 112).

The c. 700 Buddhist-influenced text ''Daojiaoyishu'' (衜敎義樞, Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings) describes ''shijie'' as the second of three types of ''bianhua'' transformations. 
The first is adepts who "ascend to Heaven in broad daylight" (''bairi shengtian'' 白日昇天), merge with the divine, and roam together with the gods, which means that "one's entire person ascends to Heaven".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The second [type of transformation] is "release from the corpse" (''shijie''). Some replace their corpse with a sword or a bamboo staff; all of a sudden, they rise up and go, and abruptly they are no longer there. Some leave behind their skin. Some receive a funeral and are buried, but then if their coffin is opened there is only a staff or a shoe. Some roam to the five sacred peaks, while some can rise to Heaven. In the Southern Palace (Nangong) there is the Court of Flowing Fire (''liuhuo zhi ting''); in the Golden Gate (Jinmen) there is the Water of Smelting Refinement (''yelian zhi shui''). All those who inwardly ascend to Heaven while they are alive must first go to the Court of Fire (''huoting'') in order to refine their form and spirit, while those who rise to heaven after their death must first go the Courtly Pond (''tingchi'') in order to refine their celestial soul(s) (''hun'') and body frame. All this accords with the results of their practice (''gongye''). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The third is "transfer by extinction" (''miedu'' 烕度, the Chinese Buddhist name for "[[Nirvana]]"), "The mortal form (''shixing'') does not become ashes, as if the corpse is guarded by the Great One ([[Chinese_theology#Taiyi|Taiyi]]) itself. Sometimes, after years, the corpse reverts to be a human being." (tr. Pregadio 2004: 118). The ''shijie'' implements such as a sword or shoe perform a function similar to the ''tishen'' (替身, "replacement bodies") used in some Daoist rites to represent the adept's negative and "unrefined" aspects, worldly bonds which made it impossible for one to achieve a higher form of liberation in life (Pregadio 2004: 125-126).

==Interpretations==
The term ''shijie'' "corpse deliverance" has "baffled scholars because the ideas and practices behind it have remained quite murky", perhaps owing to intentional secrecy among Daoist initiates (Campany 2002: 52). Academics cannot even decide how to translate the term. "Should we interpret it as deliverance of a person ''from'' the mortal coil of his corpse, as deliverance of a person's body from death and putrefaction, or as deliverance ''by means of'' a corpse? While arguments in favor of each of these interpretations have been offered, scholars essentially agree that "corpse deliverance" implies a freedom gained after either what really ''was'' or what ''appeared to be'' physical death."

The oldest explanation of ''shijie'' is the [[Metamorphosis#Insects|cicada metamorphosis]] metaphor, which later became a standard [[Chinese literature|Chinese literary]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]], both of which first appeared in Wang Chong's 1st-century ''Lunheng''. There are multiple parallels between a ''shijie'' practitioner leaving behind their (sometimes apparent) corpse and transforming into a ''xian'' transcendent and a cicada nymph [[ecdysis|moulting]] its [[exoskeleton]], emerging as an adult, and leaving behind an [[exuvia]]. 

The ''Shenxian zhuan'' above uses the term ''chántuì'' (蟬蛻), which means both "cicada slough" (used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]) and "free/extricate oneself", to describe Cai Jing after his body had melted away for three days, "only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell". [[Zhang Junfang (writer)|Zhang Junfang]]'s c. 1029 ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) Daoist encyclopedia describes ''jianjie'' transcendence as ''chánhuà'' (蟬化, "cicada transformation"), "When men use a precious sword for the deliverance of the body, this is the highest example of metamorphic transformations" (tr. Needham and Wang 1956: 141).

[[Joseph Needham]] and [[Lu Gwei-djen]] say that Daoist alchemists believed immortality elixirs could generate "a new physical but immortal self, embodying the whole personality, which could leave the adept's corpse like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, and go off to dwell among the other immortals". Two possible results of ''shijie'' "liberation from the corpse" were either an empty coffin if the physical body had fully etherealized, or the changeless perpetuation of an adept's light body, never showing any signs of post-mortem decomposition (1974: 284).

===Body preservation===
[[File:Xin Zhui 3.JPG|thumb|The perfectly preserved body of [[Xin Zhui]] (d. 163 BCE)]]
Needham and Lu also interpret that the remarkably well-preserved body of [[Xin Zhui]] or Lady Dai (d. 163 BCE), discovered in 1972 among [[Mawangdui]] tombs, showed that early Chinese mortuary specialists, whom they presume were Daoists, had sufficiently advanced chemical knowledge and skill to achieve an almost perpetual conservation, which suggests "for the first time all that [''shijie''] may have implied". Furthermore, they say this adds another dimension to the Daoist doctrine of [[Immortality#Physical immortality|physical immortality]] and suggests that traditional stories about incorruptible corpses were possibly based on fact (1974: 303-304). Lady Dai's body demonstrates that the Daoist conception of ''shijiexian'' "corpse-free immortals, whose bodies would remain century after century like those of persons still living, was not entirely imaginary (Needham et al. 1976: 21).

===Ritual suicide===
Michel Strickman convincingly proposed that the adept's "corpse" in ''shijie'' techniques was not always a temporary stand-in but in certain cases could be the cadaver of someone who achieved ''xian'' transcendence by means of [[Suicide methods#Ritual suicide|ritual suicide]] through [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]]. For a Daoist religious believer, suicide could sometimes be an  acceptable way to escape during periods of social or political trouble. For example, [[Ge Xuan]] (164-244) resorted to ''shijie'' to flee from the oppression of [[Emperor Wu of Jin]] (1979: 132-133).

In response, Isabelle Robinet contended that ''shijie'' "liberation from the body" was not a ritual suicide—an "interpretation that has grown up without any supporting evidence"—but instead a procedure of salvation after death. When a practitioner dies before completing spiritual purification, a kind of "partial death" takes place, with an afterlife in an intermediate realm while it awaits a more complete purification and final deliverance (1997: 138).

Ursula-Angelika Cedzich concurs with Strickman's ritual suicide hypothesis. In one of the best-documented cases, Tao Hongjing's disciple [[Tao Hongjing#Reclusion on Maoshan|Zhou Ziliang]] (周子良, 497-516) received visions from Perfected Ones who guaranteed him transcendence into Shangqing heavens, and gave instructions how to compound a deadly potion of mushrooms and cinnabar, with which he committed suicide (2001: 33-34, 37-39).

===Resurrection===
Another interpretation of ''shijie'' centers around similarities with [[resurrection]] as the concept of coming back to life after death. 

Donald Harper studied documents found in Late Warring States tombs, including an official report that recounts a spectacular resurrection story. A man named Dan (丹, cinnabar), who was employed by a general in the [[Wei (state)|Wei]] army, committed suicide in 300 BCE because he had murdered a man. After Dan's burial, however, the general filed an official bureaucratic complaint with the netherworld administration claiming that he had not yet been "fated" to die, and they subsequently released Dan from the grave and returned him to the world of the living in 297 BCE (1994: 13-14). However, it took several years after his resurrection before Dan could hear or eat food again, and "his four limbs were useless" (1994: 22-23). Harper suggests that the concept of ''shijie'' began around the 1st century CE from a synthesis of ancient beliefs about resurrecting the dead and the Daoist notion of ''xian'' transcendence/immortality, "shijie was a special form of resurrection with elements that distinguished it from an already existing belief in resurrection in popular religion" (1994: 25).

Julian Pas says that when Daoism adopted the ''shijie'' procedure, properly translated here not as "liberation from the body" but as "liberation through the body", it changed the focus from relying on official documents to revive a dead person to relying on self-cultivation to metamorphize into a ''xian'' transcendent (1998: 59). In addition, ''shijie'' has some parallels with Christian [[resurrection of the dead]] in which the deceased body is reunited with the soul. Describing the [[resurrection of Jesus]], the Bible says his tomb was found empty, except for some [[Empty tomb#Grave clothes|grave clothes]]—which is reminiscent of Daoist ''shijie'' cases when the master's coffin is found empty except for some article of clothing left behind (1998: 60).

===Escaping difficulties===
In some cases, a Daoist adept carrying out ''shijie'' "escape by means of a corpse" was not attempting miraculous transcendence but was simply absconding from difficult demands, such as when [[Emperor Wu of Jin]] indefinitely detained [[Ge Xuan]], he told his disciple, "I do not have the leisure to prepare the great drug [of immortality]. Now I will perform ''shijie''." (tr. Campany 2002: 59).

The ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' gives several examples. Xu Yang (許楊) was an expert in [[Chinese numerology]], but when the usurper [[Wang Mang]] conscripted him into the new government, Xu changed his name and became a famed healer in a distant province, and returned home only after the Han army had executed Wang Mang in 23 CE. For similar reasons, Feng Liang (馮良) supposedly killed his horse, smashed his carriage, tore his clothes to pieces, and disappeared. Everyone believed that wild animals had killed him, and his family buried the remains found at the site—but Feng returned more than ten years later (Cedzich 2011: 40).

Narratives involving this expedient type of ''shijie'' have common themes of [[name change]] and [[identity creation]] (Cedzich 2011: 27). This represents "a momentous abstention from the family lineage system that formed the spine of Chinese society" (Campany 2002: 55-56). The elaborate ''shijie'' process given above in the ''Lingbao wufu xu'' says, "After the adept has reached a safe place, they begin a new life under a pseudonym, but can never return home (where they might be recognized)." (tr. Campany 2002: 54). Finally, even the Shangqing patriarch [[Tao Hongjing]] himself, after years of unsuccessful alchemical experiments with immortality elixirs for [[Emperor Wu of Liang]] (r. 502-549), desperately attempted to flee his imperial patron in 508 by changing his name to Wang Zheng (王整) and pretending to be an ordinary soldier (Cedzich 2011: 40).

In [[biology]], a '''spore''' is a unit of [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] or [[asexual reproduction]] that may be adapted for [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] and for survival, often for extended periods of time, in unfavourable conditions. Spores form part of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycles]] of many [[plant]]s, [[algae]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[protozoa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/searchresults.html?cx=009557456284541951685%3A50nf_5tpvuq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=spore&amp;sa=Search Tree Of Life Web Project]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacterial spore]]s are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions. [[Myxozoa]]n spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection, but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium, which develops from the amoebula.&lt;ref&gt;"Myxozoa." Tree of Life web project. Ivan Fiala 10 July 2008. Web. 14 Jan. 2014. &lt;http://tolweb.org/Myxozoa/2460&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spores are usually [[haploid]] and [[unicellular]] and are produced by [[meiosis]] in the [[sporangium]] of a [[diploid]] [[sporophyte]]. Under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new [[organism]] using [[mitosis|mitotic]] division, producing a [[multicellular]] [[gametophyte]], which eventually goes on to produce gametes. Two gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as [[alternation of generations]].

The spores of [[seed plant]]s, however, are produced internally and the megaspores, formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units, the [[seed]]s and [[pollen]] grains.

==Definition==
The term ''spore'' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] word σπορά ''spora'', meaning "[[seed]], sowing", related to σπόρος ''sporos'', "sowing," and σπείρειν ''speirein'', "to sow."

In common parlance, the difference between a "spore" and a "[[gamete]]" (both together called gonites) is that a spore will germinate and develop into a [[sporeling]], while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.

The main difference between spores and seeds as [[Biological dispersal|dispersal units]] is that spores are unicellular, while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte that produces a developing embryo, the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation. Spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes, while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.

==Classification of spore-producing organisms==
===Plants===
[[Vascular plant]] spores are always [[haploid]]. Vascular plants are either '''homosporous (or isosporous)''' or '''heterosporous'''. Plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type. 

Heterosporous plants, such as [[seed plant]]s, [[spikemoss]]es, [[Isoëtes|quillworts]], and ferns of the order [[Salviniales]] produce spores of two different sizes: the larger spore (megaspore) in effect functioning as a "female" spore and the smaller (microspore) functioning as a "male". Such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia, either a '''megasporangium''' that produces megaspores or a '''microsporangium''' that produces microspores. In flowering plants, these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers, respectively.

===Fungi===
[[Fungus|Fungi]] commonly produce spores, as a result of sexual, or asexual, reproduction. Spores are always [[haploid]] and grow into mature haploid individuals through [[mitosis|mitotic]] division of cells. In multicellular species, the visible fungus is composed entirely of haploid cells. Only during sexual reproduction are [[diploid]] cells present, as a result of the fusion of two haloid gamate cells. These diploid cells produce the haploid spores.

==Classification of spores==
Spores can be classified in several ways:

===By spore-producing structure===
[[Image:Morelasci.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ascus|Asci]] of ''[[Morchella elata]]'', containing [[ascospores]]]]
[[Image:Microspore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In [[plant]]s, [[microspore]]s, and in some cases megaspores, are formed from all four products of meiosis.]]
[[Image:Macrospore-formation.svg|thumb|300px|In contrast, in many [[seed plant]]s and heterosporous [[fern]]s, only a single product of meiosis will become a [[megaspore]] (macrospore), with the rest degenerating.]]
====Fungi====
In fungi and fungus-like organisms, spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs. Since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures, these spores are often characteristic of a particular [[taxon]] of the [[fungi]].
* '''[[Sporangiospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[sporangium]] in many fungi such as [[zygomycete]]s.
* '''[[Zygospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[zygosporangium]], characteristic of [[zygomycete]]s.
* '''[[Ascospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[ascus]], characteristic of [[ascomycete]]s.
* '''[[Basidiospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[basidium]], characteristic of [[basidiomycete]]s.
* '''[[Aeciospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[aecium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Urediniospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[uredinium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Teliospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[telium]] in some fungi such as [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] or [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].
* '''[[Oospore]]s''': spores produced by an [[oogonium]], characteristic of [[oomycete]]s.
====Red algae====
* '''[[Carpospore]]s''': spores produced by a [[carposporophyte]], characteristic of [[red algae]].
* '''[[Tetraspore]]s''': spores produced by a [[tetrasporophyte]], characteristic of [[red algae]].

===By function===
* '''[[Chlamydospore]]s''': thick-walled resting spores of [[fungi]] produced to survive unfavorable conditions.
* '''[[Fungal infection in plants|Parasitic fungal spores]]''' may be classified into internal spores, which germinate within the host, and external spores, also called environmental spores, released by the host to infest other hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modares.ac.ir/elearning/Dalimi/Proto/Lectures/week15/biology.htm |title=Microsporidia (Protozoa): A Handbook of Biology and Research Techniques |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626082941/http://www.modares.ac.ir/elearning/Dalimi/Proto/Lectures/week15/biology.htm |archivedate=26 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}. modares.ac.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

===By origin during life cycle===
* '''Meiospores''': spores produced by [[meiosis]]; they are thus [[haploid]], and give rise to a haploid daughter cell(s) or a haploid individual. Examples are the precursor cells of [[gametophyte]]s of [[seed plant]]s found in [[flower]]s ([[angiosperm]]s) or [[Conifer cone|cones]] ([[gymnosperm]]s), and the [[zoospore]]s produced from meiosis in the sporophytes of algae such as ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''.
** '''[[Microspore]]s''': meiospores that give rise to a male [[gametophyte]], ([[pollen]] in seed plants).
** '''[[Megaspore]]s''' (or '''macrospores'''): meiospores that give rise to a female [[gametophyte]], (in seed plants the gametophyte forms within the [[ovule]]).
* '''[[conidium|Mitospores]]''' (or '''conidia''', '''conidiospores'''): spores produced by [[mitosis]]; they are characteristic of [[Ascomycetes]]. Fungi in which only mitospores are found are called "mitosporic fungi" or "anamorphic fungi", and are previously classified under the [[taxon]] [[Deuteromycota]] (See [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph]]).

===By mobility===
Spores can be differentiated by whether they can [[motility|move]] or not.
* '''[[Zoospore]]s''': mobile spores that move by means of one or more [[flagellum|flagella]], and can be found in some [[algae]] and [[fungi]].
* '''[[Aplanospore]]s''': immobile spores that may nevertheless potentially grow flagella.
* '''[[Autospore]]s''': immobile spores that cannot develop flagella.
* '''[[Ballistospore]]s''': spores that are forcibly discharged or ejected from the fungal [[fruiting body]] as the result of an internal force, such as buildup of pressure. Most [[basidiospore]]s are also ballistospores, and another notable example is spores of the genus ''[[Pilobolus]]''.
* '''[[Statismospore]]s''': spores that are discharged from the fungal fruiting body as the result of an external force, such as raindrops or a passing animal. Examples are [[puffball]]s.

==Anatomy==
Under high [[magnification]], spores can be categorized as either '''monolete spores''' or '''trilete spores'''. In monolete spores, there is a single line on the spore indicating the axis on which the mother spore was split into four along a vertical axis. In trilete spores, all four spores share a common origin and are in contact with each other, so when they separate, each spore shows three lines radiating from a center pole.

==Dispersal==
[[File:Fungus spore ejection.ogg|thumb|Spores being ejected by fungi.]]

In fungi, both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances. Many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures, such as [[hydrophobin]]s, for spore ejection. These mechanisms include, for example, forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of [[osmolyte]]s in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.&lt;ref name="Trail"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trail F.|year= 2007|title=Fungal cannons: explosive spore discharge in the Ascomycota|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=276|pages=12–8|pmid=17784861|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00900.x|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forcible discharge of single spores termed ''ballistospores'' involves formation of a small drop of water ([[Buller's drop]]), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 [[G-force|g]].&lt;ref name="Pringle et al."&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP |year= 2005|title=The captured launch of a ballistospore|journal=[[Mycologia]]|volume=97|pages=866–71|pmid=16457355|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.4.866|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces, exemplified by [[puffballs]]. Attracting insects, such as flies, to fruiting structures, by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour, for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy, most prominently used by the [[stinkhorns]].

In Common Smoothcap moss (''[[Atrichum undulatum]]''), the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, Lönnell, Sundberg and Hylander (2014) Release thresholds for moss spores: the importance of turbulence and sporophyte length. Journal of Ecology, n/a-n/a.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of spore-shedding [[vascular plant]]s such as [[fern]]s, wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal. Also, spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve; however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation. Their chief advantage is that, of all forms of progeny, spores require the least energy and materials to produce.

In the spikemoss ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'', dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]], a [[tumbleweed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = False Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophyllaFalse Rose of Jericho – Selaginella lepidophylla | work = Plant- and Flower guide| date = February 2009| url = http://www.plant-and-flower-guide.com/rose-of-jericho.html | accessdate = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
