[[File:Direktorium LDE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A meeting of a board of directors of the [[Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company]] in 1852]]
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013 }}

A '''board of directors''' is a recognized group of people who jointly oversee the activities of an [[organization]], which can be either a for-profit [[business]], [[nonprofit organization]], or a [[government agency]]. Such a board's powers, duties, and responsibilities are determined by government [[regulations]] (including the jurisdiction's [[corporations law]]) and the organization's own [[constitution]] and [[bylaws]]. These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet.

In an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and might be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually vote for the members of the board. In a [[stock corporation]], non-executive directors are voted for by the [[shareholder]]s and the board is the highest [[authority]] in the management of the corporation. The board of directors appoints the [[chief executive officer]] of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction. In corporations with dispersed ownership, the identification and nomination of directors (that shareholders vote for or against) are often done by the board itself, leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation. In a [[non-stock corporation]] with no general voting membership, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution;{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9}} its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/vanon.aspx#a4 | title = How are the directors selected? | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Commonwealth of Virginia, State Corporation Commission, Business FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf | title = Chapter 181, Nonstock Corporations (Sect. 181.0804) | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Wisconsin Statutes Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Other names include '''board of directors and advisors''', '''[[board of governors]]''', '''board of managers''', '''[[Board of Regents|board of regents]]''', '''board of [[trustees]]''', or '''board of visitors'''. It may also be called "the executive board" and is often simply referred to as "the board".{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

==Roles==
{{Business administration}}
Typical duties of boards of directors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementhelp.org/boards/brdrspon.htm |title=Overview of Roles and Responsibilities of Corporate Board of Directors |accessdate=2008-01-26 |last=McNamara |first=Carter |work=Free Management Library |publisher=Authenticity Consulting, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |title=Basic Role of the Board |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=Governance Basics |publisher=Institute on Governance (Canada) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230201729/http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |archivedate = 30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* governing the organization by establishing broad policies and setting out strategic objectives;
* selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the [[chief executive]] (of which the titles vary from organization to organization; the chief executive may be titled [[chief executive officer]], [[President (corporate title)|president]] or [[executive director]]);
* terminating the chief executive;
* ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;
* approving annual budgets;
* accounting to the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s for the organization's performance;
* setting the salaries, compensation and benefits of senior management;

The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization, and between  jurisdictions. For [[public corporations|companies with publicly trading stock]], these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.

Typically, the board chooses one of its members to be the ''[[chairman]]'' (often now called the "chair" or "chairperson"), who holds whatever title is specified in the [[by-law]]s or [[articles of association]]. However, in membership organizations, the members elect the president of the organization and the president becomes the board chair, unless the by-laws say otherwise.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}}

==Directors==
The directors of an organization are the persons who are members of its board. Several specific terms categorize directors by the presence or absence of their other relationships to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;This section was developed from numerous definitions in [http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/inside-director/ USLegal.com], [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html BusinessDictionary.com], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/executive+director Dictionary.com], The Free Dictionary by Farlex ([http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inside+Director "inside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/executive+director "executive director"]; [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/outside+director "outside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonexecutive+director "nonexecutive director"]), [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/executive-director Macmillan Dictionary], and  [http://www.economics-dictionary.com/definition/non-executive-director.html Economics-dictionary.com]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inside director===
An inside director is a director who is also an employee, officer, chief executive, major [[shareholder]], or someone similarly connected to the organization. Inside directors represent the interests of the entity's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], and often have special knowledge of its inner workings, its financial or market position, and so on.

Typical inside directors are:
* A [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) who may also be [[Chairman|chairman of the board]]
* Other executives of the organization, such as its [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[executive vice president]]
* Large shareholders (who may or may not also be employees or officers)
* Representatives of other stakeholders such as labor unions, major lenders, or members of the community in which the organization is located

An inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an executive director (not to be confused with the title [[executive director]] sometimes used for the CEO position in some organizations). Executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization, such as finance, marketing, human resources, or production.&lt;ref name=Ivestopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-director.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside director===
{{Main|Independent director}}

An outside director is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization, and does not represent any of its stakeholders. A typical example is a director who is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of a firm in a different industry.&lt;ref name="Investopedia 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outside Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsidedirector.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside directors are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way.

Outside directors bring outside experience and perspectives to the board. For example, for a company that only serves a domestic market, the presence of CEOs from global multinational corporations as outside directors can help to provide insights on export and import opportunities and international trade options. One of the arguments for having outside directors is that they can keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run. Outside directors are unlikely to tolerate "insider dealing" between insider directors, as outside directors do not benefit from the company or organization. Outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors, or between shareholders and the board. They are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest. On the other hand, they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organization's governance and they might not know about the industry or sector in which the organization is operating.

===Terminology {{anchor|Classification}}===
*'''Director''' – a person appointed to serve on the board of an organization, such as an institution or business.
*'''Inside director''' – a director who, in addition to serving on the board, has a meaningful connection to the organization
*'''[[Outside director]]''' – a director who, other than serving on the board, has no meaningful connections to the organization
*'''Executive director''' – an inside director who is also an executive with the organization. The term is also used, in a completely different sense, to refer to a CEO
*'''[[Non-executive director]]''' – an inside director who is not an executive with the organization
*'''Shadow or ''de facto'' director''' – an individual who is not a named director but who nevertheless directs or controls the organization
* '''Nominee director''' – an individual who is appointed by a shareholder, creditor or interest group (whether contractually or by resolution at a company meeting) and who has a continuing loyalty to the appointor/s or other interest in the appointing company

Individual directors often serve on more than one board.&lt;ref name=Businessdictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice results in an [[interlocking directorate]], where a relatively small number of individuals have significant influence over a large number of important entities. This situation can have important corporate, social, economic, and legal consequences, and has been the subject of significant research.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Process and structure==
[[File:Tetley Board Room 31 August 2018 1.jpg|thumb|right|The board room of [[Tetley's Brewery]] in [[Leeds]], [[England]].]]

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

The process for running a board, sometimes called the [[board process]], includes the selection of board members, the setting of clear board objectives, the dissemination of documents or board package to the board members, the collaborative creation of an [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for the meeting, the creation and follow-up of assigned [[action items]], and the assessment of the board process through standardized assessments of board members, owners, and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school Board Process] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142343/http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of this process has been slow to develop due to the secretive nature of the way most companies run their boards, however some standardization is beginning to develop. Some who are pushing for this standardization in the USA are the [[National Association of Corporate Directors]], [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Consulting and The Board Group.

===Board meetings===

=== Size ===
Historically, nonprofit boards have not uncommonly had large boards with up to twenty-four members, but a modern trend is to have smaller boards as small as six or seven people.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/NWK6-E3CC|title=For Nonprofit Boards, Smaller is Better|last=White|first=Cyrus|date=|website=perma.cc|publisher=The South Cabin Group LLC|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that after seven people, each additional person reduces the effectiveness of [[group decision-making]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Non-corporate boards==
The role and responsibilities of a board of directors vary depending on the nature and type of business entity and the laws applying to the entity (see [[types of business entity]]). For example, the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market (public company), not traded on a public market (a private, limited or closely held company), owned by family members (a family business), or exempt from income taxes (a non-profit, not for profit, or tax-exempt entity). There are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, business trust, partnership, private limited company, and public limited company.

Much of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Bowen, William G., The board book: an insider's guide for directors and trustees (2008 W.W. Norton &amp; Co.); Murray, Alan S., Revolt in the boardroom: the new rules of power in corporate America (2007 Collins); Charan, Ram, Boards that deliver: advancing corporate governance from compliance to competitive advantage (2005 Jossey-Bass); Carver, John, Corporate boards that create value: governing company performance from the boardroom (2002 Jossey-Bass); Harvard Business Review on corporate governance (2000 Harvard Business School Press).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See specifically Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[board-only]] organization is one whose board is self-appointed, rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections; or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limited.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Membership organizations===
In [[Voluntary association|membership organizations]], such as a society made up of members of a certain profession or one advocating a certain cause, a board of directors may have the responsibility of running the organization in between meetings of the membership, especially if the membership meets infrequently, such as only at an [[annual general meeting]].{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481–483}} The amount of powers and authority delegated to the board depend on the bylaws and rules of the particular organization. Some organizations place matters exclusively in the board's control while in others, the general membership retains full power and the board can only make recommendations.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

The setup of a board of directors vary widely across organizations and may include provisions that are applicable to corporations, in which the "shareholders" are the members of the organization. A difference may be that the membership elects the officers of the organization, such as the president and the secretary, and the officers become members of the board in addition to the directors and retain those duties on the board.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}} The directors may also be classified as officers in this situation.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=572}} There may also be ex-officio members of the board, or persons who are members due to another position that they hold. These ex-officio members have all the same rights as the other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 2)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the board may be removed before their term is complete. Details on how they can be removed are usually provided in the bylaws. If the bylaws do not contain such details, the section on disciplinary procedures in ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations==
In a [[public company|publicly held company]], directors are elected to represent and are legally obligated as fiduciaries to represent owners of the company—the [[shareholder]]s/stockholders.   In this capacity they establish policies and make decisions on issues such as whether there is [[dividend]] and how much it is, [[Employee stock option|stock options]] distributed to employees, and the hiring/firing and [[Executive pay|compensation of upper management]].

===Governance===
Theoretically, the control of a company is divided between two bodies: the board of directors, and the [[shareholder]]s in [[general meeting]]. In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company. In small private companies, the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people, and thus there is no real division of power. In large [[public company|public companies]], the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.&lt;ref name=CRI&gt;[http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php Titles Associated with Executive Compensation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917083738/http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php |date=17 September 2012 }}| Compensation Resources Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more ''[[de facto]]'' power. Many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management, since each shareholder's power, as well as interest and information is so small.  Larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies. The large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize. However, there have been moves recently to try to increase [[shareholder activism]] among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings.&lt;ref name=CRI/&gt;

A contrasting view is that in large public companies it is upper management and not boards that wield practical power, because boards delegate nearly all of their power to the top executive employees, adopting their recommendations almost without fail.  As a practical matter, executives even choose the directors, with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them.

In most cases, serving on a board is not a [[career]] unto itself. For major corporations, the board members are usually professionals or leaders in their field. In the case of outside directors, they are often senior leaders of other organizations. Nevertheless, board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies. Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services. These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits. such as travel, hotel and meal expenses for the board meetings. [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm Fees, CEO Evaluation, and Ownership Structure]  By Joshua Kennon, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-tier system===
In some European and [[Asia]]n countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a [[supervisory board]] (elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. In these countries, the CEO (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a [[conflict of interest]] and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]]. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the CEO and their direct reports (other C-level officers, division/subsidiary heads).

{{Globalise/UK | section|date=April 2016}}

The development of a separate board of directors to manage/govern/oversee a company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history. Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of a company, and that the board of directors merely acted as an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.), citing ''[[Isle of Wight Rly Co v Tahourdin]]'' (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1906, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] had made it clear in the decision of ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise. The articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that "the directors and the directors alone shall manage."&lt;ref&gt;''Per'' Cozens-Hardy LJ at 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The new approach did not secure immediate approval, but it was endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Quin &amp; Axtens v Salmon'' [1909] AC 442 and has since received general acceptance. Under English law, successive versions of [[Table A]] have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.

The modern doctrine was expressed in ''[[John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw]]'' [1935] 2 KB 113 by [[Frederick Greer, 1st Baron Fairfield|Greer LJ]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been remarked{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in [[Table A]] (as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.&lt;ref&gt;
See Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.) at 185.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Election and removal ===

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

In most legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting{{efn|For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985.}} or through a [[proxy statement]]. For publicly traded companies in the U.S., the directors which are available to vote on are largely selected by either the board as a whole or a [[nominating committee]].&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Although in 2002 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[NASDAQ]] required that nominating committees consist of independent directors as a condition of listing,&lt;ref&gt;Chhaochharia V, Grinstein Y. (2007). [http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf Corporate governance and firm value: The impact of the 2002 governance rules] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611072244/http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf |date = 11 June 2010 }}. ''The Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt; nomination committees have historically received input from management in their selections even when the CEO does not have a position on the board.&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Shareholder nominations can only occur at the general meeting itself or through the prohibitively expensive process of mailing out ballots separately; in May 2009 the SEC proposed a new rule allowing shareholders meeting certain criteria to add nominees to the proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. (May 2009). [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-116.htm SEC Votes to Propose Rule Amendments to Facilitate Rights of Shareholders to Nominate Directors].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice for publicly traded companies, the managers ([[inside director]]s) who are purportedly accountable to the board of directors have historically played a major role in selecting and nominating the directors who are voted on by the shareholders, in which case more "gray outsider directors" (independent directors with conflicts of interest) are nominated and elected.&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999&gt;Shivdasani A, Yermack D. (1999). [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~eofek/PhD/papers/SY_CEO_JF.pdf CEO involvement in the selection of new board members: An empirical analysis]. ''Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors may also leave office by resignation or death. In some legal systems, directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors (in some countries they may only do so "with cause"; in others the power is unrestricted).

Some jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors, either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death, or as an addition to the existing directors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In practice, it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting. In many legal systems, the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her;{{efn|In the United Kingdom it is 28 days' notice, see sections 303(2) and 379 of the Companies Act 1985.}} the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director, who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 304(1) of the Companies Act 1985. A private company cannot use a written resolution under section 381A – a meeting must be held.}} The director may require the company to circulate any representations that he wishes to make.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see sections 303(2) and (3) of the Companies Act 1985.}} Furthermore, the director's contract of service will usually entitle him to compensation if he is removed, and may often include a generous "[[golden parachute]]" which also acts as a deterrent to removal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

A recent study examines how corporate shareholders voted in director elections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cai|first=Jay|author2=Garner, Jacqueline |author3=Walkling, Ralph |title = Shareholder Access to the Boardroom: A Survey of Recent Evidence |journal=Journal of Applied Finance |year=2010 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=15–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It found that directors received fewer votes from shareholders when their companies performed poorly, had excess CEO compensation, or had poor shareholder protection. Also, directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from a proxy advisory firm. The study also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing [[poison pill]]s or classified boards and by reducing excessive CEO pay after their directors receive low shareholder support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = J. | last2 = Garner | first2 = J.

Board accountability to shareholders is a recurring issue. In 2010, the ''New York Times'' noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] had found new positions as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Craig S, Lattman P. (2010). [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/companies-may-fail-but-directors-are-in-demand/?src=me&amp;ref=business Companies May Fail, but Directors Are in Demand]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC sometimes imposes a ban (a "D&amp;O bar") on serving on a board as part of its fraud cases, and one of these was upheld in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law360.com/articles/442382/sec-wins-d-o-bar-against-alleged-hedge-fund-scammer SEC Wins D&amp;O Bar Against Alleged Hedge Fund Scammer]. Law360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise of powers===
The exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings. Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a [[quorum]] must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Barber's Case'' (1877) 5 Ch D 963 and ''Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines'' (1889) 42 Ch D 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[common law]] countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties]]'' [1989] BCLC 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his [[ostensible authority]] (see also: [[Royal British Bank v Turquand|the rule in ''Turquand's Case'']]).

===Duties===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corporate benefit]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Directors' duties|Fiduciary duties}}

Because directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the [[shareholder]]s, the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties. The duties imposed on directors are [[fiduciary]] duties, similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust: [[agency (law)|agents]] and [[trustee]]s.

The duties apply to each director separately, while the powers apply to the board jointly. Also, the duties are owed to the company itself, and not to any other entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Percival v Wright'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders; they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, if the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that "depending upon all the surround circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder," ''Coleman v Myers'' [1977] 2 NZLR 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Proper purpose" ====
Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision in Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc]] |court=UKSC |division=|year=2015 |num=71 |date={{date|2015-12-02}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the powers of directors under the [[articles of association]] of the company to disenfranchise voting rights attached to shares for failure to properly comply with notice served on the shareholders.  Prior to that case the leading authority was ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd]]'' [1974] AC 821. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the "proper purpose" duty as separate from the "good faith" duty however.{{efn|This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288.}}

==== "Unfettered discretion" ====
Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.{{efn|Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''Clark v Workman'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''Dawson International plc v Coats Paton plc'' 1989 SLT 655.}} This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

===="Conflict of duty and interest"====

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

=====Transactions with the company=====

By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''Aberdeen Ry v Blaikie'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

:"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..." (''emphasis'' added)

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the company's constitution.

In many countries, there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985.}}

===== Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information =====
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, [[corporate opportunity|opportunities]], or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,{{efn|In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]]. They formed a new company ("Company B") to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than £5,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than £2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B – the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.}} held that:

: "(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves."

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

===== Competing with the company =====
Directors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

==== Common law duties of care and skill ====
Traditionally, the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''[[Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co]]'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

: "a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience." (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

: "such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf."

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom, the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name="NormanGoddard"&gt;''Norman v [[Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Remedies for breach of duty ====
In most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

====Current trends====
Historically, directors' duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members, and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the [[corporate benefit|financial benefit]] of the company. However, more recently there have been attempts to "soften" the position, and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Companies Act 2006]] requires directors of companies "to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole" and sets out the following six factors regarding a director's duty to promote success:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company's employees
* the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see, for example, s.309 which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves). The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Board and Society====

Most companies have weak mechanisms for bringing the voice of society into the board room. They rely on personalities who weren't appointed for their understanding of societal issues. Often they give limited focus (both through time and financial resource) to issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability. A Social Board &lt;ref&gt;Acre Resources LTD (2018), [https://www.acre.com/resources/the-case-for-a-social-board/ The Case for a Social Board], London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; has society designed into its structure. It elevates the voice of society through specialist appointments to the board and mechanisms that empower innovation from within the organisation. Social Boards align themselves with themes that are important to society.These may include measuring worker pay ratios, linking personal social and environmental objectives to remuneration, integrated reporting, fair tax and B-Corp Certification. 

Social Boards recognise that they are part of society and that they require more than a licence to operate to succeed.They balance short-term shareholder pressure against long-term value creation, managing the business for a plurality of stakeholders including employees, shareholders, supply chains and civil society.

===United States===

====Sarbanes–Oxley Act====

The [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of U.S. companies or companies listed on U.S. [[stock exchange]]s. Under the Act, directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes. [[Internal control]] is now the direct responsibility of directors. The vast majority of companies covered by the Act have hired internal auditors to ensure that the company adheres to required standards of internal control. The internal auditors are required by law to report directly to an audit board, consisting of directors more than half of whom are outside directors, one of whom is a "financial expert."

The law requires companies listed on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) to have a majority of independent directors—directors who are not otherwise employed by the firm or in a business relationship with it.

====Size====
According to the Corporate Library's study, the average size of publicly traded company's board is 9.2 members, and most boards range from 3 to 31 members. According to Investopedia, some analysts think the ideal size is seven.&lt;ref name=BoD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/03/111903.asp#ixzz27Kekd83e |title=Evaluating The Board Of Directors|publisher= investopedia.com|date= 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State law may specify a minimum number of directors, maximum number of directors, and qualifications for directors (e.g. whether board members must be individuals or may be business entities).&lt;ref name=BoD2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/corporate-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Corporate Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoD3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/nonprofit-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Nonprofit Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committees====
While a board may have several committees, two—the compensation committee and audit committee—are critical and must be made up of at least three [[independent director]]s and no inside directors. Other common committees in boards are nominating and governance.&lt;ref name=BoD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klgates.com/files/Publication/f44a6446-4d3a-4847-a157-319c05d9667b/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3900b2fd-2183-44e8-82d7-41bd4366f0f6/CompensationCommitteeStructure.pdf Compensation Committee Structure, Function and Best Practices] Richard E. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compensation====
Directors of [[Fortune 500]] companies received median pay of $234,000 in 2011. Directorship is a part-time job. A recent National Association of Corporate Directors study found directors averaging just 4.3 hours a week on board work.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/story/2011-10-25/director-compensation-rising/50918332/1 | work=USA Today | title=Company directors see pay skyrocket | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys indicate that about 20% of [[nonprofit foundation]]s pay their board members,&lt;ref name="Schambra"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schambra | first=William A. | title=Board Compensation: To Pay or Not to Pay? | work=Philanthropy magazine |date=Winter 2008 |publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable | url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/compensating_foundation_directors1 | accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2% of American [[nonprofit organization]]s do.{{sfn|BoardSource|2015|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite |author=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |title=Governance and Related Topics - 501(c)(3) Organizations |date=4 February 2008 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Author |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf |quote=Charities should generally not compensate persons for service on the board of directors except to reimburse direct expenses of such service. ...

===Criticism===
According to John Gillespie, a former investment banker and co-author of a book critical of boards,&lt;ref&gt;''Money for Nothing: How the Failure of Corporate Boards is Ruining American Business and Costing Us Trillions''&lt;/ref&gt; "Far too much of their time has been for check-the-box and cover-your-behind activities rather than real monitoring of executives and providing strategic advice on behalf of shareholders".&lt;ref name=comp/&gt; At the same time, scholars have found that individual directors have a large effect on major corporate initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rousseau|first1=Peter|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|title=Director Histories and the Pattern of Acquisitions|journal=Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=2015|volume=50|issue=4|pages=671–698|doi=10.1017/s0022109015000289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-border investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroup|first=Caleb|title=International Deal Experience and Cross-Border Acquisitions|journal=Economic Inquiry|volume=55|pages=73–97|date=November 28, 2015|ssrn=2037512|doi=10.1111/ecin.12365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[gender representation on corporate boards of directors]] has been the subject of much criticism in recent years. Governments and corporations have responded with measures such as legislation mandating gender quotas and [[comply or explain]] systems to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senden|first1=Linda|title=The Multiplicity of Regulatory Responses to Remedy the Gender Imbalance on Company Boards|journal=Utrecht Law Review|date=December 2014|volume=10|issue=5|pages=51–66|doi=10.18352/ulr.300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has found that certain social classes are also disproportionately represented on boards, with those from the upper and, especially, upper-middle classes tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/50376/3/Maclean_Harvey_Kling_OS_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Business History Review''''' is a scholarly quarterly published by [[Cambridge University Press]] for [[Harvard Business School]]. ''Business History Review'' is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering the field of business history. It was established in 1954 by Harvard University Press as the continuation of the ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = JSTOR: All Volumes and Issues - Browse - The Business History Review|url = https://www.jstor.org/journal/busihistrevi|website = www.jstor.org|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is one of the leading scholarly journals in the field of [[business history]] alongside ''[[Enterprise &amp; Society]]'' and ''[[Business History (journal)|Business History]]''.

The ''Business History Review'' traces it origins to 1926 with the publication of Harvard’s ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society''. The Bulletin aimed “to encourage and aid the study of the evolution of business in all periods and in all countries” and devoted much space to describing the growing archival collections of [http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/ Harvard’s Baker Library]. Henrietta Larson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Henrietta M. Larson Is Dead; Former Professor at Harvard|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/01/obituaries/henrietta-m-larson-is-dead-former-professor-at-harvard.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1983-09-01|access-date = 2015-08-12|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''Guide to Business History'' (1948)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guide to Business History — Henrietta M.

In 1954, the ''Bulletin'' changed its name to ''Business History Review'' and took its current format of publishing peer-reviewed research articles and book reviews.  In these years, the intellectual framework of the field of business history was defined by the work of [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred D. Chandler Jr.]], who published 11 research articles in the journal.  One of the most popular (with 212 Google Scholar cites) was his 1959 piece “The Beginnings of ‘Big Business’ in American Industry,” which explored the question of why large, vertically integrated [[corporations]] were formed in the late nineteenth-century and why they took the structure they did. Another highly cited article (240 Google Scholar cites) from 1970 was “The Emerging Organizational Synthesis in American History” by Louis Galambos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Louis Galambos {{!}} Department of History {{!}} Johns Hopkins University|url = http://history.jhu.edu/directory/louis-galambos/|website = history.jhu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also focused on explaining the growth of bureaucratic structures in the United States.

In 1974, ''Business History Review'' published its first special issue on the [[multinational corporation]].  Included in the issue was an article on oil companies operating in South America by Mira Wilkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mira Wilkins|url = http://economics.fiu.edu/people/emeritus-faculty/mira-wilkins/|website = Department of Economics|accessdate = 2015-08-12|first = John|last = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered the field of international business history. The journal also expanded its focus beyond the workings of business enterprise to cover business-government relations.  In 1975, [[Thomas K. McCraw]], who edited the journal from 1994 to 2005, published “Regulation in America: A Review Article.” In 2011, the current editors, Walter A. Friedman and [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)|Geoffrey Jones]] (academic), listed the ''BHR''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s core subjects as innovation, globalization, entrepreneurship, business and the environment, business and government, and business and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Business History: Time for Debate|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0007680511000201|journal = Business History Review|date = 2011-03-01|issn = 2044-768X|pages = 1–8|volume = 85|issue = 01|doi = 10.1017/S0007680511000201|first = Walter A.|last = Friedman|first2 = Geoffrey|last2 = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the journal had an impact factor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Journal Citation Reports - IP &amp; Science - Thomson Reuters|url = http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/analytical/jcr/|website = wokinfo.com|accessdate = 2015-08-12|first = Thomson|last = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; of .625 (with a 5-year impact factor of .895) and was rated as a 4 by the British Academic Journal Guide (a 4* is the highest rating).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Academic Journal Guide 2015 - Chartered Association of Business Schools|url = http://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide-2015/|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business process mapping''' refers to activities involved in defining what a [[business entity]] does, who is responsible, to what standard a [[business process]] should be completed, and how the success of a business process can be determined.

The main purpose behind business process mapping is to assist organizations in becoming more effective. A clear and detailed business process map or diagram allows outside firms to come in and look at whether or not improvements can be made to the current process.

Business process mapping takes a specific objective and helps to measure and compare that objective alongside the entire organization's objectives to make sure that all processes are aligned with the company's values and capabilities.

International Organization for Standardization or [[ISO 9001]] : 2015 encourages a process approach to quality management.   It is important to understand how each process relates to other processes within the organization and how those interactions impact [[Quality Management]].&lt;ref&gt;Dias, S., &amp; Saraiva, P. M. (2004). Use Basic Quality Tools To Manage Your Processes. Quality Progress, 37(8), 47-53. Retrieved from http://sharpthinkers.info/articles/Basic_Tools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Early history===
The first structured method for documenting process flow, the [[flow process chart]], was introduced by [[Frank Gilbreth]] to members of [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] in 1921 as the presentation “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”.  Gilbreth's tools were quickly integrated into [[industrial engineering]] curricula.  In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, [[Allan H. Mogensen]] began training business people by using these tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. A 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, Art Spinanger, took the tools back to [[Procter and Gamble]] where he developed their work simplification program called the Deliberate Methods Change Program.  Another 1944 graduate, [[Benjamin S. Graham|Ben S. Graham]], Director of Formcraft Engineering at [[Standard Register Industrial]], adapted the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart to display multiple documents and their relationships.  In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the ASME Standard for Process Charts.

Business process mapping, also known as process charts, has become much more prevalent and understood in the business world in recent years. Process maps can be used in every section of life or business.
 
The Major Steps of Process Improvement using Process Mapping	
# Process identification - identify objectives, scope, players and work areas. 
# Information gathering - gather process facts (what, who, where, when) from the people who do the work.
# Process Mapping - convert facts into a process map.
# Analysis - work through the map, challenging each step (what-why?, who-why?, where-why?, when-why?, how-why?) 
# Develop/Install New Methods - eliminate unnecessary work, combine steps, rearrange steps, add new steps where necessary
# Manage process - maintain process map in library, review routinely, and monitor process for changes 

Process mapping is capable of supporting several important business goals:

*Business process improvement
*Training
*Process / workflow clarification
*Regulatory compliance
*Internal audit
*Role clarity ([[Responsibility assignment matrix|RACI]])

===Recent developments===
Process mapping has overlapped with software development incorporating tools that can attach metadata to activities, drivers and triggers to provide some automation of software process coding.

Quality improvement practitioners have noted that various graphical descriptions of processes can be useful. These include: detailed flow-charts, work flow diagrams and value stream maps. Each map is helpful depending on the process questions and theories being considered. In these situations process map implies the use of process flow and the current understanding of the causal structure.

[[Six Sigma]] practitioners use the term Business Process Architecture to describe the mapping of business processes as series of cross-functional flowcharts.  Under this school of thought, each flowchart is of a certain level (between 0 and 4) based on the amount of detail the flowchart contains.  A level 0 flowchart represents the least amount of detail, and usually contains one or two steps.  A level 4 flowchart represents the most amount of detail, and can include hundreds of steps.  At this level every task, however minor, is represented.

===Primary example===

[[File:Proposed Patient Appointment Procedure.png|thumb|Proposed Patient Appointment Procedure]]

Flowchart is a primary type of business process mapping. It consists of some symbols such as arrows, circles, diamonds, boxes, ovals, or rectangles. The type of Flowchart just described is sometimes referred to as a "detailed" flowchart because it includes in detail, the inputs, activities, decision points, and outputs of any process.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The example is Proposed Patient Appointment Procedure. It starts with "preparation of appointment book" followed by a decision whether the appointment is shore or fleet. If the appointment is fleet, inform patient they can call 1500 to make own appointments for next few days, if the appointment is shore, confirm 24 hours prior to appointment. Next confirm that the patient confirmed. If a patient did not call, the appointment is canceled, otherwise the patient is given a confirmation number. Finally confirm that the patient showed for the appointment. If not, a standby patient is placed in the appointment slot, the appointment book is marked "Failure" and a failure report is submitted from front desk to fleet liaison. If a patient showed for appointment, put "Patient showed" in appointment book.

===Example===

An easy example to follow is making breakfast:

[[File:Makebreakfast.gif|Making Breakfast Example]]

We must first understand that making breakfast is a process. The ingredients are the inputs and the final breakfast ready to be served is the output. This graph shows the breakdown of each process vertically and horizontally. For instance, cooking ingredients is broken down into all of the different tasks that need to be done: cook bacon, cook eggs, toast bread, and fry potatoes. These tasks are then broken down further below.  In order to cook eggs, one must first heat the pan, pour the mixture, stir mixture, add pepper, and remove eggs. This is a prime example of how process mapping can be used in any situation/process in order to understand all of the different parts so that we can complete the process with a better understanding for more efficiency.
Although this is just a simple example, many aspects of business, including supply chain, operations, marketing, finance, and accounting, use similar process mapping activities to improve efficiency.

'''Business relationship management''' ('''BRM''') is a formal approach to understanding, defining, and supporting inter-business activities related to [[business networking]].

Business relationship management consists of knowledge, skills, and behaviors (or ''competencies'') that foster a productive relationship between a service organization (e.g. [[Human Resources]], [[Information technology]], a finance department, or an external provider) and their business partners.

BRM is distinct from [[enterprise relationship management]] and [[customer relationship management]] although it is related. It is of larger scope than a [[liaison job|liaison]] who aligns business interests with [[Information Technology|IT]] [[deliverable]]s.&lt;ref name="brmit"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://it.toolbox.com/wiki/index.php/Business_Relationship_Manager# |title=Business Relationship Manager |access-date=2009-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317052007/http://it.toolbox.com/wiki/index.php/Business_Relationship_Manager# |archive-date=2010-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends driving BRM development==
Strategic business partners (what used to be referred to as shared services or service providers) require a common methodology to drive true business innovation and strategy. These strategic business partners (IT, Finance, HR, external providers, etc.) are converging with the business. There is one shared business strategy with each business partner accountable for portions of the overall business value achieved.  Business Relationship Management Institute, Inc started promoting this business capability in 2012 with a non-profit membership community dedicated to the BRM profession. 
These features include:
* Business Relationship Management focuses on business value realization through accountable business partners
* advances in the scale, scope, and sophistication of the [[network effect]]
* constant disruption as the 'new normal' business dynamic&lt;ref name="newnormal"&gt;[http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/bigshift/2009/01/the-new-reality-constant-disru.html The New Reality: Constant Disruption]&lt;/ref&gt;
* decentralization of knowledge and the devaluation of traditional [[intellectual property]]&lt;ref name="stocks2flows"&gt;[http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/bigshift/2009/01/abandon-stocks-embrace-flows.html Abandon Stocks, Embrace Flows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="partrev"&gt;[http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail776.html Participation Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;
* increased openness of networked knowledge&lt;ref name="openclosed"&gt;[http://www.opposableplanets.com/future/2009/01/open-beats-closed-four-principles-for-doing-business-in-the-network-economy Open Beats Closed : Four Principles for Doing Business in the Network Economy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ent20"&gt;[http://blog.wirearchy.com/2009/01/07/john-chambers-ceo-of-cisco-at-mit-on-enterprise-20/ John Chambers, CEO of Cisco at MIT, on Enterprise 2.0] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119021036/http://blog.wirearchy.com/2009/01/07/john-chambers-ceo-of-cisco-at-mit-on-enterprise-20/ |date=November 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of these trends on business relationships have driven the foundation of a distinct BRM discipline.

==Overview and goals==

BRM is implemented via organizational roles, a discipline, and an organizational capability.

===As a discipline===
The BRM discipline is research-based and has been verified and enhanced for over a decade. It is used in organizations worldwide and is effective for [[shared services]], external service providers and others. A goal of the discipline is to enable stakeholders to develop, evaluate, and use high-value networking relationships.

===As an organizational role===
The BRM organizational role is a link between a service provider and the business. The role acts as a connector, orchestrator, and navigator between the service provider and one or more business units.

===As a model===
One goal of BRM is to provide a complete model of business relationships and their value over time, in order to make their various aspects both explicit and measurable. A mature BRM model will ultimately support strategic business [[research and development]] efforts as well as tools and techniques that implement BRM principles.

The approach to the BRM modeling process is to identify and describe various aspects of business relationships in terms of:
* defined '''relationship types''', in which each type has a specified '''purpose''', associated '''roles''', and a measurable outcome
* a set of '''processes''' that make up the business relationship '''lifecycles'''
* a set of '''principles''' that apply specifically to these lifecycle processes

[[Asset]]s and products derived from the BRM model are meant to inform and support:
* A practice derived from applying BRM principles, analyzing outcomes, and refining over multiple iterations
* A platform derived from successful practice that further support and optimize BRM as a discipline

The BRM model will identify and categorize business relationships according to type. Each type has a discrete and clear purpose, characterized by a unique combination of roles, functions, and activities, and instances of each type can be identified, quantified, and analyzed. Some examples of these relationship types are business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and business-to-employee.

The BRM model identifies two roles, provider and [[consumer]]; a given business by necessity participates in both roles.

==BRM lifecycles==

The concept of the business relationship lifecycle&lt;ref name="lcvalue"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V69-4H8MP3J-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1d696c2baf837c3c35c8ba21c4559c8e Value creation in the relationship life cycle: A quasi-longitudinal analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lccapture"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V69-49JR23M-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=eabd93bc24a731a47207082c5bccf62e Capturing value creation in business relationships: A customer perspective]&lt;/ref&gt; builds on charting the complex changing values of business relationships over time in contrast to simple [[financial transaction|transactional value]].

Examples of BRM lifecycles include:
* A large-scale grow and sustain cycle, characterized by one-to-many and many-to-one relationships. Activities in this cycle are more or less continuous and overlapping, such as [[marketing]], customer [[product support]] or maintenance, or [[online community]]. These have indeterminate outcomes.
* A small-scale (micro) engagement cycle, characterized by one-to-one, discrete or transactional relationships. These have discrete cycles and negotiated outcomes.

==BRM principles==
;Measurement and analysis
The goals of BRM require that its concepts and principles be identifiable and measurable. Given the model, a person should be able to identify the business relationships that they are engaged in, and measure them in terms like quantity or duration. The same holds for any aspect of BRM, such as type, role, or principle.

;Purpose
Every business relationship has a purpose that requires the participation of multiple roles to accomplish. The purpose of a given business relationship is discrete and quantifiable.

;Reputation and trust
The BRM model should attempt to model and quantify [[reputation]] and [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].

Every relationship, and every interaction within it, contributes to reputation. Reputation mitigates risk and reduces friction within business processes. Concern for reputation incentivizes good behavior.

Absence of trust will cause a business relationship to fail. Trust increases efficiency and enables conflict resolution. The relationship between trust as a traditional core concept&lt;ref name="trustcore"&gt;[http://trustedadvisor.com/cgreen.articles/38/Trust-in-Business-The-Core-Concepts Trust in Business: The Core Concepts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110032155/http://trustedadvisor.com/cgreen.articles/38/Trust-in-Business-The-Core-Concepts |date=November 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in its emerging 'radical' form as a component of online community&lt;ref name="trustrad"&gt;[http://www.radicaltrust.ca/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/radical_trust.pdf Radical Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; must be described.

;Governance
The BRM model needs to account for and align with models of [[corporate governance]], including [[business ethics]], legal constraints, and social norms as they apply to business relationships.

;Boundaries
The BRM model should define the boundaries of business relationships within the larger continuum of interpersonal relationships. In addition to governance issues, the model should examine if there are optimal levels of personal connection, and whether they differ by type, role, or other attribute. The model should help define boundaries that optimize effectiveness while supporting good governance practices.

;Exchange and reciprocity
The BRM model of exchange and [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] must extend traditional dimensions to account for not only financial exchange, but also time, money, knowledge, and reputation exchanges. These are a key feature of business relationships.

==Business Relationship Management Institute (BRMI)==
In 2013, the Business Relationship Management Institute (BRMI) was founded, which publishes a guide that offers a "comprehensive foundation-level overview of the art and practice of Business Relationship Management." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The BRMP® Guide to the BRM Body of Knowledge. | ISBN = 978-9401800228 |year = 2014 |publisher = Van Haren Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRMI offers a Business Relationship Management Professional (BRMP) designation, as well as a Certified Business Relationship Manager (CBRM) designation. These are globally accredited and administered by their partner, APMG-International.

'''CTQ trees''' ([[critical-to-quality]] trees) are the key measurable characteristics of a product or process whose performance standards or specification limits must be met in order to satisfy the customer. They align improvement or design efforts with customer requirements.

CTQs are used to decompose broad [[customer]] [[requirement]]s into more easily quantified elements. CTQ trees are often used as part of [[six sigma]] methodology to help prioritize such requirements. 

CTQs represent the product or service characteristics as defined by the customer/user. Customers may be surveyed to elicit quality, service and performance data. They may include upper and lower specification limits or any other factors. A CTQ must be an actionable, quantitative business specification.

CTQs reflect the expressed needs of the customer. The CTQ practitioner converts them to measurable terms using tools such as [[DFMEA]]. Services and products are typically not monolithic. They must be decomposed into constituent elements (tasks in the cases of services).

The term '''citizen enterprise''' started to be used in the United States in 2008 to describe businesses that practice [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR).

==Information==
In some countries, such as Papua New Guinea, the term is used to describe companies owned by citizens of that country, rather than by foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipa.gov.pg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=128 The Papua New Guinea Investment Promotion Agency - Citizen, National and Foreign Enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be confused with [[social enterprise]], which is a more complex notion involving origin, ownership and participation as well as objectives, activities and the use of profits.

'''Cost estimation models''' are mathematical [[algorithm]]s or [[parametric equations]] used to estimate the costs of a product or project.  The results of the models are typically necessary to obtain approval to proceed, and are factored into business plans, budgets, and other financial planning and tracking mechanisms.

These algorithms were originally performed manually but now are almost universally computerized.  They may be standardized (available in published texts or purchased commercially) or proprietary, depending on the type of business, product, or project in question.  Simple models may use standard [[spreadsheet]] products.

Models typically function through the input of [[parameter]]s that describe the attributes of the product or project in question, and possibly physical resource requirements.  The model then provides as output various resources requirements in cost and time. Some models concentrate only on estimating project costs (often a single monetary value). Little attention has been given to the development of models for estimating the amount of resources needed for the different elements that comprise a project.&lt;ref&gt;García de Soto Lastra, B. (2014). A methodology to make accurate preliminary estimates of construction material quantities for construction projects (Doctoral dissertation). Diss. ETH No. 22313, Zurich, Switzerland. https://dx.doi.org/10.3929/ethz-a-010361720&lt;/ref&gt;

Other models are used to calculate costs of equipment, which provides more accuracy than models on a project level. Usage of these models is dependent on required accuracy and the phase of the project and its estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.costmanagement.eu/blog-article/5-costs-estimation-techniques-of-cleopatra-enterprise-software|title=5 costs estimation techniques of Cleopatra Enterprise software|website=www.costmanagement.eu|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost modeling practitioners often have the titles of cost estimators, [[cost engineer]]s, or parametric analysts.

Typical applications include:
*[[Construction]]
*[[Software Development]]
*[[Manufacturing]]
*[[New product development]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1988">'''Court auction''' is an auction which takes place at a public location designated by the court.

If a property owner fails to pay the mortgage, the mortgage holder can [[Foreclosure|foreclose]] on that property. If the owner is unable to make sufficient payments, the property can be sold at auction. The time and place of the auction is published in official records.

In case the value of the debt being foreclosed on is substantially less than the market value of the real property, this can finish the trouble for the debitor by paying all the credits.

== Germany ==

In [[Germany]] the court may suspend the auction for 6 months on the debtor's justified request. Justification may be hardship, e.g. if debtor has a physical disability and cannot find adequate housing. The creditor can object up to twice if the result of the auction is not sufficient to fulfil the claim. The bidder must deposit security in the amount of 10%. The highest bidder becomes the owner of the real property. If the claim is greater than the market value of the real property, debts are handled in an [[insolvency]] proceeding.

== Spain ==

Spanish mortgage holders are responsible for the full amount of the loan to the bank in addition to penalty interest charges, and court fees.

== United States ==

Historically, the vast majority of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money with which to hire counsel. The highest bidder at the auction becomes the owner of the real property, free and clear of interest of the former owner. In 2009 there was a growing consensus that the deepening collapse of the housing market was at the heart of the country’s acute economic downturn. The rules for court auction differ in the states.

[[File:Customs-House-Brisbane-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Customs House in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''custom house''' or '''customs house''' was a building housing the offices for the government officials who processed the paperwork associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country.  Customs officials also collected [[customs (tax)|customs duty]] on imported goods.

The custom house was typically located in a [[seaport]] or in a city on a major river, with access to the ocean.  These cities acted as a [[port of entry]] into a country.  The government stationed officials at such locations to collect taxes and regulate commerce.

Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term "custom house" is now often an historical anachronism.  There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings.

In the [[United Kingdom]], since 1386, the phrase ''custom house'' has been in use over the term ''customs house''.  This was after a "[[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]]" was erected at Wool Wharf in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Ward]], to contain just the officials of the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.  The singular form was used even though in later years the Custom House was the location of other Customs officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Graham |date=1980|title=Something To Declare|page=6|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co.

'''Editorial-related advertising''' is associated with the concept of [[contextual advertising]] but differs in its ability to match [[advertising]] to content in a much more specific manner. Where contextual advertising is keyword based, editorial-related advertising is able to also take in the content of the whole article and match on a conceptual level, rather than simply looking for the existence of pre-selected words. For example, there is no chance that an auto mechanic could advertise next to an article about the [[Detroit Pistons]]. It has many different ways to go and one would be to not.

This specificity also ensures that:
* Advertisers do not advertise next to [[defamatory]] articles (or they can create content that will offer a [[right of reply]])
* Advertisers do not advertise next to inappropriate content such as [[obituaries]] or negative news articles
* Advertisers can appear next to articles in the general subject area of interest, for example for keywords that are not actually included in the on page text.

Advertisers can supply a number of specifically targeted pages, each with their own message to attract users to their '[[microsite]]'. This 'microsite' is housed within a publication on a searchable vertical directory. Advertisers who are not completely related to the publication will not be considered for the program. This creates a directory resource of related suppliers within the publication's website that is also [[search engine optimization|optimized]] for [[search engine]] traffic.

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

'''Consulting''' by [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty members]] is the use of [[scholarly]] expertise for the benefit of organizations outside the scholarly community through [[friendship]], [[volunteering]] or in return for some sort of compensation.

[[Universities]] have widely varying [[policies]] on faculty consulting, generally limiting the proportion of a faculty member's time, which may be spent on consulting, and instituting rules to avoid [[conflicts of interest]].

Consulting is distinguished from activities, which are scholarly or [[creativity|creative]], from [[public service]], and from outside activities which are unrelated to the area of scholarly expertise.  For instance, a professor of [[history]] who designs [[sailboats]] on the side is not considered to be consulting, although a professor of [[engineering]] might be.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">'''Foresight''' is the ability to predict, or the action of predicting, what will happen or what is needed in the future. Studies suggest that much of [[human]] daily thought is directed towards potential future events. Because of this and its role in human control on the planet, the nature and evolution of foresight is an important topic in [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Suddendorf &amp; [[Michael Corballis|Corballis]] (2007). "The evolution of foresight: What is mental time travel and is it uniquely human". ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'', 30, 299-313.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]], [[Developmental psychology|developmental]], and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] studies have identified many commonalities to the human ability to recall past [[Episodic memory|episodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Addis DR, Wong AT, Schacter DL. "Remembering the Past and Imagining the Future: Common and Distinct Neural Substrates During Event Construction and Elaboration". ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' 2007; 45:1363-1377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hassabis D, Kumaran D, Vann SD, Maguire EA. "Patients with Hippocampal Amnesia Cannot Imagine New Experiences". ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' 2007; 104:1726-1731.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine selected new evidence for such commonalities one of the top ten scientific breakthroughs of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date= 21 December 2007|title= BREAKTHROUGH OF THE YEAR: The Runners-Up|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5858/1844.1.full|journal= Science|publisher= American Academy for the Advancement of Science|volume= 318|issue= 5848|pages= 1844-1849 |doi= 10.1126/science.318.5858.1844a |accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are fundamental differences between mentally travelling through time into the future (i.e., foresight) versus mentally travelling through time into the past (i.e., episodic memory).&lt;ref&gt;Suddendorf T. "Episodic Memory Versus Episodic Foresight: Similarities and Differences". ''Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science'', 1, 99-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In management ==
Foresight has been classified as a [[behaviour]] (covert and/or overt) in management, a review, [[analysis]], and [[:wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of past definitions and usages of the foresight concept into a generic definition, in order to make the concept measurable.&lt;ref name="Amsteus"&gt;Amsteus, M. (2008) "Managerial foresight: concept and measurement". ''Foresight: the journal for future studies, strategic thinking and policy'', Vol. 10 No. 1, pp. 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spe
"Degree of analyzing present contingencies and degree of moving the analysis of present contingencies across time, and degree of analyzing a desired future state or states a degree ahead in time with regard to contingencies under control, as well as degree of analyzing courses of action a degree ahead in time to arrive at the desired future state."&lt;ref name="Amsteus"/&gt;

[[Prediction market]] are exchange-traded markets created for the purpose of trading the outcome of events. This economic theory is credited to economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Prediction Market gives the ability  to aggregate information and make accurate predictions based on the [[Efficient-market hypothesis|Efficient Market Hypothesis]], which states that assets prices are fully reflecting all available information. For instance, existing share prices always include all the relevant related information for the stock market to make accurate predictions.

The '''Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank''' (Hungarian: '''Magyar Ipar-és Kereskedelmi Bank''') was an important Hungarian bank in the late 19th and early 20th century.

It was a mediocre bank until the appointment of [[István Tisza]] - a prominent businessman and politician - as its president. Under his direction, it became the largest bank of Hungary within a decade.

'''''Inc.''''' is an American weekly [[magazine]] which publishes about small businesses and [[Startup company|startup]]s. The magazine publishes annual lists of the 500 and 5000 fastest-growing privately held small companies in the U.S., called the "Inc. 500" and "Inc. 5000". It was founded in 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Todd A.

==History==
''Inc.'' was founded in [[Boston]] by [[Bernie Goldhirsh]], and its first issue appeared in April 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrepreneurship Education Chronology|url=http://www.slu.edu/eweb/connect/for-faculty/infrastructure/entrepreneurship-education-chronology|work=Saint Louis University|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldhirsh was an [[MIT]]-trained engineer who worked at [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] and on [[ballistic missile]]s before becoming an entrepreneur and founding ''Sail'' magazine, which he sold for $10 million, using the profits to found ''Inc.'' Paul W. Kellam, who had joined Goldhirsh's company as editor of ''Marine Business'', was tapped as the first editor.&lt;ref name="McGray"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/magazine/west/la-tm-goldhirsh30jul23,0,3430054.story?coll=la-home-magazine |title=Do the Right Thing |author=Douglas McGray |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 23, 2006 |accessdate=February 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313042751/http://www.latimes.com/features/magazine/west/la-tm-goldhirsh30jul23%2C0%2C3430054.story?coll=la-home-magazine |archivedate=March 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldhirsh kept a low profile, and longtime editor George Gendron was the "public face" of the magazine for two decades.&lt;ref name="BBF"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bizforward.com/bos/issues/2001-08/reversal/|title=Reversal of Misfortune|author=Ellen O'Brien|work=Boston Business Forward|date=August 2001|accessdate=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though long considered the younger upstart compared to most business publications, ''Inc.'' suffered following the [[dot-com era]] as titles like ''[[Fast Company magazine|Fast Company]]'' seemed to grab more attention, but the tech crash and subsequent retrenchment saw the magazine stabilize its circulation and image.&lt;ref name="BBF"/&gt; In 2000, widowed and battling [[cancer]], Goldhirsh sold the magazine to [[Gruner + Jahr]]&lt;ref name="BBF"/&gt; for a reported price of over $200 million.&lt;ref name="McGray"/&gt; The magazine was purchased in 2005 by [[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]] founder, [[Joe Mansueto]], and ''Inc.'' and its sister magazine ''[[Fast Company magazine|Fast Company]]'' constitute the publishing arm of [[Mansueto Ventures]]. 

The magazine is based in [[New York City]], and its editor-in-chief is [[Eric Schurenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/editor-out-inc-139427/|title=Editor Out at 'Inc.'|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, Schurenberg was appointed as President of ''Inc.'', replacing the long-tenured Bob LaPointe. In late January 2014, ''Inc.'' announced that Reuters opinion editor, [[James Ledbetter|James Ledbetter,]] would take over as editor of the magazine and web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://observer.com/2014/10/inc-ledbetter/|title=Inc.

In October 1981, ''Inc.'' became the first magazine to feature [[Steve Jobs]] on its cover, alongside the proclamation, "This man has changed business forever."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Isaacson]], ''[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2011, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inc.'' produces the radio show ''Inc. Radio'' in association with [[Entertainment Radio Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ernlive.com/show/inc-radio/15335 Inc.

==Inc. 500 and Inc. 5000==
The Inc. 500 is an annual list of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the United States, introduced in 1982. The Inc. 5000 is an expansion of the Inc. 500, which ranks the country’s top 5000 fastest-growing private companies and also features a special ranking of the top 10% of the list as the Inc. 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secure.lenos.com/lenos/inc/Inc500WashingtonDC/about.asp|title=Inc500WashingtonDC: about|work=Secure.lenos.com|accessdate=September 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826232403/http://secure.lenos.com/lenos/inc/Inc500WashingtonDC/about.asp|archivedate=August 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inc. 5000 is ranked according to percentage revenue growth over a three-year period. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by the first week of the starting calendar year, and therefore able to show three full calendar years of sales. Additionally, they had to be U.S.-based, privately held, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31 of the last year measured. Revenue in the initial year must have been at least $100,000, and revenue in the most recent year must have been at least $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/inc5000apply/faqs.html?CID=so13023ld |title=Inc. 5,000 FAQ Article |work=Inc.|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first issue in 1979, ''Inc.'' magazine published the Inc. 100, a list of the fastest-growing publicly held small companies; in 1982, the list was expanded to become the Inc. 500, and in 2007, it was expanded again to become the Inc. 5000.

The Inc. 500 | 5000 Conference and Awards Ceremony is an annual event that promotes the list publication. The event also offers workshops and lectures by key speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/08/22/1091060/0/en/Inc-Magazine-Unveils-36th-Annual-List-of-America-s-Fastest-Growing-Private-Companies-the-Inc-5000.html|title=Inc.

This annual conference brings together the current year's class of Inc. 500 | 5000 honorees, the list's alumni, as well as entrepreneurs from the general public.  The event has featured a number of well-known business and political figures and expert speakers including: [[Bill Clinton]], [[Bob Berry (businessman)|Bob Berry]], [[Marshall Goldsmith]], [[Scott Cook]], [[Bernard Marcus]], and [[Thomas Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secure.lenos.com/lenos/inc/Inc500WashingtonDC/about.asp|title=M.Day, About Inc.500/Inc. 5,000 Conference and Awards Ceremony|publisher=Secure.lenos.com|accessdate=September 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826232403/http://secure.lenos.com/lenos/inc/Inc500WashingtonDC/about.asp|archivedate=August 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2006/08/21/daily35.html |title=Seventeen Arizona firms make Inc. 500 |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= August 23, 2006|accessdate=September 10, 2011 |first=Angela |last=Gonzales}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,251479,00.html |title=Tamara Schweitzer, Study: Inc. 500 Companies Fast Adopters of Social Media |publisher=Fox News |date=February 12, 2007 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530083812/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C251479%2C00.html |archivedate=May 30, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">An '''information silo''', or a group of such silos, is an insular [[management system]] in which one [[information system]] or subsystem is incapable of reciprocal operation with others that are, or should be, related. Thus [[information]] is not adequately shared but rather remains sequestered within each system or subsystem, figuratively trapped within a container like grain is trapped within a [[silo]]: there may be a lot of it, and it may be stacked quite high and freely available within those limits, but it has no effect outside those limits. Such data silos are proving to be an obstacle for businesses wishing to use [[data mining]] to make productive use of their data. 

[[File:Information silo.png|thumb|Typical information silos in a hierarchic structured organization.]]
Information silos occur whenever a [[data system]] is incompatible or not integrated with other data systems.  This incompatibility may occur in the technical architecture, in the [[application architecture]], or in the [[data architecture]] of any data system.  However, since it has been shown that established [[data modeling]] methods are the root cause of the data integration problem &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://maxxphase.com/data-compatibility/top-benefits/data-silo-elimination/|title = Incompatible Data Silos|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, most data systems are at least incompatible in the data architecture layer.

==Silo mentality==
In management the term '''silo mentality''' often refers to information silos in organizations. Silo mentality is caused by divergent goals of different organizational units. It can also be described as a variant of the [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent problem]]. Silo mentality preferably occurs in larger organizations and can lead to a decreased performance and has a negative impact on the corporate culture. Silo mentality can be countered by the introduction of shared goals, the increase of internal networking activities and the flattening of hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.rotize.com/silo-mentality/|title = Silo mentality in companies|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Predictors for the occurrence of silos are 
* Number of employees 
* Number of organizational units within the whole organization 
* Degree of specialization 
* Number of different incentive mechanisms  

This should not be confused with a data silo in computing, like [[application virtualization]], [[operating-system-level virtualization]], or a [[separation kernel]].

== Etymology ==
The term '''functional silo syndrome''' was coined in 1988 by Phil S. Ensor (1931–2018) who worked in organizational development and employee relations for [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]], [[Eaton Corporation]], and as a consultant. "Silo" and "stovepipe" (as in "[[stovepipe (organisation)|stovepipe organization]]" and "[[stovepipe system]]") are now used interchangeably and applied broadly. Phil Ensor's use of the term "silo" reflects his rural Illinois origins and the many grain silos he would pass on return visits as he contemplated the challenges of the modern organizations with which he worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Functional Silo Syndrome|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/documents/88q1a3.pdf|first=Phil|last=Ensor|work=AME Target|page=16|date=Spring 1988|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Organizational Renewal – Tearing Down the Functional Silos|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/target_articles/88q2a1.pdf|author=AME Study Group on Functional Organization|work=AME Target|page=4-16|date=Summer 1988|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Breaking Down the Functional Silos: Motorola Paging Division "Bandit" Plant|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/documents/89Q4A5.pdf|first=James|last=Pullin|work=AME Target|date=Winter 1989|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Of Silos and Stovepipes|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002964.html|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|work=Language Log|date=2006-03-27|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Internet booking engine''' (IBE) is a website that allows consumers and [[travel agent]]s to book flights, hotels, holiday packages, insurance and other services online. 

== History ==
In the early days of American aviation, passengers were very few and the airlines did not fly regularly as at present. Ticket fares were regulated by the [[United States government role in civil aviation|Civil Aeronautics Board]]. All routes, fares and flight schedules were published in the [[Official Airline Guide]] and travel agents requested reservations by phone or [[telex]]. As the number of passengers flying annually began to grow, this manual system could not cope and the airlines looked at upgrading their method of ticketing.

In 1946 [[American Airlines]] were the very first to come out with an automated booking system. This was called the [[Reservisor|Electromechanical Reservisor]] which comprised a temporary storage of [[Drum memory|magnetic drums]]. The airline’s operators had to do the actual lookups as travel agents could not directly query this system.
 
1953 marked the birth of complex airline reservation systems when American Airlines launched the [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE]] ([[Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment]]) reservation system. Next came DATAS by [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], Apollo by [[United Airlines]] and [[Programmed Airline Reservation System|PARS]] by [[Trans World Airlines]]. Eventually these were replaced{{fact|date=August 2016}} by complex [[computer reservations system]]s (CRSs). Originally operated by airlines, CRSs were later extended for the use of travel agents who could query the systems and make reservations themselves.
 
In the early 1980s CRSs were extended with more features and the new systems were able to book and sell tickets for multiple airlines where the earlier CRSs could handle only one. These newly developed systems were called [[global distribution system]]s (GDS). Eventually airlines divested their direct holdings in GDS companies, with the notable exception of the Asian carriers who remain owners of the following GDSs: Abacus, Topas, Axess, Infini and Travelsky. In addition [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]] has [[Air France-KLM|Air France/ KLM]], [[Lufthansa]] and [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] as minority shareholders.

Through a GDS, travel agents could easily retrieve the information needed about many airlines. They had greater information-searching and booking capabilities.

Yet passengers themselves needed a travel agent’s assistance when making a booking. If any passenger wanted to book a seat or to go through a schedule they would have to contact the travel agents. So the airlines needed a web-based booking system which will allow the passengers to directly retrieve information about the air schedules, make booking etc. That is when the Internet booking engines (IBEs) were introduced. IBEs are used by nearly every airline at present to cut off extra expenses and to support instant booking and payment.

== Overview ==
An internet booking engine allows a customer to specify their travel requirements such as city of departure, destination, departure date, return date and class of travel. Once this information is received, the IBE will offer a list of available air tickets, hotels and excursions which the customer can then book.

The real value of an IBE is in the [[business rules]] and processes that package the content and provide the capability to shop and purchase. This includes packaging and pricing rules, customized displays for different customers and channels, business rules, and check out and payment processes.

===How it works===
An IBE is installed on the home page of an airline to enable easy access for customers. When shoppers enter their travel preferences the IBE contacts the GDS or CRS/HRS ([[computer reservations system]]) to receive the relevant information which is then shown to the user in an appropriate interface.

The flights and fares may differ according to type of customer accessing the IBE. For example, corporate members or frequent flyers may have access to discounted fares or will enjoy privileges such as redemption of loyalty points against the airfare.

With the Super [[Passenger Name Record]] (Super PNR) function an IBE offers the capability of booking non-air elements such as hotels, cars, holidays and insurance.

After the customer has finished selecting their flights they must choose a payment method. There are several options to choose from; credit card payment, redeeming [[frequent flyer program]] (FFP) points or miles in exchange for a flight ticket, discount vouchers as well as alternative payment methods such as PayPal or direct transfers from a customer's bank account - the number of options mostly depending on the point-of-sale country. If a customer prefers to pay in cash they will need to visit an [[airline]] office to complete the purchase. Once the customer has completed the payment process, a [[Passenger Name Record]] (PNR) is created in the airline's reservation systems and an [[e-ticket]] will be issued.  

As the IBE is an online booking system the interface is often in [[HTML]]. With the growth of broadband, technologies such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] or [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] are now used to support the change of the user’s interactivity.

An IBE has real time connectivity to a credit card clearance agency as most payments are made through credit card. Some IBEs offer multi-lingual and multi-currency support for customer convenience.

A good security system which supports authentication and authorization is a must for an IBE.

== Recent developments ==

IBE providers keep adding new features to internet booking engines such as multiple search options so that a customer can book the flight in a manner that suits his/her requirements. If the customer is “schedule sensitive” or needs to adhere to specific travel dates, the IBE offers ticket fares giving priority to the travel calendar. Some IBEs also support passengers who desire to have multiple stops on their way to their destination. As many passengers are very concerned about the ticket price, the IBE of an airline shows a comparison between the low and high ticket fares, with the services included in each.

A user may be able to access a seat map and reserve a preferred seat which is available. The selection of a front row, aisle seat, or window seat is possible. This feature, which is known as web check-in, allows a passenger to check-in online and print their own boarding pass.

Carbon offset programs are also a new feature offered through IBEs. Here, a passenger can contribute to the airline’s environmental initiatives by making a special donation at the time of booking a ticket.

There are also IBE providers who now focus solely on the Vacation Condo, Vacation Villa and Vacation Apartment rental industries along with IBE providers who focus on smaller boutique and independent family owned motel and hotels.

More recently, the leisure, tour and activity market has been digitalized by IBE providers focussing solely on this segment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tnooz.com/article/regiondo-takes-multi-million-funding-round-from-german-dragon/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet booking engine websites==
Online travel bookings will represent almost a third of worldwide volume by the end of 2012, according to yStats.com "Global Online Travel Report 2012" report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Travel Report 2012|url= http://www.newmediatrendwatch.com/world-overview/91-online-travel-market?start=1|year=2012|publisher=yStats.com|accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the growth of online travel booking has come from the development of travel websites that allow booking of flights, hotels, and car rentals. In the past 15 years, there has been a significant shift towards more online booking. This shift started with the creation of internet booking engine websites which search across multiple independent travel sites &amp; booking engines.

'''Legal Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance or "LGRC"''', refers to the complex set of processes, rules, tools and systems used by corporate legal departments to adopt, implement and monitor an integrated approach to business problems.
While [[Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance]] refers to a generalized set of tools for managing a corporation or company, Legal GRC, or LGRC, refers to a specialized – but similar – set of [http://ro.ecu.edu.au/adf/171/ tools]&lt;ref&gt;Adams, R., Mann, G., &amp; Hobbs, V. (2017). ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition''. Paper presented in Valli, C. (Ed.).'' ''The Proceedings of 15th Australian Digital Forensics Conference 5-6 December 2017, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia''&lt;/ref&gt; utilized by attorneys, corporate legal departments, general counsel and law firms to govern themselves and their corporations, especially but not exclusively in relation to the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/techexec/2007/0507techexec1.html Musthaler, Linda and Brian. Governance, risk management and compliance and what it means to you. Network World, March 7, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other specializations within the realm of governance, risk management and compliance include IT GRC and financial GRC. Within these three realms, there is a great deal of overlap, particularly in large corporations that have legal and IT departments, as well as financial departments.

==Legal governance==

'''Legal governance''' refers to the establishment, execution and interpretation of processes and rules put in place by corporate legal departments in order to ensure a smoothly-run legal department and corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dciginc.com/2008/01/interview-with-stephen-whetstone-pt1.html Konkle, Joshua L. Legal risk management requires a corporate strategy, mindset and commitment. DCIG,January 9, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal risk management==

'''Legal risk management''' refers to the process of evaluating alternative regulatory and non-regulatory responses to risk and selecting among them. Even with the legal realm, this process requires knowledge of the legal, economic and social factors, as well as knowledge of the business world in which legal teams operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/factsheet/gloss.htm US Army Corps of Engineers Glossary. August 1998.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120132402/http://www.fusrapmaywood.com/factsheet/gloss.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an organizational setting, risk management refers to the process by which an organization sets the risk tolerance, identifies potential risks and prioritizes the tolerance for risk based on the organization’s business objectives, and manages and mitigates risks throughout the organization.

==Legal compliance==

'''Legal compliance''' is the process or procedure to ensure that an organization follows relevant laws, regulations and business rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmsbvi.k12.nm.us/Records/records_def.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205103206/http://www.nmsbvi.k12.nm.us/Records/records_def.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of legal compliance, especially in the context of corporate legal departments, has recently been expanded to include understanding and adhering to ethical codes within entire professions, as well. There are two requirements for an enterprise to be compliant with the law, first its policies need to be consistent with the law.  Second, its policies need to be complete with respect to the law.
The role of legal compliance has also been expanded to include self-monitoring the non-governed behavior with industries and corporations that could lead to workplace indiscretions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4153/is_3_61/ai_n6153200 Bauer, Christopher. An ethics self-exam: ethical compliances is not just an issue for external review; auditors must look inward to ensure their own integrity is not compromised. Bnet, June 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218141809/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4153/is_3_61/ai_n6153200 |date=2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the LGRC realm, it is important to keep in mind that if a strong legal governance component is in place, risk can be accurately assessed and the monitoring of legal compliance be carried out efficiently. It is also important to realize that within the LGRC framework, legal teams work closely with executive teams and other business departments to align their goals and ensure proper communication.

===Legal Consistency===

'''Legal Consistency''' is a property that declares enterprise policies to be free of contradictions with the law. '''Legal Consistency'''  has been defined as not having multiple verdicts for the same case  &lt;ref&gt;International Law and International Relations: An International  Organization Reader. By Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Contributor Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Edition: illustrated Published by Cambridge University Press, 
2007. {{ISBN|0-521-86186-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-86186-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. The antonym '''Legal Inconsistency'''  is defined as having two rule that contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;Legisprudence: A New Theoretical Approach to Legislation : Proceedings of the Fourth Benelux-Scandinavian Symposium on Legal Theory By Luc Wintgens Contributor Luc Wintgens Edition: illustrated Published by Hart Publishing, 1998 {{ISBN|1-84113-342-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84113-342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common definitions of consistency refer to “treating  similar cases alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Law and justice in the courts of classical Athens By Adriaan Lanni Published by Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-85759-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-85759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the enterprise context, legal consistency  refers to “obedience to the law”.&lt;ref&gt;The Measurement of Moral Judgment By Anne Colby, Lawrence Kohlberg Contributor Lawrence Kohlberg Edition: illustrated Published by CUP Archive, 1987 {{ISBN|0-521-32501-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-32501-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of legal requirements validation, legal consistency is defined as, " Enterprise requirements are legally consistent if they adhere to the legal requirements and include no contradictions."&lt;ref name="WaelHassan"&gt;Hassan, Waël. PhD Thesis.  University of Ottawa. University of Ottawa Press. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Completeness===

'''Legal Completeness''' is a property that declares enterprise policies to cover all scenarios included or suggested by the law. Completeness suggests that there are no scenarios covered by the law that cannot be implemented in the enterprise.  In addition, it implies that all scenarios not allowed by the law are not allowed by the enterprise.

Enterprise policies are said to be legally complete if they contain no gaps in the legal sense. Completeness can be thought of in two ways:&lt;ref&gt;Armour, J. Share Capital and Creditor Protection: Efficient Rules for a 
Modern Company Law. ESRC Centre for Business Research - Working Papers wp148, ESRC Centre for Business Research. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars make use of a concept of ‘obligational’ completeness such as Ayres and Gertner.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, Ian and Gertner, Robert (1992), ‘Strategic Contractual Inefficiency and the Optimal Choice of Legal Rules’, 101 Yale Law Journal 729&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to this usage, a system or a contract is ‘obligationally’ complete if it specifies what each party is to do in every situation, even if this is not the optimal action to take under some circumstances. Others discuss ‘enforceability’ completeness in the sense that failing to specify key terms can lead a court to characterize a system as being too uncertain to enforce (May &amp; Butcher v the King 1934),&lt;ref&gt;Cases and Materials on Contracts By S. M. Waddams, Waddams, S. M., 1942-, Waddams, Trebilcock, mccamus, Neyers, Waldron Edition: 3 Published by Emond  Montgomery Publication, 2005 {{ISBN|1-55239-166-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55239-166-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence a system may be complete with respect to enforceability. This leads to the following definition: enterprise regulations or requirements are legally complete if it specifies what each party is to do in each situation while covering all gaps in the legal sense.&lt;ref name="WaelHassan" /&gt;

==History==

Lebogang says.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110530070924/http://220.72.21.21/pub/docu/kr/AA/04/AA042007SAF/AA04-2007-SAF-001.PDF Kim, Won-Kyu. The effect of industrial restructuring policy post-financial crisis. September/October 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] act, legal industry [[thought leaders]] saw a need for a new framework for legal GRC, and borrowed heavily from IT, RIM and other industries to try to come up with new, clear processes and rules to make navigating the choppy waters of the post-financial crisis legal world go as smoothly as possible.

==Organizations==

===Legal GRC Center for Innovation===

The Legal GRC Center for Innovation is a nonprofit institute for the advancement of the concepts and applications of Legal GRC. The LGRC Center for Innovation serves as a forum for legal industry leaders to discuss and determine ways to systematize and streamline within the legal industry. The membership of the LGRC-CFI is made up of a group of [thought leaders] in the legal, business, IT, and RIM fields. They meet in online forums and at periodic conventions and summits to determine [[best practices]] for Legal GRC. The LGRC-CFI also publishes a [[blog]] and several industry-specific [[white papers]] regularly. The LGRC Center for Innovation addresses legal governance, risk management, and compliance exclusively.

===Institute on Governance===

The [[Institute on Governance]] (IOG), although it does not address LGRC exclusively, is a useful resource for knowledge on governance in general, and has collected some significant basics about legal governance online.
The IOG is an independent, Canadian, nonprofit [think tank] founded in 1990 to promote better governance for public benefit. Through our research and services we help public organizations and societies realize their objectives by putting [[good governance]] into practice.

===Association of Corporate Counsel===

The [[Association of Corporate Counsel]] ("ACC"), formerly the American Corporate Counsel Association ("ACCA"), is an association of in-house counsel, [[Lawyer|attorneys]] who work for [[corporations]]. The association publishes the magazine ACC Docket and arranges one of the United States’ largest annual meetings for in-house attorneys. ACC was founded in 1982. It currently has more than 24,000 members from over 10,500 corporations in 77 countries.[1]
The ACC does not address LGRC exclusively, but can be credited with laying some foundations for corporations – the original practitioners of governance, risk management, and compliance – and legal departments to begin to work together on overarching issues of governance, risk management, and compliance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

{{notability|date=January 2014}}

'''Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA)''' is a tool to determine the most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] option among different competing alternatives to purchase, own, operate, maintain and, finally, dispose of an object or process, when each is equally appropriate to be implemented on technical grounds. For example, for a highway pavement, in addition to the initial construction cost, LCCA takes into account all the user costs, (e.g., reduced capacity at work zones), and agency costs related to future activities, including future periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. All the costs are usually discounted and total to a present-day value known as [[net present value]] (NPV). This example can be generalized on any type of material, product, or system.

In order to perform an LCCA scoping is critical - what aspects are to be included and what not?  If the scope becomes too large the tool may become impractical to use and of limited ability to help in decision-making and consideration of alternatives; if the scope is too small then the results may be skewed by the choice of factors considered such that the output becomes unreliable or partisan.  Usually, the LCCA term implies that environmental costs are not included, whereas the similar [[Whole-life cost|Whole-Life Costing]], or just [[Life Cycle Analysis]] (LCA), generally has a broader scope, including [[environmental costs]].
 
To help building and facility managers make sound decisions, the US [[Federal Energy Management Program]] (FEMP) provides guidance and resources on applying LCCA that permits the cost-effectiveness of [[Efficient energy use|energy]] and [[water efficiency]] investments to be evaluated (see [https://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=907459 NIST Handbook 135]).  This document includes an introduction to LCCA.

Life cycle cost can be conducted in two approaches: deterministic and probabilistic method.

'''Managerial psychology''' is a sub-discipline of industrial and organizational [[psychology]], which focuses on the efficacy of individuals, groups and organizations in the [[workplace]]. Its purpose is to specifically aid [[Management|managers]] in gaining a better understanding of the psychological patterns common among individuals and groups within any given organisation. Managerial psychology can be used to predict and prevent harmful psychological patterns within the workplace and can also be implemented to control psychological patterns among individuals and groups in a way that will benefit the organisation long term. (Robbins, SP et al.2010).

== Managerial psychologists ==
If in the early stages managerial psychologists used to study the problems of fatigue, boredom, and other working conditions that could impede efficient work performance. More recently, their contributions have expanded to include [[learning]], [[perception]], [[personality]], [[emotion]]s, training, leadership, effectiveness, needs and motivational forces, job satisfaction, decision-making processes, performance appraisals, attitude measurement, employee-selection techniques, work design, and job stress(Robbins, SP et al.2010). This means that they apply psychology principles to the workplace and use their skills to study workplace productivity, morale, employee screening or organizational development. Apart from this, they can also train and screen job applicants, assist with organizational development, and consult with corporations on a problem-solving basis.

== Objectives ==
* To understand how to manage stress, change and personal problems
* To understand how to work with a diverse group of people
* To understand how to conduct conflict resolution and the importance of effective confrontation skills
* To understand the importance of ethics in the workplace
* To identify effective leadership styles and the importance of leadership and what makes someone a successful leader
* To learn how to identify skills, motivate, develop and persuade others.

== Personality, motivation and job satisfaction ==
Herzberg et al.’s (1959) seminal [[Two-factor theory|two-factor theory of motivation]] theorized that satisfaction and dissatisfaction were not two opposite extremes of the same sequence, but two separate entities caused by quite different facets of work – these were labelled as “hygiene factors” and “motivators”. Hygiene factors are characterized as extrinsic components of job design that contribute to employee dissatisfaction if they are not met. Examples include: supervision, working conditions, company policies, salary, and relations with co-workers. Motivators, however, are intrinsic to the job itself and include aspects such as achievement, development, responsibility and recognition. On the other hand, intrinsic factors have long been acknowledged as important determinants of motivation. There is a longstanding debate as to whether hygiene factors really contribute to job satisfaction (Furnham et al., 1999; Warr, 1987). Most job satisfaction and motivation research literature is concerned with organisational or situational predictors (such as pay and supervision) (Locke, 1976) while neglecting individual differences (Staw and Ross, 1985). O’Reilly et al. (1980) discovered that individuals’ significantly differ in the way they perceive their jobs, even if the job description and the tasks they had to perform remained constant, thus suggesting that some individual differences must have an effect on work attitudes.

Staw et al. (1986) argued that individual disposition may have a profound influence over how the working world is perceived (i.e. what is important to the individual), and this is likely to affect the type of jobs that are sought.

=== The ten item personality inventory ===
It was first introduced in Gosling et al., (2003) and the ten items of this measure are scored using a seven-point scale, with two statements (one reversed) used to measure each personality variable. The authors report extensive data showing good reliability and validity of this instrument.

=== The work values questionnaire (WVQ) ===
This inventory introduced in Furnham et al., (2005) consists of 37 items and requires individuals to report the extent to which intrinsic (e.g.responsibility and personal growth) and extrinsic (e.g. pay and benefits) components are important to them on a six-point scale. The WVQ is a revised version of Mantech’s(1983) questionnaire. Previous studies have indicated that between two and four factors tend to be extracted, and that these often correspond to Herzberg et al.’s (1959) hygiene and motivator factors .

=== The job satisfaction scale ===
This scale introduced in Warr et al., (1979) consists of 15 items, seven of which measure intrinsic satisfaction, whilst the remaining eight measure extrinsic job satisfaction. Responses are given on a seven-point scale and can be summed to create and overall satisfaction score as well as an intrinsic and extrinsic value.

=== Experiment on personality, motivation and job satisfaction ===
In a recent issue of Journal of Managerial Psychology published in 2009 is presented an experiment with 202 full-time employees (81 males, mean age=38.3 and 121 females, mean age= 28.4) working in very different jobs in the retail, manufacturing and healthcare to investigate the extent to which personality and demographic factors explain variance in motivation and job satisfaction as defined by Herzberg et al.’s (1959) two-factor theory. Every person was given 3 questionnaires ( The ten item personality inventory, The work values questionnaire (WVQ), The job satisfaction scale) and had to complete them via a website.

As predicted, personality and demographic variables were significant correlates of the extracted factors, accounting for between 9 and 15.2 per cent of the variance. Similarly, personality and demographic variables were also significantly related to all three job satisfaction scores and accounted for between 10.5 and 12.7 per cent of the variance. As expected, conscientiousness was a significant correlate of job satisfaction scores in both correlational and regressional analyses. Contrary to expectations, age, job tenure and years working full-time were not significantly related to job satisfaction scores; however, in line with predictions and the two-factor theory, job status was significantly associated with these scores.

Negative relationships were observed between the security and conditions factor and job status, as well as years in full-time employment. These results suggest that individuals with low job status (e.g. graduate positions and non-managerial roles) are more concerned with working conditions and clarity in their work than those of a higher status and individuals who have been working for longer periods.

These results further validate the contention that work attitudes are not the product of situational factors alone, and that both literature and organisations should further investigate the variables that contribute to these values with the intention of increasing job satisfaction and performance, through effective selection methods and pervasive job interventions.

== Tools used by managerial psychologists ==

=== Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs===
[[File:Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs_Pyramid.png|thumb|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]

[[Abraham Maslow]] developed the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Hierarchy of Needs]] model in 1940-50s USA, and the Hierarchy of Needs theory remains valid today for understanding human motivation, management training, and personal development. Maslow's ideas surrounding the Hierarchy of Needs concern the responsibility of employers to provide a workplace environment that encourages and enables employees to fulfill their own unique potential (self-actualization).

While Maslow referred to various additional aspects of motivation, he expressed the Hierarchy of Needs in these five clear stages.

*'''Biological and Physiological needs''' - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep, etc.
*'''Safety needs''' - protection from elements, security, order, law, limits, stability, etc.
*'''Belongingness and Love needs''' - work group, family, affection, relationships, etc.
*'''Esteem needs''' - self-esteem, achievement, mastery, independence, status, dominance, prestige, managerial responsibility, etc.
*'''Self-Actualization needs''' - realising personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences.

=== Douglas McGregor's XY Theory ===

[[Douglas McGregor]], an American social psychologist, proposed his famous X-Y theory in his 1960 book 'The Human Side Of Enterprise'. [[Theory X and Theory Y]] are still referred to commonly in the field of management and motivation. McGregor's ideas suggest that there are two fundamental approaches to managing people. Many managers tend towards theory x, and generally get poor results. Enlightened managers use theory y, which produces better performance and results, and allows people to grow and develop.

==== Theory x ('authoritarian management' style)      ====
* The average person dislikes work and will avoid it he/she can.
* Therefore, most people must be forced with the threat of punishment to work towards organisational objectives.
* The average person prefers to be directed; to avoid responsibility; is relatively unambitious, and wants security above all else.

==== Theory y ('participative management' style) ====
* Effort in work is as natural as work and play.
* People will apply self-control and self-direction in the pursuit of organisational objectives, without external control or the threat of punishment.
* Commitment to objectives is a function of rewards associated with their achievement.
* People usually accept and often seek responsibility.
* The capacity to use a high degree of imagination, ingenuity and creativity in solving organisational problems is widely, not narrowly, distributed in the population.
* In industry the intellectual potential of the average person is only partly utilised.

=== McClelland's Human Motivation Theory      ===
'''''See also''''' [[Need theory]]

[[David McClelland]] in his 1961 book, "The Achieving Society " identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. According to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).

McClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.

==== Achievement ====
People motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.

When providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right – and wrong – so that they can improve.

==== Affiliation ====
People motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.

When providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.

==== Power ====
Those with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations  or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.

When providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Comparisonoffoodlabels.jpg|thumb|right|A voluntary Mexican nutrition label (on the left) versus its mandatory American equivalent (on the right), for the same product ([[Chips Ahoy!]] [[chocolate chip cookie]]s from [[Kraft Foods]] [[subsidiary]] [[Nabisco]]).]] --&gt;
'''Mandatory labelling''' or '''labeling''' (see [[spelling differences]]) is the requirement of consumer products to state their ingredients or components.

[[Moral purchasing]] and problems like [[allergy|allergies]] are two things which are enabled by labelling.  It is mandated in most [[developed nation]]s, and increasingly in [[developing nations]], especially for food products, ''e.g.'' "Grade A" [[meat]]s. With regard to [[food]] and [[approved drug|drugs]], mandatory labelling has been a major battleground between [[Consumer protection|consumer advocates]] and [[corporation]]s since the late 19th century.

Because of past [[scandal]]s involving deceptive labelling, countries like the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] require most processed foods to have a [[Nutrition facts label]] on the label, and the table's formatting and content must conform to strict guidelines.  The [[European Union]] equivalent is the slightly different [[Nutrition information]] table, which may also be supplemented with standardized icons indicating the presence of [[allergen]]s.

In [[China]], all [[clothing]] is labelled with the [[factory]] of origin, including [[telephone number|telephone]] and [[fax]] numbers, although this information is not available to buyers outside China, who see only a generic [[Made In China]] tag.

The development [[genetically modified food]] has led to one of the most persistent and divisive debates about the mandatory labelling, which is one of the central topics in [[genetically modified food controversies]].  Advocates of such labelling claim that the consumer should make the choice whether to expose themselves to any possible [[health risk]] from consuming such foods.  Detractors point to studies that conclude [[genetically modified food]] is safe, and point out that for many commodity products, the identity of the grower and the custody chain are not known.

Voluntary labelling and co-marketing of products deemed desirable is another matter usually carried out by entirely different means, ''e.g.'' [[Slow Food]].  There has been increased regulatory interest in substantiating these claims, and in some jurisdictions, food labels require regulatory approval before use.

An interesting halfway is those labels that are considered mandatory by one buying population and effectively preclude purchase if they are not there, e.g. [[kosher]], [[vegan]], and the aforementioned [[GMO-free]] label now seen on many [[Organic food|organic]] products.

Areas in which mandatory labelling is being discussed{{by whom|date=October 2012}} include:{{citation needed|date=February 2009}}
* [[genetically modified food]] - see [[genetically modified food controversies]]
* [[Phage therapy|spraying of meat with bacteriophages]]
* in the United States, fresh meat was added to the list of products which require mandatory [[Country of Origin label]]s (mCOOL) in 2002, however this was the subject of a challenge in the [[World Trade Organization]] by Canada, which Canada won in 2011

In an '''open-book contract''', the buyer and seller of work/services agree on (1) which costs are remunerable and (2) the margin that the supplier can add to these costs.  The project is then invoiced to the customer based on the actual costs incurred plus the agreed margin. It is essentially the same as what is known (especially in the U.S.) as a [[cost-plus contract]].

This contract form is popular to ensure that a competitive price is obtained, for instance in cases where tender competitions are impractical.  It is also useful if the work is difficult to specify precisely up front, or if the buyer is not willing to pay for the risk-premium that sellers typically add when giving fixed prices.

Frequently, an incentive is included for the supplier to give a realistic price and to minimize the costs during the project.  Typically, the mechanism for such an incentive is that the supplier gets a bonus or penalty calculated as a percentage of the difference between the real cost of the project and an estimate provided up front.  (Note: Setting the percentage at 100% would make the pricing identical to that of an [[EPCI]] contract).

Open-book contracts in third-party logistics services were popularised by [[John Anthony Harvey CBE]], head of [[Tibbett and Britten|Tibbett &amp; Britten Group plc]], between 1984 and 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1233">In [[law]], the '''ordinary course of business''' covers the usual transactions, customs and practices of a certain business and of a certain firm. This term is used particularly to judge the validity of certain transactions.  It is used in several different sections of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] of the United States.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/article1.htm#s1-201 Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code] defines a "Buyer in the ordinary course of business" by a four-part test:

# a person that buys goods in [[good faith]],
# without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;e.g. a [[security interest]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
# and in the ordinary course from a person, other than a [[pawnbroker]], '''in the business of selling goods of that kind'''.
# A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person '''comports with the usual or customary practices''' in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller's own usual or customary practices.

:&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;emphasis added&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

{{Contract law}}
An '''output contract''' is an [[contract|agreement]] in which a producer agrees to sell his or her entire production to the buyer, who in turn agrees to purchase the entire output. Example: an almond grower enters into an ''output contract'' with an almond packer: thus the producer has a "home" for output of nuts, and the packer of nuts is happy to try the particular product. The converse of this situation is a [[requirements contract]], under which a seller agrees to supply the buyer with as much of a good or service as the buyer wants, in exchange for the buyer's agreement not to buy that good or service elsewhere.

[[Uniform Commercial Code]] comment section 2-306: A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer, means such actual output or requirements that may occur in good faith. [[Good faith]] cessation of production terminates any further obligations thereunder and excuses further performance by the party discontinuing production. However, the cessation of production must be in light of [[bankruptcy]] or other similar situations. The yield of less profit from a sale than expected does not excuse further performance of an output contract. See Feld vs. Henry S. Levy &amp; Sons, Inc. (New York, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/commercial-law/commercial-law-keyed-to-lopucki/performance/feld-v-henry-s-levy-sons-inc/ Brief at CaseBriefs.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/197476545AD2d720_2489/FELD%20v.%20HENRY%20S.%20LEVY%20&amp;%20SONS,%20INC.

'''PACE Institute of Management''' (PACE) was established in 2001 as a pioneer in [[business education]] in [[Vietnam]].  Headquartered in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], Vietnam, PACE delivers  public training programs, in-house training services, seminars, conferences, and publishing.

The institute has support from business community and intellectuals in the country to develop not-profit educational projects: Institute of Potential Leaders (IPL), Business Knowledge Portal (DoanhTri.vn), GoodBooks (SachHay.com), and OneBook.

During the past five years, the institute has invited several notable scholars and thinkers to speak in Vietnam to introduce new concepts and perspectives  related to Vietnam and the larger [[South East Asia]] region.  Speakers have included  [[Michael E. Porter]], the father of the modern strategy field; [[Paul Krugman]], the 2008 Nobel Laureate in Economics; and [[Philip Kotler]], the father of modern marketing.

PACE   has a [[publishing]] arm known as DT Books (previously PACE Books) that has acquired the rights to publish and translate many   books on education, business, and management.

To date, more than 70,000 entrepreneurs and directors from corporations, local, and foreign companies have attended PACE public training programs and utilized PACE in-house training services.

'''PerForm''' and '''PerForm PRO''' were electronic form programs, initially designed to work under [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] in [[DOS]]. Later versions were designed to work in [[Windows 3.1]], at which point it was succeeded by [[FormFlow]]. 

The initial version of PerForm was created in 1988 and was the first product released by [[Canada|Canadian]] software firm [[Delrina]], which became best known for its later fax software program, [[WinFax]]. Chief Technical Officer [[Bert Amato]] and President of the company [[Mark Skapinker]] came up with the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer.&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"&gt;{{Cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program consisted of two parts: a form design module which gave users a graphical user interface for creating and arranging form elements, using tools largely familiar to those using desktop publishing or paint programs of the era, and a separate form filling program which would display the resulting form that the user could then fill in&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite web

Those entering information into the forms could not change or alter the forms; they were limited to adding information in the various form fields on screen. Some of the potential uses of the program included being able to create invoices, payment records, personnel and payroll forms, and just about any other standardized  form that may have been required.&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">'''Privatier''' ([{{IPA|pʀiˈvaˈtjeː}}], also spelled '''Privatus''', with the feminine forms '''Privata''' or '''Privatière''', meaning "private person") is a French word that was used from the 19th century in [[Germany]] and some other countries as a title by members of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] families of substantial financial means in lieu of another professional title. Much like [[wikt:rentier|rentier]], it denoted someone who did not have to work to make a living, and who lived off their assets of some size, e.g. [[interest]], [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from [[investor|investments]], [[real estate]] and [[current asset]]s. Sometimes, the title was used by affluent businessmen after they had wholly or largely retired from their former activity. For example, in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', the character Alois Permaneder, a former merchant, uses this title after his marriage to Tony Buddenbrook, after receiving a substantial [[dowry]] from her wealthy family, at which point he retires from business.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mann]]: ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', part 6, chapter 8, Frankfurt 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Process philosophy|philosophy]], a '''process ontology''' refers to a universal model of the structure of the world as an ordered wholeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas}} Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sohst, Wolfgang|url=http://www.xenomoi.de/product_info.php/info/p180_NEU--Prozessontologie--Ein-systematischer-Entwurf-der-Entstehung-von-Existenz-.html|title=Prozessontologie.

Fundamental ontologies do not claim to be accessible to any [[empirical]] proof in itself, but to be a structural design pattern, out of which empirical [[phenomena]] can be explained and put together consistently. Throughout Western history, the dominating fundamental ontology is the so-called [[substance theory]]. However, fundamental process ontologies are becoming more important in recent times, because the progress in the discovery of the foundations of physics spurred the development of a basic concept able to integrate such boundary notions as "[[energy]]," "[[Object (philosophy)|object]]", and those of the physical dimensions of [[space]] and [[time]].

In [[computer science]], a '''process ontology''' is a description of the components and their relationships that make up a process. A formal process ontology is an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the knowledge domain of processes. Often such ontologies take advantage of the benefits of an [[Upper ontology (information science)|upper ontology]]. [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning software]] can be used to perform plan generation based on the formal description of the process and its constraints. Numerous efforts have been made to define a process/planning ontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/old/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|pages=9–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==

A process may be defined as a set of transformations of input elements into output elements with specific properties, with the transformations characterized by parameters and constraints, such as in manufacturing or biology. A process may also be defined as the [[workflow]]s and [[sequence of events]] inherent in processes such as manufacturing, engineering and [[business process]]es.

== Ontologies ==

=== PSL ===
{{main|Process Specification Language}}
The Process Specification Language (PSL) is a process ontology developed for the formal description and modeling of basic manufacturing, engineering and business processes. This ontology provides a vocabulary of classes and relations for concepts at the ground level of event-instances, object-instances, and timepoints. PSL’s top level is built around the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Activity – a class or type of action, such as install-part, which is the class of actions in which parts are installed
* Activity-occurrence – an event or action that takes place at a specific place and time, such as a specific instance of install-part occurring at a specific [[timestamp]]
* Timepoint – a point in time
* Object – anything that is not a timepoint or an activity

=== Cyc ===
{{main|Cyc}}
In a process/planning ontology developed for the ontology Cyc, classes and relations above the ground level of PSL allow processes to be described purely at the type-level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Stuart|last1=Aitken|title=Process Representation and Planning in Cyc: From Scripts and Scenes to Constraints|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/plan01-ws.pdf|publisher=Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI), University of Edinburgh|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stuart|last1=Aitken|first2=Jon|last2=Curtis&lt;!--|title=A Process Ontology--&gt;|title=Design of a Process Ontology: Vocabulary, Semantics, and Usage&lt;!--|url=http://www.cyc.com/doc/white_papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf--&gt;|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|work=Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management: Ontologies and the Semantic Web|year=2002|volume=2473|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|publisher=Springer|pages=263–270|doi=10.1007/3-540-45810-7_13|ISBN=978-3-540-44268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground level of PSL uses the primitives of event-instance, object-instance, and timepoint description. The types above the ground level of PSL have also been expressed in PSL, showing that the type-level and the ground level are relatively independent. The type-levels for the Cyc process ontology above this ground level use the following concepts:
* Process – formalized as a ''script''
* Aggregate process – a process at a level above that of a single episode of a process, to represent the numbers of participants in an action by ranges of integers and qualitative values like ''few'' or ''many''
* Script – a typical pattern of events that can be expected to re-occur
** a ''script'' has subevents, which means that ''scripts'' are composite events
* Scene – a subevent of a ''script''
* Roles/participants – specifies types of actors and objects that may play in the ''script'' or ''scene''
* Conditions – precondition(s) that must be true for a ''scene'' (event) to be executable, and postcondition(s) (effects) that must be true after a ''scene''
* Repetition – the number of repetitions of a process may be known, or may be unspecified, or may be repeated until a specific condition is true
* Properties of ordering and constitution of repeated subevents for composite processes:
** Begin-Ordered – subevents start at distinct time points that are totally ordered
** End-Ordered – subevents end at distinct time points that are totally ordered
** EndsBeforeEnd – subevents end before or at the same time as subevent instances which start before them
** Sequential – no overlapping subevents
** Terminating – there is a subevent after which no other subevents begin, and since all activities have a begin and end point, there is a time point at which the process ends
** Uniform – all subevents are of the same event type
* Identity – the identity of participants in a process, that actor(s) or object(s) playing a role in one ''scene'' or repetition are the same as those in another ''scene'' or repetition, is represented by constraints on possible participants

=== SUPER and DDPO ===
The project SUPER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project IST 026850 SUPER: Business Process Ontology Framework (deliverable 1.1)|url=http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M12/D1.1.pdf|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''S'''emantics '''U'''tilised for '''P'''rocess management within and between '''E'''nte'''R'''prises) has a goal of the definition of ontologies for Semantic Business Process Management (SBPM), but these ontologies can be reused in diverse environments. Part of this project is to define an Upper Process Ontology (UPO) that ties together all other SUPER ontologies. The results of the project SUPER include the UPO and a set of ontologies for processes and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUPER Ontologies|url=http://www.ip-super.org/content/view/129/136/|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011224532/http://www.ip-super.org/content/view/129/136/ |archivedate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project IST 026850 SUPER: Process Ontology Stack, Evolved Version (deliverable 1.5)|url=http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M36/D1.5.pdf|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ontologies are written in [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]], and some are also written in [[OCML]].

A candidate model for the UPO was DDPO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|pages=27–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DOLCE+DnS Plan Ontology), a planning ontology which specifies plans and distinguishes between abstract and executable plans. [[Upper ontology (information science)#DOLCE and DnS|DOLCE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Masolo, Claudio |author2=Borgo, Stefano |author3=Gangemi, Aldo |author4=Guarino, Nicola |author5=Oltramari, Alessandro |title=WonderWeb Deliverable D18: Ontology Library|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/Papers/D18.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=c. 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOLCE: a Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering|url=http://dolce.semanticweb.org/|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. [[Upper ontology (information science)#DOLCE and DnS|DnS]] (Descriptions and Situations), is a constructivist ontology that allows for context-sensitive redescriptions of the types and relations postulated by other given ontologies (or ground vocabularies). Together in DDPO, DOLCE and DnS are used to build a Plan Ontology that includes physical and non-physical objects (social entities, mental objects and states, conceptualizations, information objects, constraints), events, states, regions, qualities, and constructivist situations. The main target of DDPO is tasks, namely the types of actions, their sequencing, and the controls performed on them.

=== oXPDL ===
The ontology oXPDL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haller, Armin |author2=Marmolowski, Mateusz |author3=Oren, Eyal |author4=Gaaloul, Walid |title=A Process Ontology for Business Intelligence|url=http://www.deri.ie/fileadmin/documents/DERI-TR-2008-04-01.pdf|publisher=Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a process interchange ontology based on the standardised XML Process Definition Language ([[XPDL]]). The purpose of oXPDL is to model the semantics of XPDL process models in standardized Web ontology languages such as [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] and [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]], while incorporating features of existing standard ontologies such as [[Process Specification Language|PSL]], [[RosettaNet]], and [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology|SUMO]].

=== GFO ===
{{main|General Formal Ontology}}
The General Formal Ontology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO)|url=http://www.onto-med.de/ontologies/gfo|publisher=Ontologies in Medicine and Life Sciences (Onto-Med)|location=University of Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Herre, Heinrich|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO): A Foundational Ontology for Conceptual Modelling|url=http://www.onto-med.de/publications/2010/gfo-basic-principles.pdf|publisher=Research Department Ontologies in Medicine and Life Sciences (Onto-Med)|location=IMISE University of Leipzig|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Upper ontology (information science)#General Formal Ontology .28GFO.29|GFO]]) is an ontology integrating processes and objects. GFO includes elaborations of categories like objects, processes, time and space, properties, relations, roles, functions, facts, and situations. GFO allows for different axiomatizations of its categories, such as the existence of atomic time-intervals vs. dense time. Two of the specialties of GFO are its account of persistence and its time model. Regarding persistence, the distinction between endurants (objects) and perdurants (processes) is made explicit within GFO by the introduction of a special category, a persistant{{sic}}. A persistant is a special category with the intention that its instances "remain identical" over time. With respect to time, time intervals are taken as primitive in GFO, and time-points (called "time boundaries") are derived. Moreover, time-points may coincide, which is convenient for modelling instantaneous changes.

=== m3po and m3pl ===
The multi metamodel process ontology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haller, Armin |author2=Oren, Eyal |title=A process ontology to represent semantics of different process and choreography meta-models|url=http://www.m3pe.org/deliverables/process-ontology.pdf|location=National University of Ireland, Galway|publisher=Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haller, A. |author2=Oren, E. |author3=Kotinurmi, P. |title=m3po: An Ontology to Relate Choreographies to Workflow Models|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)|date=September 2006|url=http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3po.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (m3po) combines workflows and choreography descriptions so that it can be used as a process interchange ontology. For internal business processes, Workflow Management Systems are used for process modelling and allow describing and executing business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Georgakopoulos, D. |author2=Hornick,  M. |author3=Sheth, A. |title=An overview of workflow management: From process modeling to workflow automation infrastructure|journal=Distributed and Parallel Databases|volume=3|issue=2|pages=119–153|year=1995|doi=10.1007/bf01277643}}&lt;/ref&gt; For external business processes, choreography descriptions are used to describe how business partners can cooperate. A choreography can be considered to be a view of an internal business process with the internal logic not visible, similar to public views on private workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chiu, D. K. W.|title=Workflow view driven cross-organizational interoperability in a web service environment|journal=Inf.

The m3po ontology is written in [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]]. The related ontology m3pl, written in [[Process Specification Language|PSL]] using the extension FLOWS (First Order Logic for Web Services), enables the extraction of choreography interfaces from workflow models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haller, A. |author2=Oren, E. |title=m3pl: A Work-FLOWS ontology extension to extract choreography interfaces|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantics for Business Process Management, in conjunction with ESWC2006|location=Budva, Montenegro|date=June 2006|url=http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3pl_sbpm2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The m3po ontology combines features of the following reference models and languages:
* [[XPDL]] – a standard for exchanging workflow models, without runtime information, between different workflow management systems
* [[Process Specification Language|PSL]] – an ontology that allows the capture of the semantics of workflow models and enables translations of models between workflow management systems
* [[YAWL]] – a research workflow language that supports all workflow patterns directly
* [[BPEL]] – an executable business process language and includes an abstract protocol
* [[WS-CDL]] – a multi-party collaboration model

The m3po ontology is organized using five key aspects of workflow specifications and workflow management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jablonski, S. |author2=Bussler, C. |title=Workflow Management: Modeling Concepts, Architecture and Implementation|publisher=International Thomson Computer Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because different workflow models put a different emphasis on the five aspects, the most elaborate reference model for each aspect was used and combined into m3po.
* Functional and Behavioural – the most important concepts are ''processType'', ''processOccurrence'', ''activityType'' and ''activityOccurrence''
* Informational – defined by data and data-flow
* Organizational – defines who is responsible for carrying out a specific task; security related issues
* Operational – interaction of the workflows with their environment by manual tasks performed by users and automatic tasks performed by automated computer programs
* Orthogonal – scheduling based on time; integrity and failure recovery

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">A '''product defect''' is any characteristic of a product which hinders its usability for the purpose for which it was designed and manufactured. 

==Definition==
Product defects arise most prominently in legal contexts, where the term is applied to "anything that renders the product not reasonably safe".&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Patricia A. Robinson, ''Writing and Designing Manuals and Warnings'' (2009), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of law that addresses injuries caused by defective products is called [[products liability]].

A wide range of circumstances can render a product defective. The product may have a '''design defect''', resulting from the product having been poorly designed or tested, so that the design itself yields a product that can not perform its desired function. Even if the design is correct, the product may have a '''manufacturing defect''' if it was incorrectly manufactured, for example if the wrong materials are used. A product may also be considered legally defective if it lacks appropriate instructions for its use, or appropriate warnings of dangers accompanying normal use or misuse of the product.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

A product that is defective in some way that does not render it dangerous might still be sold, with a [[discounts and allowances|discounted]] price reflecting the defect. For example, where a clothing manufacturer discovers that a line of shirts have been made with slightly uneven sleeves, the manufacturer may choose to sell these shirts at a discount, often through at [[outlet store]] and with the [[Label#Textile labeling|label]] cut off to indicate that the quality is not intended to reflect on the brand.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Ruppel Shell, ''Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''registered office''' is the official address of an [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] [[company (law)|company]], association or any other [[Juristic person|legal entity]]. Generally it will form part of the public record and is required in most countries where the registered [[organization]] or legal entity is incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Arthur. ''The European Film Production Guide: Finance, Tax, Legislation''. [[Routledge]], 1996. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_14gq_KsRwMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Registered+office%22+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1tAuTPSHDcWqlAfJwIyTCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Registered%20office%22%20definition&amp;f=false 21]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 3 July 2010. {{ISBN|0-415-13665-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-13665-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adirondack|first1=Sandy|last2=Taylor|first2=James Sinclair|title=Voluntary sector legal handbook|date=2008|publisher=Directory of Social Change|location=London|isbn=9781903991879|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}

==In the United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[List of country legal systems#Common law|common law countries]], the registered office address does not have to be where the organization conducts its actual business or trade, and it is not unusual for [[law firms]], [[accountant]]s or incorporation agents to provide the official registered office address service. In the United Kingdom all statutory correspondence for an incorporated organization (e.g. formal notices, [[service of process]], tax and government communications) is posted or hand delivered to the registered office address as recorded on the [[Companies House]] register. A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Under regulations implemented in the UK on 1 October 2009, company directors may now also use a registered office address instead of their private home address for contact on the Companies House register.

The company's full registered name must be visible to the public on the premises. The Company's records previously had to be kept at the registered office and available for public inspection. Since 1 October 2009 it has been possible for companies to designate a single alternative inspection location (SAIL) as a place to keep their records which must be available for public inspection.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"/&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Other countries==
In many other countries the address with which a company is registered must be where its headquarters or [[Seat (legal entity)|seat]] is located, and this will often determine the subnational registry at which the company must be registered.

Where representations of a customer are held in more than one [[data set]], achieving a single customer view can be difficult: firstly because customer identity must be traceable between the records held in those systems, and secondly because anomalies or discrepancies in the customer data must be [[data cleansing|data cleansed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atominsight.com/about-us/blog/single-customer-view-hard|title=Why building a single customer view isn’t as easy as you might think|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the acquisition by an organisation of a single customer view is one potential outcome of successful [[master data management]]. Since 31 December, 2010, maintaining a single customer view, and submitting it within 72 hours, has become mandatory for [[financial institution]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] due to new rules introduced by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Experian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fscs.org.uk/industry/single-customer-view/|title=Deposit Guarantee Scheme - Customer Review -FSCS|website=www.fscs.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index''' (SBLI) is an [[economic indicator]] from [[Thomson Reuters Indices]] and PayNet Inc. Because small businesses generally respond to changes in economic conditions more rapidly than larger businesses do, the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index serves as a [[leading indicator]] of the economy.

The index, utilizing [[small business]] loan origination data from major lenders, measures the volume of loans to Small Businesses normalized to a base year - 2005. Seasonally adjusted, the index is presented as an absolute as well as by a percent change versus the prior year.  
It is published monthly as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! width="200pt"|PRELIMINARY data
for current value reflecting most recent small business lending activity released 
! width="200pt"|REVISED data
for month preceding Preliminary released
! width="200pt"|FINAL data
for month preceding Revised released
|-
|}

The index has its highest correlation with GDP change as a leading indicator, leading between 2 and 5 months in advance. The index undergoes periodic checks to examine the accuracy of the estimates over time.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

== Methodology ==
All data is collected by PayNet, Inc. PayNet collects real-time loan information from more than 350 leading U.S. lenders. Its proprietary database encompasses over 19 million current and historic contracts worth over $1.5 trillion. 

PayNet primarily collects data from small business lenders in the United States, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to customers. Because PayNet receives its source data over time, estimates are routinely revised to reflect more complete source data. Preliminary and Revised estimates are reported as calculated without any reference to previously reported estimates for the same month. In addition, PayNet undertakes periodic studies that examine the accuracy of the estimates over time and for the existence of any systemic overstatement or understatement.

'''Small businesses''' are privately owned [[corporation]]s, [[partnership]]s, or [[sole proprietorship]]s that have fewer employees and/or less annual revenue than a regular-sized business or corporation. Businesses are defined as "small" in terms of being able to apply for government support and qualify for preferential tax policy varies depending on the country and industry. Small businesses range from fifteen employees under the [[Australia]]n ''[[Fair Work Australia|Fair Work Act 2009]]'', fifty employees according to the definition used by the [[European Union]], and fewer than five hundred employees to qualify for many U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] programs. While small businesses can also be classified according to other methods, such as annual revenues, shipments, sales, assets, or by annual gross or net revenue or net profits, the number of employees is one of the most widely used measures.

Small businesses in many countries include service or [[retail]] operations such as [[convenience store]]s, small [[grocery store]]s, [[bakery|bakeries]] or [[delicatessen]]s, [[cosmetologist|hairdressers]] or [[tradesman|tradespeople]] (e.g., [[carpenter]]s, [[electrician]]s), [[restaurant]]s, [[motel|guest houses]], [[photographer]]s, very small-scale [[manufacturing]], and Internet-related businesses such as [[web design]] and [[computer programming]]. Some professionals operate as small businesses, such as [[lawyer]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[dentist]]s and [[medical doctor]]s (although these professionals can also work for large organizations or companies). Small businesses vary a great deal in terms of size, revenues and regulatory authorization, both within a country and from country to country. Some small businesses, such as a home accounting business, may only require a business license. On the other hand, other small businesses, such as [[day care]]s, [[retirement home]]s and [[restaurant]]s serving liquor are more heavily regulated, and may require inspection and certification from various government authorities.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Centro de Sao Paulo.jpg|thumb|Small businesses in the [[Central Zone of São Paulo]].]]

Researchers and analysts of small or owner-managed businesses generally behave as if nominal organizational forms (e.g., partnership, sole-trader, or corporation), and the consequent legal and accounting boundaries of owner-managed firms are consistently meaningful. However, owner-managers often do not delineate their behavior to accord with the implied separation between their personal and business interests. Lenders also often contract around organizational (corporate) boundaries by seeking personal guarantees or accepting privately held assets as collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01531920|title=The irrelevance of organisational boundaries of owner-managed firms|first=Gregory E. P.|last=Shailer|date=1 September 1993|publisher=|journal=Small Bus Econ|volume=5|issue=3|pages=229–237|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/BF01531920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this behavior, researchers and analysts may wish to be cautious in the way they assess the organizational types and implied boundaries in contexts relating to owner-managed firms. These include analyses that use traditional accounting disclosures, and studies that view the firm as defined by some formal organizational structure.

===Concepts of small business, self-employment, entreprneurship, and startup===
[[File:Genova-Portici di Sottoripa.jpg|thumb|Portici di Sottoripa, [[Genova]], [[Italy]] Galleries tend to form clusters of small business owners over time.]]

The concepts of small business, [[self-employment]], [[entrepreneurship]], and [[startup]] overlap to certain degree but also carry important distinctions. 
These four concepts often conflated with each other. 

Below are the key differences of these concepts in summary:
* [[self-employment]]: an organization created with the primarily intention to give a job to the founders, i.e. sole proprietor operations.
* [[entrepreneurship]]: all new organizations.
* [[startup]]: a temporary new organization created with the intention to be bigger (at least have employees).
* small business: an organization that is small (few employees) and may or may not have the intention to be bigger.

From the summaries, we can see that many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner, but small businesses can have a small number of employees. When big firms start out, they are known as startups, but not all small businesses are startups that aim to become bigger. 
Many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service, and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, startups aim for growth and often offer an innovative product, process or service, and the entrepreneurs of startups typically aim to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales, and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[angel investor|angel investment]]s. Successful entrepreneurs have the ability to lead a business in a positive direction by proper planning, to adapt to changing environments and understand their own strengths and weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ondernemerstest.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ICSBv5.pdf|first1=Martyn P. |last1=Driessen |first2=Peter S. |last2=Zwart|title=The role of the entrepreneur in small business success: the Entrepreneurship Scan|year= 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectacular success stories stem from startups that expanded in growth. Examples would be Microsoft, Genentech, and Federal Express which all embody the sense of new venture creation on small business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-08-01|title=The economics of small business finance: The roles of private equity and debt markets in the financial growth cycle|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426698000387|journal=Journal of Banking &amp; Finance|language=en|volume=22|issue=6-8|pages=613–673|doi=10.1016/S0378-4266(98)00038-7|issn=0378-4266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-employment provides works primarily for the founders. Entrepreneurship refers all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to grow big or become registered, but startups refer to new businesses that intend to grow beyond the founders, to have employees, and grow large.

=== Size definitions ===
The legal definition of "small business" varies by country and by industry. In addition to number of employees, methods used to classify small companies include annual [[sales]] (turnover), value of [[assets]] and [[net profit]] (balance sheet), alone or as a combination of factors.

*In the [[United States]], the [[Small Business Administration]] establishes small business size standards on an industry-by-industry basis, but generally specifies a small business as having fewer than 500 employees for manufacturing businesses and less than $7.5 million in annual receipts for most non-manufacturing businesses.&lt;ref name="SBA Size"&gt;Small Business Administration. [http://www.sba.gov/content/summary-size-standards-industry Summary of Size]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dilger|first1=Robert Jay|title=Small Business Size Standards: A Historical Analysis of Contemporary Issues|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40860.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition can vary by circumstance—for example, a small business having fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees with average annual wages below $50,000 qualifies for a [[SHOP tax credit|tax credit]] under the health care reform bill [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=223666,00.html Small Business Health Care Tax Credit for Small Employers]. IRS.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a '''medium-sized business''' or '''mid-sized business''' has fewer than 500 employees.
*The [[European Union]] generally defines a small business as one that has fewer than fifty employees and either turnover or balance sheet less than €10 m.&lt;ref name=what&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business-friendly-environment/sme-definition_en What is an SME?] accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but the European Commission is undertaking a review of this definition.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs [http://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2017-2868537_en Revision of the EU SME Definition: Inception Impact Assessment], accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a '''medium-sized business''' has fewer than 250 employees and either turnover less than €50 m. or balance sheet less than €43 m.&lt;ref name=what /&gt;
*In [[Australia]], a small business is defined by the ''[[Fair Work Australia|Fair Work Act 2009]]'' as one with fewer than fifteen employees. By comparison, a '''medium-sized business''' or '''mid-sized business''' has fewer than two hundred employees.
*In [[South Africa]], the National Small Business Amendment Act (Act 26 of 2003) defines businesses in a variety of ways using five categories previously established by the National Small Business Act (Act 102 of 1996), namely, standard industrial sector and subsector classification, size of class, equivalent of paid employees, turnover and asset value excluding fixed property.&lt;ref&gt;Banking Association South Africa, [http://www.banking.org.za/what-we-do/sme/sme-definition Small Business Definition], accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Small businesses are usually not dominant in their field of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Small Businesses joined by Facebook|url=http://stevekaplandigital.com/facebook-joining-the-ranks-of-small-business-week/|accessdate=13 May 2014|year=2014|publisher=Steve Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics ===
In 2016 a study that examined the demographic of small business owners was published. The study showed that the median American small business owners were above the age of 50. The ages were distributed as: 51% over 50 years old, 33% between the ages 35–49, and 16% being under the age of 35. As for sex: 55% were owned by males, 36% by females, and 9% being equal ownership of both males and females. As for race: 72% were white/Caucasian, 13.5% were Latinos, 6.3% were African American, 6.2% were Asian, and 2% as other. As for educational background: 39% had obtained a bachelor's degree or higher, 33% had some college background, and 28% received at least a high school diploma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smallbizlabs.com/2016/06/the-demographics-of-small-business-owners.html|title=The Surprising Demographics of Small Business Owners|website=Small Business Labs|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States census data for the years 2014 and 2015 shows the women's ownership share of small businesses by firm size. The data explains percentages owned by women along with the number of employees including the owner. Generally, the smaller the business, the more likely to be owned by a woman.  The data shows that about 22% of small businesses with 100-500 employees were owned by women, a percentage that rises the smaller the business.  41% of businesses with just 2-4 employees were run by women, and in businesses with just one person, that person was a woman 51% of the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Franchise businesses===
[[Franchising]] is a way for small business owners to benefit from the economies of scale of the big corporation (franchiser). [[McDonald's]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] are examples of a franchise. The small business owner can leverage a strong brand name and purchasing power of the larger company while keeping their own investment affordable. However, some franchisees conclude that they suffer the "worst of both worlds" feeling they are too restricted by corporate mandates and lack true independence. It is an assumption that small business are just franchisees, but the truth is many franchisers are also small businesses, Although considered to be a successful way of doing business, literature has proved that there is a high failure rate in franchising as well, especially in UK, where research indicates that out of 1658 franchising companies operating in 1984, only 601 remained in 1998, a mere 36%.&lt;ref&gt;*Healeas, S. Purdy, D. Stanworth, C. Watson, A.2004. Franchising as small business growth strategy: A resource based view organisational development : International small business journal,22(6), pp 539-599

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retailers' cooperative===
A [[retailers' cooperative]] is a type of cooperative which employs [[economies of scale]] on behalf of its retailer members. Retailers' cooperatives use their purchasing power to acquire discounts from manufacturers and often share marketing expenses. They are often recognized as "local groups" because they own their own stores within the community.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncdc.unl.edu/typescooperatives.shtml|title=Types of Cooperatives {{!}} Nebraska Cooperative Development Center|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=ncdc.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for locally owned grocery stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies to participate in retailers' cooperatives. [[Ace Hardware]], [[True Value]], and [[National Automotive Parts Association|NAPA]] are examples of a retailers' cooperative. Retail cooperatives also allow consumers to supply their own earnings and gain bargaining power outside of the business sector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Retail cooperatives mainly reside within small communities where local businesses are often shut down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Advantages==
[[File:BursaMercatiVerde.jpg|thumb|Small business in [[Bursa]], [[Turkey]]. One of the claimed advantages of small business owners is the ability to serve [[market niche]]s not served by [[mass production]] industries. Consider how few major corporations would be willing to deal the risks and uncertainty that small antique store deals with: buying and selling non-standardized items and making quick assessments of the value of rare items.]]

Many small businesses can be started at a low cost and on a part-time basis, while a person continues a regular job with an employer or provides care for family members in the home. In developing countries, many small businesses are sole-proprietor operations such as selling produce at a market stall or preparing hot food to sell on the street, that provide a small income. In the 2000s, a small business is also well suited to [[Internet]] [[marketing]]; because, it can easily serve specialized niches, something that would have been more difficult prior to the Internet revolution which began in the late 1990s. Internet marketing gives small businesses the ability to market with smaller budgets. Adapting to change is crucial in business and particularly small business; not being tied to the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] inertia associated with large corporations, small businesses can respond to changing marketplace demand more quickly. Small business proprietors tend to be in closer personal contact with their customers and clients than large corporations, as small business owners see their customers in person each week.

One study showed that small, local businesses are better for a local economy than the introduction of new chain stores. By opening up new national level chain stores, the profits of locally owned businesses greatly decrease and many businesses end up failing and having to close. This creates an exponential effect. When one store closes, people lose their jobs, other businesses lose business from the failed business, and so on. In many cases, large firms displace just as many jobs as they create.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = W.F. | last2 = Murray | first2 = M.N. | year = 2004 | title = Do Economic Effects Justify the Use of Fiscal Incentives? | url = | journal = Southern Economic Journal | volume = 71 | issue = 1| pages = 78–92 | doi=10.2307/4135311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence is another advantage of owning a small business. A small business owner does not have to report to a supervisor or manager. In addition, many people desire to make their own decisions, take their own risks, and reap the rewards of their efforts. Small business owners possess the flexibility and freedom to making their own decisions within the constraints imposed by economic and other environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Longenecker |first= Justin G. |author2=Carlos W. Moore |author3=J. William Petty |author4=Leslie E. Palich |title= Small business management : launching and growing entrepreneurial ventures. | edition= 14th | page= 768 | publisher= [[Cengage Learning]] | oclc=191487420 | year= 2008 |isbn= 0-324-56972-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, entrepreneurs have to work for very long hours and understand that ultimately their customers are their bosses.

Several organizations in the United States also provide help for the small business sector, such as the Internal Revenue Service's Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed |title=Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2010-09-26 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Small businesses (often carried out by family members) adjust quicker to the changing conditions; however, they are closed to the absorption of new knowledge and employing new labor from outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walczak | first1 = D. | last2 = Voss | first2 = G. | year = | title = New Possibilities of Supporting Polish SMEs within the Jeremie Initiative Managed by BGK | url = http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/view/1144/1173 | journal = Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = 759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Small businesses often face a variety of problems, some of which are related to their size. A frequent cause of [[bankruptcy]] is [[undercapitalization|under capitalization]]. This is often a result of poor planning rather than economic conditions. It is a common "rule of thumb" that the [[entrepreneur]] should have access to a sum of money at least equal to the projected revenue for the first year of business in addition to his or her anticipated expenses. For example, if the prospective owner thinks that he or she will generate $100,000 in revenues in the first year with $150,000 in start-up expenses, then he or she should have not less than $250,000 available. Start-up expenses are often grossly underestimated adding to the burden of the business.  Failure to provide this level of funding for the company could leave the owner liable for all of the company's debt should he or she end up in bankruptcy [[court]], under the theory of [[undercapitalization|under capitalization]].

In addition to ensuring that the business has enough capital, the small business owner must also be mindful of contribution margin ([[sales]] minus [[variable cost]]s). To break even, the business must be able to reach a level of sales where the contribution margin equals [[fixed cost]]s. When they first start out, many small business owners under price their products to a point where even at their maximum capacity, it would be impossible to break even. [[Cost control]]s or price increases often resolve this problem.

In the [[United States]], some of the largest concerns of small business owners are [[insurance]] costs (such as [[Legal liability|liability]] and [[health insurance|health]]), rising [[petroleum|energy]] costs, [[tax]]es, and [[Tax#Costs of compliance|tax compliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wbginvestmentclimate.org/uploads/SBTCC_Consolidated_Web.pdf|title = Surveying Businesses on Tax Compliance Costs |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], small business owners tend to be more concerned with excessive governmental [[red tape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=098116384X|title = Small Business: The Art Of The Start |accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracting fraud has been an ongoing problem for small businesses in the [[United States]]. Small businesses are legally obligated to receive a fair portion (23 percent) of the total value of all the government's prime contracts as mandated by the Small Business Act of 1953. Since 2002, a series of federal investigations have found fraud, abuse, loopholes, and a lack of oversight in federal small business contracting, which has led to the diversion of billions of dollars in small business contracts to large corporations.

Another problem for many small businesses is termed the 'Entrepreneurial Myth' or E-Myth. The [[:wikt:mythic|mythic]] assumption is that an expert in a given technical field will also be expert at running that kind of business. Additional business management skills are needed to keep a business running smoothly. Some of this misunderstanding arises from the failure to distinguish between small business managers as entrepreneurs or capitalists. While nearly all owner-managers of small firms are obliged to assume the role of capitalist, only a minority will act as entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isb.sagepub.com/content/12/3/33.abstract Shailer, G. Capitalists and Entrepreneurs in Owner-managed Firms. ''International Small Business Journal'' 12(3) April-June 1994: 33–41].&lt;/ref&gt; The line between an owner-manager and an entrepreneur can be defined by whether or not their business is growth oriented. In general, small business owners are primarily focused on surviving rather than growing; therefore, not experiencing the five stages of the corporate life cycle (birth, growth, maturity, revival, and decline) like an entrepreneur would.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/3121621781/fmt/pi/rep/NONE?hl=&amp;cit:auth=Armstrong,%20Craig%20E&amp;cit:title=Competence%20or%20flexibility?%20Survival%20and%20growth%20implications%20of%20...&amp;cit:pub=Journal%20of%20Strategy%20and%20Management&amp;cit:vol=6&amp;cit:iss=4&amp;cit:pg=377&amp;cit:date=2013&amp;ic=true&amp;cit:prod=ABI/INFORM%20Complete&amp;_a=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&amp;_s=isTHBF+8fhiXE4YF6oLH5yZLbn0=#statusbar=1&amp;zoom=110&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem for many small businesses is the capacity of much larger businesses to influence or sometimes determine their chances for success. [[Business networking]] and [[social media]] has been used as a major tool by small businesses in the UK, but most of them just use a "scatter-gun" approach in a desperate attempt to exploit the market which is not that successful.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, A., 2013. Targeting networking and social media; how to win new business effectively. The Guardian, [online]27 November. Available at https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/nov/27/targeted-networking-social-media-business [accessed 15 March 2014]
&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of small firms lack a [[business plan]], a tool that is considered one of the most important factors for a venture's success. Business planning is associated with improved growth prospects. Funders and investors usually require a business plan. A plan also serves as a strategic planning document for owners and CEOs, which can be used as a "bible" for decision-making &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richbell | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Wardle | first2 = P. | last3 = Watts | first3 = H. D. | year = 2006 | title = Owner-managers and Business Planning in the Small Firm | url = | journal = International Small Business Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 496–514 | doi=10.1177/0266242606067275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international trade survey indicated that the British share of businesses which are exporting rose from 32% in 2012 to 39% in 2013. Although this may seem positive, in reality the growth is slow, as small business owners shy away from exporting due to actual and perceived barriers.
Learning the basics of a foreign language could be the solution to open doors to new trade markets, it is a reality that not all foreign business partners speak English. China is stated to grow by 7.6% in 2013 and still sadly 95% of business owners who want to export to China have no desire and no knowledge to learn their local language.&lt;ref name="Digital Resource"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalresource1.wordpress.com/2015/06/25/profitable-tactics-using-internet-marketing-for-small-business/|title=Profitable Tactics Using Internet Marketing For Small Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy===
When small business fails, the owner may file for bankruptcy. In most cases, this can be handled through a [[personal bankruptcy]] [[filing (legal)|filing]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Corporations can file bankruptcy, but if it is out of business and valuable corporate assets are likely to be repossessed by secured creditors, there is little advantage to going to the expense of a corporate bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Many states offer exemptions for small business assets so they can continue to operate during and after personal bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, corporate assets are normally not exempt; hence, it may be more difficult to continue operating an incorporated business if the owner files bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
Researchers have examined small business failures in some depth, with attempts to model the predictability of failure.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://isb.sagepub.com/content/7/4/54 Shailer, G. 1989, The Predictability of Small Enterprise Failures: Evidence and Issues, ''International Small Business Journal'', Vol.7, No. 4, July-September, pp. 54-58.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A list of examples is available at [http://ser.e-contentmanagement.com/archives/references/4156 ICSB].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social responsibility===
Small businesses can encounter several problems related to engaging in [[corporate social responsibility]], due to characteristics inherent in their size. Owners of small businesses often participate heavily in the day-to-day operations of their companies. This results in a lack of time for the owner to coordinate socially responsible efforts, such as supporting local charities or not-for-profit activities.&lt;ref name="Lepoutre, Jan 2006"&gt;Lepoutre, Jan, and Hoyehnusy Ezekiel "Investigating the Impact of Firm Size on Small Business Social Responsibility: A Critical Review." Journal of Business Ethics 67.3 (2006): 257-273. JSTOR. Web. 3 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a small business owner's expertise often falls outside the realm of socially responsible practices, which contributing to a lack of participation. Small businesses also face a form of [[peer pressure]] from larger forces in their respective industries, making it difficult to oppose and work against industry expectations.&lt;ref name="Lepoutre, Jan 2006"/&gt; Furthermore, small businesses undergo stress from shareholder expectations. Because small businesses have more personal relationships with their patrons and local shareholders, they must also be prepared to withstand closer scrutiny if they want to share in the benefits of committing to socially responsible practices or not.
&lt;ref name="Lepoutre, Jan 2006" /&gt;

===Job quality===
While small businesses employ over half the workforce in the US &lt;ref name="United States 2011"&gt;United States. Small Business Administration. "Frequently Asked Questions." Frequently Asked Question About Small Business. SBA Office of Advocacy, Jan. 2011. Web. 21 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been established as a main driving force behind job creation,&lt;ref name="Edmiston, Kelley 2007"&gt;Edmiston, Kelley. "The Role of Small and Large Businesses in Economic Development." Economic Review 92.2 (2007): 73-97. Academic Search Complete. Web. 18 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the quality of the jobs these businesses create has been called into question. Small businesses generally employ individuals from the [[Secondary labor market|Secondary labour market]]. As a result, in the U.S., wages are 49% higher for employees of large firms.&lt;ref name="Edmiston, Kelley 2007"/&gt; Additionally, many small businesses struggle or are unable to provide employees with benefits they would be given at larger firms. Research from the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] indicates that employees of large firms are 17% more likely to receive benefits including salary, paid leave, paid holidays, bonuses, insurance, and [[retirement plan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hope | first1 = John B. | last2 = Mackin | first2 = Patrick C. | year = 2007 | title = The Relationship Between Employee Turnover and Employee Compensation in Small Business | url = | journal = Small Business Research Summary | volume = 308 | issue = | pages = 1–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both lower wages and fewer benefits combine to create a job turnover rate among U.S. small businesses that is three times higher than large firms.&lt;ref name="Edmiston, Kelley 2007"/&gt; Employees of small businesses also must adapt to the higher failure rate of small firms, which means that they are more likely to lose their job due to the firm going under. In the U.S. 69% of small businesses last at least two years, but this percentage drops to 51% for firms reaching five years in operation.&lt;ref name="United States 2011"/&gt; The U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] counts companies with as much as $35.5 million in sales and 1,500 employees as "small businesses", depending on the industry. Outside government, companies with less than $7 million in sales and fewer than five hundred employees are widely considered small businesses.

=== Cyber crime ===
{{Main|Cyber crime}}

Cyber crime, in the business world can be broken down into 4 main categories. They include loss of reputation and consumer confidence, cost of fixing the issue, loss of capital and assets, and legal difficulties that can come from these problems. Loss of reputation and consumer confidence can be impacted greatly after one attack. Many small businesses will struggle to gain confidence and trust in their customers after being known for having problems prior. Cost of fixing the cyber attack would require experts outside of their field to further the investigation and find the problem. Being down for a business means losing money at the same time. This could halt the online operations and mean the business could potentially be down for a long period of time. Loss of capital and assets ties well in with the cost of fixing the issue. During a cyber attack, a business may lose their funds for that business. Worst-case scenario, a business may actually lose all their working capital and funds. The legal difficulties involved with cyber crime can become pricy and hurt the business itself for not having standard security measures and standards. Security not only for the business but more importantly the customer should be number one priority when dealing with security protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessknowhow.com/security/cybercrime.htm|title=4 Ways Cyber Crime Can Hurt Your Small Business|work=Business Know-How|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monetary dollar damage caused by cyber crime in 2016 equalled out to be over 1.33 billion dollars in the United States alone. In 2016, California alone had over 255 million dollars reported to the IC3. The average company this year in the United States amounted to 17.36 million dollars in cyber crime attacks. Certain cyber attacks can vary on how long it takes to solve a problem. It can take upwards to 69 days for an average everyday attack on a business. The types of attacks include viruses and malware issues. Employee activities within the workspace can also render a cyber attack. Employees using mobile devices or remote work access off the job makes it easier for a cyber attack to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/1731/smb-and-cyber-crime/|title=Topic: U.S. companies and cyber crime|website=www.statista.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
Although small businesses have close relationships with their existing customers, finding new customers and reaching new markets is a major challenge for small business owners. Small businesses typically find themselves strapped for time to do marketing, as they have to run the day-to-day aspects of the business. To create a continual stream of new business and find new clients and customers, they must work on marketing their business continuously. Low sales (result of poor marketing) is one of the major reasons of small business failure. Common marketing techniques for small business include [[business networking]] (e.g., attending [[Chamber of Commerce]] events or [[trade fair]]s), "[[word of mouth]]" promotion by existing customers, customer referrals, [[Yellow pages]] directories, television, radio, and outdoor ads (e.g., roadside billboards), print ads, and Internet marketing. TV ads can be quite expensive, so they are normally intended to create awareness of a product or service. Another means by which small businesses can advertise is through the use of "deal of the day" websites such as [[Groupon]] and [[Living Social]]. These Internet deals encourage customers to patronize small businesses.

[[File:Keyword-research-competition-analysis.jpg|thumb|left|Example of keyword analysis based on market competition.]]

Many small business owners find internet marketing more affordable. [[Google AdWords]] and [[Yahoo! Search Marketing]] are two popular options of getting small business products or services in front of motivated web searchers. Social media has also become an affordable route of marketing for small business. It is a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing and small businesses are able to do it themselves or find small social marketing agencies that they can hire out for a small fee. Statistically, social media marketing has a higher lead-to-close rate than traditional media.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Successful online small business marketers are also adept at utilizing the most relevant [[Index term|keywords]] in their website content. Advertising on [[Niche market|niche]] websites that are frequented by potential customers can also be effective, but with the [[long tail]] of the Internet, it can be time intensive to advertise on enough websites to garner an effective [[Reach (advertising)|reach]].

Creating a business website has become increasingly affordable with many [[do-it-yourself]] programs now available for beginners. A website can provide significant marketing exposure for small businesses when marketed through the Internet and other channels. Some popular services are [[WordPress]], [[Joomla]] [[Squarespace]], [[Wix.com|Wix]] and EXAI . [[Social media]] has proven to be very useful in gaining additional exposure for many small businesses. Many small business owners use [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] as a way to reach out to their loyal customers to give them news about specials of the day or special coupons, generate repeat business and reach out to new potential clients. The relational nature of social media, along with its immediacy and twenty-four-hour presence lend intimacy to the relationships small businesses can have with their customers, while making it more efficient for them to communicate with greater numbers. [[Facebook]] ads are also a very cost-effective way for small businesses owners to reach a targeted audience with a very specific message. In addition to the social networking sites, [[blogs]] have become a highly effective way for small businesses to position themselves as experts on issues that are important to their customers. This can be done with a proprietary [[blog]] and/or by using a back-link strategy wherein the marketer comments on other [[blogs]] and leaves a link to the small business' own website. Posting to a blog about the company's business or service area regularly can increase web traffic to a company website.

'''Marketing plan'''
* '''[[Marketing research|Market research]]''' – To produce a marketing plan for small businesses, research needs to be done on similar businesses, which should include [[Secondary research|desk research]] (done online or with directories) and [[field research]]. This gives an insight in the [[Target audience|target]] group’s behavior and shopping patterns. Analyzing the competitor’s marketing strategies makes it easier for small business to gain [[market share]].
* '''[[Marketing mix]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Dave|title=Business for Higher Awards|year=1996|publisher=Heinemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Marketing mix is a crucial factor for any business to be successful. Especially for a small business, examining a competitor’s marketing mix can be very helpful. An appropriate market mix, which uses different types of marketing, can help to boost sales.
* '''[[Product lifecycle|Product life cycle]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kotler|first=Philip|title=Principles of Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; – After the launch of the business, crucial points of focus should be the growth phase (adding customers, adding products or services, and/or expanding to new markets) and working towards the maturity phase. Once the business reaches maturity stage, an extension strategy should be in place. Re-launching is also an option at this stage. [[Pricing strategies|Pricing strategy]] should be flexible and based on the different stages of the product life cycle.
* '''[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion techniques]]''' – It is preferable to keep promotion expenses as low as possible. ‘Word of mouth’, ‘email marketing’, ‘print-ads’ in local newspapers etc. can be effective.
* '''[[Distribution (business)|Channels of distribution]]''' – Selecting an effective channel of distribution may reduce the promotional expenses as well as overall expenses for a small business.

==Contribution to the economy==
In the US, small businesses (fewer than five hundred employees) account for more than half the non-farm, private GDP and around half the private sector employment.&lt;ref name="United States 2011"/&gt; Regarding small business, the top job provider is those with fewer than ten [[employee]]s, and those with ten or more but fewer than twenty [[employee]]s comes in as the second, and those with twenty or more but fewer than one hundred [[employee]]s comes in as the third (interpolation of data from the following references).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/sb_econ2001.pdf The Small Business Economy - A Report to the President: 2001 pg. 84 - Table A.3] (the last time data was granular enough for the figures for fewer than 10 employees was 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent data shows firms with fewer than twenty employees account for slightly more than 18% of the employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/sb_econ2008.pdf |title=U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy: The Small Business Economy 2008, A Report to the President |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to "The Family Business Review," "There are approximately seventeen million sole-proprietorship in the US. It can be argued that a sole-proprietorship (an unincorporated business owned by a single person) is a type of family business" and "there are twenty-two million small businesses (fewer than five hundred employees) in the US and approximately 14,000 big businesses." Also, it has been found that small businesses created the newest jobs in communities, "In 1979, David Birch published the first empirical evidence that small firms (fewer than 100 employees) created the most new jobs", and Edmiston claimed that "perhaps the greatest generator of interest in entrepreneurship and small business is the widely held belief that small businesses in the United States create most new jobs. The evidence suggests that small businesses indeed create a substantial majority of net new jobs in an average year." The U.S. Small Business Administration has found small businesses have created two-thirds of net new private sector jobs in the US since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Job_Creation_fact_sheet_FINAL_0.pdf |title=Small Business Facts: Small Business Job Creation Deconstructed |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local businesses provide competition to each other and also challenge corporate giants. Of the 5,369,068 employer firms in 1995, 78.8 percent had fewer than ten employees, and 99.7 percent had fewer than five hundred employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sba.gov/advo/stats/ch_em97.pdf |title=Office of Advocacy - U.S. SBA - Characteristics of Small Business Employees and Owners |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of funding==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 119152 Small businesses in Biloela, 1949.jpg|thumb|Small businesses in [[Biloela]], [[Central Queensland]], [[Australia]], 1949]]

Small businesses use various sources available for start-up [[Financial capital|capital]]:
* Self-financing by the owner through cash savings, [[Ownership equity|equity]] [[loan]] on his or her home, and or other assets
* Loans or financial gifts from friends or relatives
* Grants from private foundations, government or other sources
* Private [[stock]] issue
* Forming [[partnerships]]
* [[Angel investor]]s
* Loans from banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions
* [[SME finance]], including collateral-based lending and [[venture capital]], given sufficiently sound business venture plans

Some small businesses are further financed through [[credit card]] debt—usually a poor choice, given that the interest rate on credit cards is often several times the rate that would be paid on a [[line of credit]] at a bank or a [[bank]] [[loan]]. Recent research suggests that the use of credit scores in small business lending by community banks is surprisingly widespread. Moreover, the scores employed tend to be the consumer credit scores of the small business owners rather than the more encompassing small business credit scores that include data on the firms as well as on the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/wp0909.pdf |title=The Surprising Use of Credit Scoring in Small Business Lending by Community Banks and the Attendant Effects on Credit Availability and Risk |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many owners seek a bank loan in the name of their business; however, banks will usually insist on a personal guarantee by the business owner.

In the [[United States]], the [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA) runs several loan programs that may help a small business secure loans. In these programs, the SBA guarantees a portion of the loan to the issuing bank, and thus, relieves the bank of some of the risk of extending the loan to a small business. The SBA also requires business owners to pledge personal assets and sign as a personal guarantee for the loan. The [[8(a) Business Development Program]] assists in the development of small businesses owned and operated by [[African American]]s, Hispanics, and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sba.gov/content/8a-business-development-0 8(a) Business Development]". SBA.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian small businesses can take advantage of federally funded programs and services. See [[Federal financing for small businesses in Canada (grants and loans)]].

On October 2010, [[Alejandro Cremades]] and Tanya Prive founded the first equity [[crowdfunding]] platform&lt;ref name="Equity Crowdfunding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://equitycrowdfunding.net|title=Equity Crowdfunding|work=Equity Crowdfunding |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for small businesses in history as an alternative source of financing. The platform operates under the name of Rock The Post.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/crowdfunding-comes-to-small-businesses-2012-6|title=Crowdfunding comes to small businesses|work=Business Insider |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business networks and advocacy groups==
Small businesses often join or come together to form organizations to advocate for their causes or to achieve [[economies of scale]] that larger businesses benefit from, such as the opportunity to buy cheaper [[health insurance]] in bulk. These organizations include local or regional groups such as [[Chambers of Commerce]] and [[independent business alliances]], as well as national or international industry-specific organizations. Such groups often serve a dual purpose, as [[business network]]s to provide marketing and connect members to potential sales leads and suppliers, and also as advocacy groups, bringing together many small businesses to provide a stronger voice in regional or national [[politics]]. In the case of independent business alliances, promoting the value of locally owned, independent business (not necessarily small) through public education campaigns is integral to their work.

The largest regional small business group in the [[United States]] is the [[Council of Smaller Enterprises]], located in [[Greater Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=STEVE LOHR Special to The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/01/15/archives/smallbusiness-forces-unite-meeting-drafts-proposals-for-carter.html |title=Steve Lohr, "Small-Business Forces Unite; Meeting Drafts Proposals For Carter Memories of Earlier Gatherings Small-Business Forces Unite", ''The New York Times'', Special, Jan. 15, 1980, Business &amp; Finance, Page D1 |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=1980-01-15 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
United Kingdom trade and Investment (www.ukti.gov.in) gives out research in different markets around the world, also research in program planning and promotional activities to exporters. The BEXA (British Exporters Association) role is to connect new exporters to expert services, it can provide details about regional export contacts, who could be made informally to discuss issues. Trade associations and all major banks could often provide links to international groups in foreign markets, some could also help set up joint venture, trade fairs etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Senior|first=Norah|title=Small businesses need to see exporting as a viable option and 'think global'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/nov/18/why-small-businesses-should-export|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of youth organizations, including [[4-H]], [[Junior Achievement]], and [[Scouting]] have special interactive programs and training to help young people run their own small business under adult supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintour.com/meritbadge/american_business.htm American Business BSA Merit Badge Guide], 22 Jun 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Viability study''' is an in depth investigation of the [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] of the [[business idea]] to be converted into a business enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuizen, C., Le Roux, E.E. and Jacobs, H., (2004). Entrepreneurship and how to establish your own business. 2nd Edition, Juta, Pretoria, RSA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasibility report==
This type of report studies a situation (for example, a problem or opportunity) and the plan for doing something about it, then determines whether that plan is "feasible". This would involve determining whether it is technologically possible to achieve and whether it is practical in the current technological, economical and social scenario. The feasibility report does not provide a simple "Yes" or "No" answer, but is used in the [[analysis]] of a decision. It is not just a tool to provide a recommendation, it is also used to gather data and give reasoning behind the recommendation given, to be later used in evaluation.

This study is the most important especially to people who plan to start their own business.

==Recommendation report==
{{Seealso|SWOT Analysis}}
This type of report examines either a stated need or a selection of choices, or in some cases both. The report is a collection of analysis and evaluation of the situation, and generally will examine the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the situation, take them into account, and be combined with the feasibility report in order to give a recommendation. Sometimes a recommendation can be given to do nothing, if all options currently possible would prove unbeneficial. The recommendation report answers the question "Which option should we choose?" (or "Which are the best options?") by allowing a recommendation to be made. This can be linked into the analysis of the [[continuum of choice]] in the scenario.

==Evaluation report==
This type of report provides an opinion or judgment rather that is based on the above two report, along with additional data available. It provides a studied opinion on the value or worth of something. This type of report compares the object of the analysis to a set of requirements (or [[:wikt:criteria|criteria]]) and determines how well it meets those requirements. Generally, the evaluation report will feature an overall recommendation on the course of action to be taken.
