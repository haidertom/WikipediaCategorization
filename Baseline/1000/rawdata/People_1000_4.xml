'''Amati''' is the last name of a family of [[Italy|Italian]] [[violin]] makers who lived at [[Cremona]] from about 1538 to 1740. Their importance is considered equal to those of the [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], [[Guarneri]], and [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]] families. Today, violins created by Nicolò Amati are valued at around $600,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm Violin Price Histories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210444/http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm |date=2011-07-17 }}, violinadvisor.com, accessed 18 martie 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family members==

===Andrea Amati===
{{main|Andrea Amati}}
'''Andrea Amati''' ({{circa|1505}}{{snd}}{{circa|1578}}) designed and created the violin, viola and cello known as the "violin family". He standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. Makers from nearby [[Brescia]] experimented, such as Gasparo da Salò, Micheli, Zanetto and Pellegrino, but it was Andrea Amati in Cremona, Italy, who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile.

The first violin was ordered by [[Lorenzo De Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]] in 1555. His letter to Amati stated the instrument was to be "made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute, but simple to play". What became of this first violin is not known. A number of his instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (Amati made the first Cello called "The King" in 1538 [1]{{Clarify|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--Does this bracketed number mean the first instrument Amati produced in that year, January [or possibly March, considering that Italian years at the time were often reckoned as starting in that month], or is it an artifact from a cut-and-paste job from a possibly copyrighted webpage?--&gt;) and 1574. The largest number these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by [[Catherine De Medici|Catherine de Médicis]] the regent queen of France and bore hand painted royal French decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son [[Charles IX of France]]. Of these 38 instruments ordered, Amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. They were in use until the French revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. His work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design.

Ed. Robin Stowell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. 1–29. {{doi|10.1017/CCOL9780521390330.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antonio and Girolamo Amati ===
Andrea Amati was succeeded by his sons [[Antonio Amati]] ({{circa|1537}}–1607) and [[Girolamo Amati]] ({{circa|1551}}–1630). "The Brothers Amati", as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the [[f-holes]]. They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]], in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that [[Gasparo da Salo]] made violas ranging from altos of 39&amp;nbsp;cm to tenors of 44.7&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Nicolo Amati===
{{main|Nicolò Amati}}
'''Nicolò Amati''' (December 3, 1596{{snd}}April 12, 1684) was the son of Girolamo Amati. He was the most eminent of the family. He improved the model adopted by the rest of the Amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of [[timbre|tone]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amati|volume=1|page=783}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the "Grand Amati", which have become his most sought-after violins.

Of his pupils, the most famous were [[Antonio Stradivari]] and [[Andrea Guarneri]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; the first of the Guarneri family of violin makers. (There is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of Antonio Stradivari. While the label on Stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of Amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.)

=== Girolamo Amati (Hieronymus II) ===
The last maker of the family was Nicolò's son, [[Girolamo Amati]], known as '''Hieronymus II''' (February 26, 1649{{snd}}February 21, 1740). Although he improved on the arching of his father's instruments, by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day, Antonio Stradivari.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2012}}

'''Amedy Coulibaly''' ({{IPA-fr|amɛdi kulibali}}; 27 February 1982 – 9 January 2015) was a [[Malians in France|Malian-French]] man who was the prime suspect in the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Montrouge shooting]], in which [[Municipal Police (France)|municipal police]] officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot and killed, and was the hostage-taker and gunman in the [[Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege]], in which he killed four hostages before being killed by police.

He was a close friend of [[Charlie Hebdo shooting#Ch.C3.A9rif and Sa.C3.AFd Kouachi|Saïd and Chérif Kouachi]], the gunmen in the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], to which Coulibaly's shootings were connected.

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic State magazine interviews Hayat Boumeddiene|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/islamic-state-magazine-interviews-hayat-boumeddiene|website=Guardian.com|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

==Early life==
[[File:GrandeBornePlaineCentrale.jpg|thumb|left|260px| Coulibaly grew up on [[La Grande Borne]] housing estate.]]

A week before the attacks, on 4 January 2015 Coulibaly rented a house in [[Gentilly, Val-de-Marne]], in the southern Paris suburbs.

==Shootings on 7–9 January 2015==
{{See also|Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege|January 2015 Île-de-France attacks#Fontenay-aux-Roses and Montrouge shootings}}
Coulibaly is said to be responsible for three shootings, and he said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt; In the shootings, five people were killed and eleven others were wounded.

The first shooting was of a jogger who was wounded on the evening of 7 January in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. Shell casings found at the scene were later linked to the weapon carried by Coulibaly in his kosher supermarket attack.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;

The second shooting occurred in [[Montrouge]] on 8 January. Clarissa Jean-Philippe, an unarmed French policewoman, was killed, and a street sweeper was critically injured. DNA found at the scene was a match to Coulibaly.&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diondassanayake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/551314/Jewish-supermarket-siege-Paris-hero-hostage-tried-to-shot-Amedy-Coulibaly|title=Jewish supermarket siege: Heroic hostage executed after trying to turn weapon on gunman |author=Dion Dassanayake|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third shooting took place at [[Porte de Vincennes]], east Paris, on 9 January. Coulibaly killed four more people, all Jewish patrons at a Jewish [[Hypercacher]] supermarket at Porte de Vincennes, at the outset of an hours-long siege in which he demanded that the Kouachi brothers be freed.&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/11/french-authorities-hunt-most-wanted-woman-in-france-fears-new-terror-attack/|title=France's most wanted woman may have traveled to Syria, reports say|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBClive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-30722098|title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Manhunt – live reporting|publisher=BBC News|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.636178|title=Paris shooting updates / Charlie Hebdo attackers take hostage after car chase|date=9 January 2015|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/11/ce-que-l-on-sait-de-l-agression-d-un-joggeur-a-fontenay-aux-roses_4553732_3224.html Ce que l'on sait de l'agression d'un joggeur à Fontenay-aux-Roses] – ''Le Monde'' –  Emeline Cazi  – 11 January 2014 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/11/paris-gunman-amedy-coulibaly-allegiance-isis|title=Paris gunman Amedy Coulibaly declared allegiance to Isis|date=11 January 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of that attack, he introduced himself to his hostages, saying: "I am Amedy Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim.

==Aftermath==
After [[Mali]] refused to accept Coulibaly's body for burial, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Muslim section of a cemetery in [[Thiais]].&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/23/terrorist-buried-near-paris-after-mali-rejects-corpse/|title=Terrorist buried near Paris after Mali rejects corpse|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

There are '''apocryphal biographies''' in the first edition (1885–1900) of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (DNB), a major work on historical biography related to the [[United Kingdom]]. In other words, there is a biography that presents a life of a person asserted to have existed, but (in the light of later scholarship) the evidence for the person having lived has become regarded as tenuous or non-existent.

Examples are in [[:s:Category:Apocryphal biographies]], based on the updated ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (ODNB), where the corresponding article casts serious doubt on the DNB assertions.

==Kirkman Finlay==
'''Kirkman Finlay'''—supposed: (''c.'' 1802&amp;ndash;1828) was an alleged Scottish [[philhellene]].

The DNB has an article on this man,{{sfn|Goodwin|1889|p=32}} but more modern scholarship refutes its credibility. Monica Clough in the 21st century ODNB explains how the original source for the DNB probably confused fact with fiction and concludes by citing and quoting C. R. Fay (1951):
{{quote|
Perhaps, unless new evidence is found, more reliable than the obituary in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' of April 1828 which called him into being,{{sfn|Gentlemen's Magazine staff|1828|p=372}} 'the second quite imaginary Kirkman Finlay of the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] "who was neither killed in Greece nor born anywhere"' can be safely buried.|Monica Clough&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clough|2004}} citing C. R. Fay, Huskisson and his age (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Robert Bruce (died 1094?) ==
Robert de Brus [Bruce] supposed nobleman, based on late medieval lists of those who fought at Hastings,{{sfn|Mackay|1886|p=114}} which are wholly unreliable.{{sfn|Cownie |2004}}

==Macduff 'thane' of Fife==
"A half or wholly mythical personage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB |wstitle=Macduff |first=Thomas Finlayson |last=Henderson |volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; If he is not a literary invention, then he represents a supporter of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], descended from [[Dub, King of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Dauvit|last= Broun|title=Dubh  (d. 966)|id= 8166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biographical criticism''' is a form of [[literary criticism]] which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Criticism", ''Writing essays about literature: a guide and style sheet'' (2004), Kelley Griffith, University of North Carolina at Greensborough, Wadsworth Publishing Company , pages 177-178, 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25111810 Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism]" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Biographical criticism is often associated with [[historical-biographical criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/college_literature/v030/30.1knoper.html&lt;/ref&gt; a critical method that "sees a literary work chiefly, if not exclusively, as a reflection of its author's life and times".&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred L. Guerin, A handbook of critical approaches to literature, Edition 5, 2005, page 51, 57-61; Oxford University Press, University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

This longstanding critical method dates back at least to the [[Renaissance]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Duane Reed (1922) "Biographical Criticism of Vergil since the Renaissance" ''Studies in Philology'' 19(1): pp. 1-30, page 1 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and was employed extensively by Samuel Johnson in his ''[[Lives of the Poets]]'' (1779–81).&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism "Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets (1779–81) was the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism, the attempt to relate a writer's background and life to his works."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any critical methodology, biographical criticism can be used with discretion and insight or employed as a superficial shortcut to understanding the literary work on its own terms through such strategies as [[Formalism (literature)|Formalism]].  Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called [[New Critics]] of the 1920s, who coined the term "[[biographical fallacy]]"&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Francis Noel (1967) "The Keys Are at the Palace: A Note on Criticism and Biography" pp. 135-149 ''In'' Damon, Philip (editor)  (1967) ''Literary Criticism and Historical Understanding: Selected Papers from the English Institute'' Columbia University Press, New York, {{OCLC|390148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussed extensively in Frye, Herman Northrop (1947) ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey,  page 326 and following, {{OCLC|560970612}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature.

Notwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as [[John Steinbeck]],&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]]&lt;ref&gt;Knoper, Randall (2003)[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_200301/ai_n9212440/ "Walt Whitman and New Biographical Criticism"] ''College Literature'' 30(1): pp. 161-168&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, James (ed), ''Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays'' (1999),pp. 19-27, 40-43, 45, 47, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peripatetic biographical criticism ==
In ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism'', in a chapter titled "Peripatetic Biographical Criticism", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the [[Hellenistic]] age, "The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints".&lt;ref&gt;George Alexander Kennedy, The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism, page 205, Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of otherness ==
Jackson J. Benson describes the form as a "'recognition of 'otherness'—that there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader—appears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'"&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to other modes of criticism==
Biographical criticism shares in common with [[New Historicism]] an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to [[Romanticism]]. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a "universal" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.

== Assessments of biographical criticism and literary biography ==
In ''The Art of Literary Biography'' (1995), John Worthen writes:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;'The fact that we ''want'' an emergent sense of the inevitable development suggests the enormously soothing quality which biographies have come to have in our age. Not only do biographies suggest that things as difficult as human lives can – for all their obvious complexity – be summed up, known, comprehended: they reassure us that, while we are reading, a world will be created in which there are few or no unclear motives, muddled decisions, or (indeed) loose ends.'&lt;ref&gt;John Worthen, 'The Necessary Ignorance of a Biographer,' in John Batchelor (ed.) ''The Art of Literary Biography'', Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995 pp.227-244, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:STATUE OF BLONDELL NEAR DURNSTEIN IN THE WACHAU VALLEY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Statue of Blondel near [[Durnstein]]]]
'''Blondel de Nesle''' – either '''Jean I of Nesle''' (c. 1155 – 1202) or his son '''Jean II of Nesle''' (died 1241) – was a [[France|French]] [[trouvère]].

The name 'Blondel de Nesle' is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. He was identified in 1942, by [[Holger Dyggve]], as Jean II of Nesle (near [[Amiens]]), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the [[Fourth Crusade]]; he later fought in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. However, in 1994, [[Yvan Lepage]] suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the [[Third Crusade]], which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]].

If the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. (The melody of "L'amours dont sui espris" is used in ''[[Carmina Burana]]'', for the song "Procurans Odium"). His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times.

==Legend==
By 1260, Blondel's name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised ''Récits d'un Ménestrel de Reims''; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the [[minstrel]] Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king's escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at [[Dürnstein]]; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard's location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.

'Blondel' is a common [[surname]] on the [[Channel Island]] of [[Guernsey]]. It is recorded that King Richard granted a [[fief]] on the island to a [[vassal]] named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère.

==Modern versions==
The legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the [[Middle Ages]], but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Richard Coeur-de-lion (opera)|Richard Coeur-de-lion]]'' (1784). In 1822, [[Eleanor Anne Porden]] used the legend in her epic poem ''Cœur De Lion'': in her version, Blondel is really Richard's wife, [[Berengaria of Navarre]], in disguise.

A poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled Blondel's Lied was set to music by [[Robert Schumann]].

Throughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists,  placed a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. [[Norah Lofts]] in ''The Lute Player'' (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly ) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel's  heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard's neglected wife Berengaria. 

In the 1962–63 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] British television series ''[[Richard the Lionheart (TV series)|Richard the Lionheart]]'', Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by [[Iain Gregory]].

The English acoustic band of the early 1970s, [[Amazing Blondel]], was named after Blondel.

The legend inspired ''[[Blondel (musical)|Blondel]]'', a 1983 [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Stephen Oliver (composer)|Stephen Oliver]] and [[Tim Rice]]. The play, a comedic [[rock opera]], is set during the period of the [[Third Crusade]]. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director [[Patrick Wilde]] to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3344">The '''Blue Sky Rangers''' is a group of [[Intellivision]] game programmers who previously worked for [[Mattel]] in the early 1980s.

When the Intellivision first came out in 1978, its games were all developed by an outside firm, [[APh Technological Consulting]]. Realizing that potential profits are much greater with [[first party software]], Mattel formed its own in-house software development group. The original five members of that Intellivision team were manager [[Gabriel Baum]], [[Don Daglow]], [[Rick Levine]], [[Mike Minkoff]] and [[John Sohl]]. Levine and Minkoff (a long-time Mattel Toys veteran) both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team.  To keep these and later programmers (the Mattel team peaked at 110 people in 1983) from being hired away by rival [[Atari]], their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret.

In 1982, ''[[TV Guide]]'' published an article about Intellivision's secret programming team. The writer of the article wanted to come up with some group name other than "The Application Software Programmers," so he came up with the name "The Blue Sky Rangers." This was based on the programming group's "Blue Sky Meetings," which were a series of brainstorming sessions for new game ideas.&lt;ref name="TVGuide" /&gt;

This name stuck and the programmers were (and still are) collectively referred to as the Blue Sky Rangers. One of the early programmers, Keith Robinson, re-acquired the rights to Intellivision in recent years and the Blue Sky Rangers' games are now available on a variety of computers and video game platforms, as well as [[mobile phones]]. Rights are currently held by Tommy Tallarico.&lt;ref name="Techspot"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Video game music veteran Tommy Tallarico acquires Intellivision rights from Mattel | first = Jeffrey | last  = Cal | date  = May 29, 2018 | magazine = [[Techspot]] | url   = https://www.techspot.com/news/74844-video-game-music-veteran-tommy-tallarico-acquires-intellivision.html | accessdate = August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13666">{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon witnesses''' are a group of contemporaries of [[Joseph Smith]] who saw the [[golden plates]] from which Smith translated the [[Book of Mormon]]. The most significant witnesses are the [[Three Witnesses]] and the [[Eight Witnesses]], all of whom allowed their names to be used on two separate statements included with the Book of Mormon. Each of the witnesses never denied what they saw.

==Three Witnesses==
{{Main|Three Witnesses}}

The '''Three Witnesses''' were a group of three early leaders of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] who wrote in a statement of 1830 that an [[angel]] had shown them the [[golden plates]] from which [[Joseph Smith]] translated the [[Book of Mormon]] and that they had heard God's voice testifying that the book had been translated by the power of God.

The Three Witnesses were [[Oliver Cowdery]], [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], and [[David Whitmer]], whose joint testimony, in conjunction with a separate statement by [[Eight Witnesses]], has been printed with nearly every edition of the Book of Mormon since its first publication in 1830. All three witnesses eventually broke with Smith and were excommunicated from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|church]].&lt;ref&gt;"All three witnesses eventually quarreled with Joseph and left his church. At their going he heaped abuse upon them, but none ever denied the reality of his vision, and Cowdery and Harris eventually were rebaptized. Joseph had no fear in vilifying them; he neither expected nor received reprisals. For he had conjured up a vision they would never forget." {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, Joseph Smith called Cowdery, Harris, and Whitmer "too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them."&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Roberts, ed. ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1905), 3: 232.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839 Cowdery published a tract rejecting the Latter Day Saints and in 1840 become a member of the Methodist Protestant Church.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Shook. [http://www.solomonspalding.com/docs2/1914Shk1.htm#pg039a The true origin of the Book of Mormon] (Cincinnati: Standard Pub. Co., 1914), 49–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, all three testified to the divine origin of the Book of Mormon,{{fact|date=April 2017}} and near the end of their lives rejoined one denomination or another of the Latter Day Saint movement.{{fact|date=April 2017}} Harris and Cowdery rejoined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] shortly before their deaths,{{fact|date=April 2017}} and Whitmer founded the [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)]].{{fact|date=April 2017}}

}}

==Eight Witnesses==
{{Main|Eight Witnesses}}
The '''Eight Witnesses''' were the second of the two groups of "special witnesses" to the [[Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon's]] [[golden plates]]. They were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: [[Christian Whitmer]], [[Jacob Whitmer]], [[Peter Whitmer, Jr.]], [[John Whitmer]], [[Hiram Page]], [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], [[Hyrum Smith]], and [[Samuel Harrison Smith]].  Joseph Smith Sr. was Joseph's father, and Hyrum and Samuel H. Smith were his brothers.  Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were David Whitmer's brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lyman Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 79: "Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive....The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph—and God—answering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified they were shown the plates by [[Joseph Smith]] rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses. Christian Whitmer died in 1835 and his brother Peter Whitmer, Jr. died the following year. In 1838, the surviving Whitmers became estranged from Joseph Smith during a leadership struggle in [[Far West, Missouri]], and all were excommunicated with other dissenters,&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 337,339, 350–51. On June 17, [[Sidney Rigdon]] "preached a vitriolic sermon based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot....Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably [[Danites]] by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders....Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled." (355–51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[William E. M'Lellin]]. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should "write and keep a regular history" of the church (D&amp;C 47). Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, ''From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; never to rejoin Smith's church. None of the Eight Witnesses is known to have denied his testimony to the authenticity of Book of Mormon or the golden plates.

==Another witness==
{{main|Mary Whitmer}}

[[Mary Whitmer|Mary Musselman Whitmer]] (1778–1856), the mother of five Witnesses who took care of the household in [[Fayette, New York]], where much of the translation occurred, said that an angel showed her the plates and thus made her more content to continue her daily labors.&lt;ref&gt;"David Whitmer Interview with Edward Stevenson, 9 February 1888,"in [[Dan Vogel]], ''Early Mormon Documents'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2003), 5: 160–61; John C. Whitmer Interview with Andrew Jenson and Edward Stevenson, 11 October 1888," in ''EMD'' 5: 260–62.  John Whitmer said that his grandmother always referred to the supernatural visitor as "Brother Nephi."&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph Smith made no mention of this visitation in his journal.

==Responses==
===Criticism===

Critics of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]—from late nineteenth-century clergymen to [[Mark Twain]] to modern agnostics, evangelical Christians, and even some unorthodox ("Big Tent") Mormons—argue that the testimonies of the witnesses cannot be taken at face value.

* According to [[Grant Palmer]], the Book of Mormon witnesses had a "nineteenth-century magical mindset" rather than "a rationalist perspective." They believed in what was called "second sight.  Traditionally, this included the ability to see spirits and their dwelling places within the local hills and elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;[[Grant H. Palmer]], ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 175. Palmer devotes an entire chapter to the magical mindset of the Book of Mormon Witnesses.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of the witnesses possessed and used [[Scrying|seer stone]]s; Oliver Cowdery was a [[Dowsing|rodsman]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Michael Quinn, ''Early Mormonism and the Magic World View'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1998), rev. ed., 239-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Tufts University professor [[John L. Brooke]] has observed, many of the earliest Mormons were "very much attuned to the supernatural powers of witchcraft."&lt;ref&gt;John L. Brooke, ''The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644–1844'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Far removed from our own modern empiricism, the world view of the witnesses is difficult for us to grasp," and thus it is less impressive that "three signatories to the Book of Mormon saw and heard an angel."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 194-95.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the witnesses were family, close friends, or financial backers of Joseph Smith. Cowdery, Page, and the five Whitmers were related by marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] later joked, "I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Fawn Brodie, ''No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), second ed., 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although Harris continued to testify to the truth of the [[Book of Mormon]] even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he "seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience."&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Early Mormon Documents'', 2: 255. The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris "used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and 'seeing with the spiritual eye,' and the like." [[Pomeroy Tucker]], ''Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism'' (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1867), 71 in ''EMD'', 3: 122. John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the book, said that he had asked Harris, "Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?" According to Gilbert, Harris "looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye." John H. Gilbert, "Memorandum," 8 September 1892, in ''EMD'', 2: 548. Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with "the eye of faith" or "spiritual eyes." Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 &amp; 1828 in ''EMD'', 2: 270; Jesse Townsend to Phineas Stiles, 24 December 1833, in ''EMD'', 3: 22. In 1838, Harris is said to have told an Ohio congregation that "he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination." Stephen Burnett to Lyman E. Johnson, 15 April 1838 in ''EMD'', 2: 291. A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio, said that Harris "never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision." Reuben P. Harmon statement, c. 1885, in ''EMD'', 2: 385.&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Smith's death, [[James Strang]], claiming to be Smith's chosen successor, also produced [[Voree plates|buried plates]] and the testimony of eleven witnesses to their authenticity. All living witnesses to the Book of Mormon (except possibly Cowdery)—three of the Whitmers, Martin Harris, and Hiram Page—accepted at least briefly Strang's "leadership, angelic call, metal plates, and his translation of these plates as authentic."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 212-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apologetics===
* LDS church leaders and student manuals note that none of the witnesses ever denied his testimony as it was printed in the Book of Mormon nor denied that Smith was a true prophet at the time he translated the book.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Dallin H. Oaks]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1999/05/the-witness-martin-harris "The Witness: Martin Harris"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign'']], May 1999; [[James E. Faust]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/11/a-growing-testimony "A Growing Testimony"], ''Ensign'', November 2011; [[Henry B. Eyring]], [http://www.lds.org/liahona/2003/11/an-enduring-testimony-of-the-mission-of-the-prophet-joseph "An Enduring Testimony of the Witness of the Prophet Joseph"], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', November 2003;[http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-gospel-doctrine-teachers-manual/lesson-4-remember-the-new-covenant-even-the-book-of-mormon "Lesson 4: Remember the New Covenant, Even the Book of Mormon"], ''Doctrine and Covenants and Church History: Gospel Doctrine Teacher's Manual (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apologists note that after being excommunicated, Harris and Cowdery later returned to the church.&lt;ref&gt;A list of articles is available in the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research|FAIR]] Topical Guide, under [http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai109.html ''Book of Mormon Witnesses''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725072851/http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai109.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11972">A '''character arc''' is the transformation or inner journey&lt;ref name="Gerke"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[character (arts)|character]] over the course of a story. If a story has a character arc, the character begins as one sort of person and gradually transforms into a different sort of person in response to changing developments in the story. Since the change is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait (for example, from greed to benevolence), the geometric term ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' is often used to describe the sweeping change. In most stories, [[main character|lead characters]] and [[protagonist]]s are the characters most likely to experience character arcs,&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible for lesser characters to change as well.&lt;ref name="Gerke" /&gt; A driving element of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of many stories is that the main character seems initially unable to overcome opposing forces, possibly because they lack skills or knowledge or resources or friends. To overcome such obstacles, the protagonist must change, possibly by learning new skills, to arrive at a higher sense of self-awareness or capability. Protagonists can achieve such self-awareness by interacting with their environment, by enlisting the help of mentors, by changing their viewpoint, or by some other method.

==Dramatic narrative structure==
{{main|Dramatic structure}}
Throughout the trajectory of narratives with a tripartite structure, character arcs often unfold beside the narrative arc in the following way:

===First act===
During the first act, the character arc is established or re-established for at least one character, the main character (the protagonist), within the exposition (noument) of the environment including relationships to other characters. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident, known as the [[Inciting Incident|inciting incident]], or catalyst occurs that confronts the protagonist, whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first [[Climax (narrative)|turning point]].  After the first turning point, life will never be the same for the protagonist and raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the story. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, for example, Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?&lt;ref name=bible&gt;{{harvtxt|Trottier|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second act===
During the second act, also referred to as "[[rising action]]", the character arc develops as the protagonist attempts to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to discover ever-worsening situations, which often lead to the learning of new skills, the discovery of capabilities, and (sometimes late in the second act if at all) the raising of self-awareness.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

===Third act===
During the third act, including the climax, "[[falling action]]" and resolution (denouement), the narrative arc is completed although the character arc typically is not.  During the climax, because the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question is answered, a character arc reaches a place where the character gains a new sense of who they are becoming.  As the plot and its subplots resolve, the character arc's emphasis shifts from the learning of any new skills or the discovery of dormant capabilities to the awakening of a higher level of self-awareness, which in turn changes who the character is becoming.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== In literature ===
Some examples include:

* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' sees the eponymous character, once a young scholarly prince full of promise, quickly becoming a melancholic brooder after his father's death. The play shows his slow but deadly fall into madness.
* In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist [[Raskolnikov]] commits a murder, that leads him on a path of redemption, and after an intense inner struggle, he realizes that he needs to be punished for his actions, reporting himself to the authorities.
* [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'' includes a myriad of characters that transform against the backdrop of social events. [[Jean Valjean]] starts as a selfish, violent convict and develops into a generous and loving father to [[Cosette]], who in turn transforms from an abused, lonely and somewhat secluded child to a beautiful and caring woman.
* [[Ursula Le Guin]]'s protagonist from her ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' quartet gradually changes from an impulsive and arrogant youth to a stoic and wise man, reconciling the darkness within and all the bad actions it had caused.
* ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of books by [[George R.R. Martin]] shows numerous examples of complete character arcs. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] transforms from a naive young girl to a queen and a conqueror, only to fall from grace after a misuse of power. The character of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], undergoes a similar arc of embracing the need to govern and rule and metaphorically "kills the boy and lets the man be born" only to die after a misuse of power. Other characters such as [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Jaime Lannister]], start out as childish and petty, but once faced with the cruelty of the world, Jaime grows into a mature and wise leader, and Sansa grows into a strong-willed and poised lady.

=== In film ===
Some examples include:

* In ''[[Tootsie]]'', [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character begins as a [[misogynist]]ic [[chauvinist]] but when he is forced to play the part of a woman, he also experiences a change in how he views women and becomes a different character by the end.
* In ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', Jim begins as a carefree young boy.  After the Japanese take over [[Shanghai]] and he is separated from his family, he is forced to suffer trauma because of the war.
* In ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), widely regarded as one of the [[greatest films ever made]], Michael Corleone initially wants nothing to do with the crime business of his father, Don Vito Corleone. When Vito is critically injured in a shooting, however, Michael gradually becomes more involved in a war of retribution on those responsible. This, effectively and ironically, sets him down the path to becoming Don of the Corleone crime syndicate. Its acclaimed sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), chronicles Michael's effective fall from grace as a result of becoming a powerful crime lord.
* In ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), Travis Bickle degenerates from a somewhat disturbed, highly disorganized Vietnam war veteran into an obsessive psychotic.
* In ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), [[Henry Hill]] (played by [[Ray Liotta]]) goes from being a suave and sophisticated gangster to a paranoid nervous wreck due to a severe [[cocaine]] addiction.
* In ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]] begins the movie embracing her ice powers. After injuring her sister  [[Anna (Disney)|Anna]] she becomes scared of her powers and considers herself a monster. After her sister sacrifices herself, Elsa finally embraces her powers again. Anna begins the movie as a social butterfly willing to throw herself into any man's arms. After [[Hans (Disney)|Hans]] betrays her, Anna learns that looks can sometimes be deceiving.
*In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] begins a story arc dealing with accepting himself as one person rather than seeing Bruce Banner separate. It continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and will conclude in ''[[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers 4]]''.

=== In television ===
Like a [[story arc]], which often is composed of many [[dramatic structure|narrative arcs]], the character arc is not confined within the limits of one narrative.  The character arc may extend over to the next story, a [[sequel]], or another episode.  In episodic [[TV series]], the character arc functions as a [[narrative hook]] that writers often use to ensure viewers continue watching.

* The TV series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' made heavy use of character arcs throughout its run, with story arcs (or mysteries, as the show was famed for) normally being used to move the plot along in the background, as the four protagonists, [[Susan Mayer]], [[Lynette Scavo]], [[Bree Van de Kamp]], and [[Gabrielle Solis]], dealt with their various foibles and flaws, through the eyes of their dead friend and neighbour, [[Mary Alice Young]].
* Over the course of the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|1995|9}}), [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]] starts from a young, idealistic Greek farm girl to becoming a warrior, and in the end, she becomes [[Xena]]'s successor.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' focuses on character arcs for each of the survivors of a plane crash. [[Jack Shephard]] accepting his role as protector of the island, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] going from a self-centered con-man to a mature leader, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]'' discovering his destiny on the island.

* ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|2001|10}}) focuses on character arcs for each of its main characters as they progress into their ''[[Superman]]'' comic book identities. [[Clark Kent]]'s arc revolved around the gradual acceptance of his destiny and becoming a hero. The series also tracks [[Lex Luthor]]'s progression into darkness and [[Lois Lane]]'s emulation of her cousin [[Chloe Sullivan|Chloe]] as she becomes a hardened journalist. Other characters have their eventual character arc alluded to but never explicitly defined or realized onscreen, such as [[Perry White]]'s rise to editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and [[Lex Luthor]]'s ascension to [[President of the United States]]. As well as individual characters, there are arcs involving many characters which intertwine to tell about the formation of the [[Justice League]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*In ''[[Breaking Bad]],'' [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] begins as a high school chemistry teacher struggling with a serious illness while trying to support his family financially. His decision to become a manufacturer of addictive illegal drugs starts a downward spiral in which his wife, [[Skyler White]], divorces him, and his character ''arcs'' from a morally responsible regular guy into a dangerous monster.
* The teen drama series ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'' features two character arcs for its protagonist Clay Jensen: In the flashbacks, Clay begins as a shy young man until meeting [[Hannah Baker]]. In the present, after Hannah's death, he becomes emotionally withdrawn until listening to the tapes left behind by his former friend. After learning the truth, he becomes a warrior and a voice of justice for Hannah.

[[File:Coat of arms of Joseph Ratzinger.svg|thumb|right|250px|The coat of arms of Cardinal Ratzinger]]

The [[papal coats of arms|personal papal coat of arms]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was designed by Archbishop [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]] (who was later created a Cardinal) soon after the [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal election in 2005]].

==Shield==
The shape of the [[shield (heraldry)|shield]] varies from artist to artist. In the official rendering of the coat of arms of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] the shape chosen is that of a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]].

===Blazon===
The [[blazon]] (the written description, in terminology peculiar to heraldry, of the contents of the coat of arms) given on the Vatican [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html website] is as follows:
:''Gules, chape ployé Or, with the scallop shell Or; the dexter chape with a moor's head Proper, crowned and collared Gules, the sinister chape a bear trippant (*passant) Proper, carrying a pack Gules belted Sable.'
This means, in non-technical English:
: A red shield mantled in gold and with a gold scallop shell; the right (for the bearer of the shield, the left for the viewer) part of the mantle has the head of a moor in her natural colour (brown) wearing a red crown and red collar; the left part of the mantle has a walking bear in its natural colour (brown) carrying a red pack tied with black bands.

Note 1. A mantle outside the shield does not normally contain ''charges'' (an heraldic term for objects). Within the shield, as here, it is a religious symbol, and indicates ideals inspired in monastic spirituality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is also a reference to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]].

Note 2. The black bands tying the red pack is one of several existing contraventions of the heraldic [[rule of tincture]], which in general does not allow the placing of colour on colour or metal (gold or silver) on another metal.

===Charges===
The charges of the arms &amp;mdash; the [[Maure|Moor's head]], [[Corbinian]]'s bear, and [[scallop]] &amp;mdash; appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others.

====Scallop shell====
The symbolism of the [[scallop]] shell is multiple. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, "I am emptying the sea into this hole."  Thus did [[Augustine]] understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on ''The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church'', and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.

The scallop shell is also an allusion to the [[Sacrament]] of Holy [[Baptism]]. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life.

The shell also stands for [[pilgrimage]]. When topped with a [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shell]] a [[pilgrim's staff]], or "[[Jacob's staff]]", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle [[Saint James the Great]], and his sanctuary at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to "the pilgrim people of God", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the [[Second Vatican Council]] as ''[[peritus]]'' (theological adviser) to Cardinals [[Josef Frings]] of Cologne and [[Julius Döpfner]] of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology.

Finally, the [[pilgrimage]] [[symbol]]ism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. [[Pope Paul VI]]&amp;mdash;who created Joseph Ratzinger as a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1977&amp;mdash;was often called the "Pilgrim Pope" for his ground-breaking travels to the [[Holy Land]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Colombia]], the [[Philippines]], and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by [[Pope John Paul II]] with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy.

====Moor of Freising====
[[File:Hochstift Freising coat of arms.svg|right|150px|Moor's head of Freising, from the coat of arms of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Freising]].]]
The [[maure|Moor's head]] is a heraldic charge associated with [[Wörth, Upper Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. Typically facing to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (''[[dexter and sinister|dexter]]'' in heraldic terms) and depicted in natural brown colour ''caput Aethiopum'' (literally "Ethiopian head") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a [[Metropolitan Archdiocese]] with the name of München und Freising in 1818, subsequent to the [[Concordat]] between [[Pius VII]] and [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria]] (5 June 1817).

The Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], as well as in the [[blazons]] of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in [[German heraldry]] the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the [[Bavaria]]n tradition and is known as the ''caput Ethiopicum'' or the ''Moor of Freising''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110021140/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html |archivedate=2007-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corbinian's bear====
A legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint [[Corbinian]]'s pack [[horse]] was killed by a [[bear]]. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned        to Bavaria. The implication is that "[[Christianity]] tamed and domesticated the ferocity of [[paganism]] and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of [[Bavaria]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The bear and the scallop-shell &amp;mdash; a unique papal coat of arms | work=Catholic World News| url= http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=36801   | date =27 April 2005 | accessdate=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried.

==External ornaments==
[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|200px|The coat of arms of the Holy See.]]
[[File:Guardia Svizzera Bandiera.svg|thumb|right|200px|Banner of the Swiss Guard, with the coat-of-arms of Pope Benedict XVI modified to include the papal tiara.]]
Traditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth ({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}}). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
In Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver [[mitre]] with three gold stripes.&lt;ref name= "cns2005"&gt;{{cite news | last=Glatz | first=Carol  |  title=Pope drops papal crown from coat of arms, adds miter, pallium | date=2005-05-18 | publisher=Catholic News Service | url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502625.htm| accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stripes recall the three crowns of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Pallium===
The [[pallium]] with red crosses is also a new addition.&lt;ref name="cns2005"/&gt; It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration.

==Early controversy==
Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} have voiced objection to Pope Benedict's use of the mitre and pallium in his coat of arms, and the absence of the traditional [[papal tiara]].

Their arguments include:
* The use of mitres in the personal arms of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and [[bishop]]s was banned by an instruction of the Holy See in April 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church | title= Instruction on the Dress, Titles, and Coat-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops, and Lesser Prelates |url= http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm |publisher=Salvador Miranda via [[Florida International University|FIU]] | accessdate= 2012-03-23|date=April 17, 1969 | quote= 28. The use of coats-of-arms by Cardinals and Bishops is permitted. The shield of the coat-of-arms must be simple and clear. The use of the crozier and mitre in the coat-of-arms is suppressed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously a crozier and mitre were used as external ornaments, being placed behind the shield, beneath the clerical hat, the [[galero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sahw.bravehost.com/c-ecc.htm Ecclesiastical Heraldry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000802/http://sahw.bravehost.com/c-ecc.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An example of an episcopal coat-of-arms ensigned with mitre and crozier, curiously granted a few months ''after'' the official exclusion of these ornaments, is [http://www.sonasmor.net/CD23.html that of Bishop Colin A.

[[File:Rom - Vatikanische Gärten Papstwappen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pope's arms with a tiara, Vatican Garden]]
Regardless of the validity of such arguments, the Pope, as supreme legislator and interpreter of Church law,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6YCpraE-7xcC&amp;pg=PA71 John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, ''New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law''] (Paulist Press 2002 {{ISBN|9780809140664}}), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; had full authority to decide the form of his armorial bearings.

Some{{Specify|date=March 2012}} claimed that Benedict's arms could still properly be rendered with the tiara and keys and without the pallium. This was done in the Vatican gardens behind [[St. Peter's Basilica]], viewable from atop the dome. Shortly after the death of John Paul II, the contents of his shield were removed from the flowerbed, but the tiara was left in place.  After the [[Papal conclave, 2005|election of Benedict XVI]], the gardeners put the design of the new Pope's arms within the shield, but rather than digging up the flowers depicting the tiara and replacing them with a mitre design, they left the tiara in place and omitted the pallium.

==Later controversy==

In a 2013 interview, Cardinal [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]], designer of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426013511/http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |archivedate=26 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2013, [[Pope Francis]] adopted in his [[papal coat of arms]] the [[coat of arms]] and the [[motto]] that he used since his [[episcopal consecration]] in 1991, differenced following his election as [[Supreme Pontiff]].&lt;ref name="OR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | access-date=March 18, 2013 | language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges and field==
His [[coat of arms]] displays three [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] on a blue [[Field (heraldry)|field]]. In reference to Francis being a [[Jesuit]], the uppermost charge is the emblem of the [[Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; The emblem is composed of a  [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun radiant]], within which is the IHS [[christogram]] (a [[monogram]] of the [[Holy Name of Jesus]]) in red, with a red cross surmounting the H and three black nails below the H.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; 

Below the Jesuit emblem is an eight-pointed star, the [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|star]] being  a long-standing symbol of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], and a [[spikenard]] representing [[Saint Joseph]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VIS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-miserando-atque-eligendo | title=Pope Francis : "Miserando atque eligendo"... | publisher=[[Vatican Information Service]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= NCR/&gt; In [[Hispanic]] iconographic tradition Saint Joseph is often depicted with a branch of spikenard in his hand.&lt;ref name="OR2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=4 December 2016 | language=Italian}} "La stella, secondo l’antica tradizione araldica, simboleggia la Vergine Maria, madre di Cristo e della Chiesa; mentre il fiore di nardo indica San Giuseppe, patrono della Chiesa universale. Nella tradizione iconografica ispanica, infatti, San Giuseppe è raffigurato con un ramo di nardo in mano."&lt;/ref&gt; 

These charges appeared on Bergoglio's previous coat of arms displayed when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires|Archbishop of Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name= NCR&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope stresses simplicity, ecumenism in inaugural Mass plans |url= http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-stresses-simplicity-ecumenism-inaugural-mass-plans|newspaper= [[National Catholic Reporter]] |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as Pope the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of the star and the spikenard were elevated from ''Argent'' (silver) to ''Or'' (gold). The first version of the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|papal coat of arms]] published by the Vatican showed a five-pointed star from Bergoglio's previous one, but this was later amended to eight points; the representation of the spikenard was also slightly altered so it would resemble leaves rather than what appears to look like grapes.

==Blazon==

The Vatican has not yet published the official [[blazon]] of the arms, but an approximation has been made by John Hamilton Gaylor, as follows:
:''Azure on a Sun in Splendour Or the IHS Christogram ensigned with a Cross paty fitchy piercing the H Gules all above three Nails fanwise points to centre Sable, and in dexter base a Mullet of eight points and in sinister base a Spikenard flower Or.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wedvick of Jarlsby - Religious/Francis, H.

==External ornaments==
Traditionally, a [[Pope]]'s coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the Pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind in Heaven as on earth.&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}})&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis' arms maintain the keys, but replaced the tiara (as did his predecessor) with a [[mitre|triband mitre]]. 

The [[Papal Tiara|tiara]] and keys remain the symbol of the [[papacy]] and appear on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
[[File:BANDERA GUARDIA VATICA PANCHO.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Banner of the Pontifical Swiss Guard]] with Pope Francis' coat of arms]]
As with his [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|predecessor's personal arms]], Francis replaced the traditional [[papal triregnum]] by adopting a [[tincture (heraldry)|silver]] [[mitre]] with three gold bands. These bands allude to the papal tiara's three [[crown (headgear)|crown]]s, which came to represent the three powers of Orders, Jurisdiction, and Magisterium, all joining at the centre depicting unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Motto===
[[File:Coat of arms of Jorge Mario Bergoglio.svg|thumb|Coat of arms as Cardinal Bergoglio]]
Unusually, Francis also decided to retain his personal [[motto]]: ''Miserando atque eligendo''. It is taken from the 21st [[homily]] of [[Bede|Saint Bede]], which is on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and refers to the [[vocation]] of [[Saint Matthew]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; He writes:

:"Vidit ergo Iesus publicanum et quia '''miserando atque eligendo''' vidit, ait illi 'Sequere me'." (Om. 21; CCL 122, 149-151)
:"Jesus saw the tax collector and, because '''he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him''', he said to him: Follow me." (trans. ''[[Liturgy of the Hours]]'' 1975, p. 1418)

Bede is here discussing Matthew 9:9-13. The salient point is that Jesus chose Matthew as his disciple not in spite but because of his being a sinner. In the Douay Rheims translation: 
&lt;ol start=9&gt;&lt;li&gt; And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The statement from the Vatican announcing the Pope's coat of arms and motto explained that the phrase had a special meaning for Francis as he felt it recalled his own vocation, when at the age of 17, he went to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] on St Matthew's day in 1953.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;

The [[blazon]] of the '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Princess of Asturias]]''' is given by a Royal Decree 979 on 30 October 2015 which was an amendment of the Royal Decree 1511 dated [[Madrid]] 21 January 1977, which also created her guidon (military personal ensign) and her standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boletín Oficial del Estado|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/10/31/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-11729.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official blazon==

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[Gules]] a castle three-towered [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], masoned [[Sable]] ajoure, (door and windows) [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[Argent]] a lion rampant Purpure crowned Or, armed Gules and crowned Or, for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, Or four pallets Gules, for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, Gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains all linked Or, an emerald Proper, for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];
*''Enté en point'', Argent a pomegranate Proper seeded Gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]], for [[Granada]];
*[[Inescutcheon]], Azure with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, [[bordure]]d Gules, for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].

The whole is differenced by a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points Azure, the [[brisure|difference]] used by heirs apparent to the [[House of Habsburg|Spanish House of Habsburg]].

The shield is surmounted by a closed crown, which is a circle of gold, inset with precious stones of their colours, composed of eight rosettes of acanthus leaves, of which five are visible, interspersed by pearls in their colour, issuing from which are four pearl diadems, of which three are visible, which converge in a blue orb, with gold semi-meridian and equator, surmounted by a gold cross, the crown lined with red and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]].

&lt;!--The following is unsourced:== Variants ==

Before 2001, the heir to the Spanish throne used this coat of arms unofficially, and still does in Aragon or Navarre, where a different version of the coat of arms, as Prince or Princess of Girona and Viana respectively, is displayed. It is likely that these arms will also be some day adopted officially.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera Sánchez, Alfonso (2010).

Allen]] and [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] about the nine justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], most of whom were over the age of 70 at the time; meanwhile, the Disney nine were all in their twenties.  (In turn, the U.S. Supreme Court was targeted as dominated by very old men by the proposed [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]], whose enactment was allegedly averted by [[the switch in time that saved nine]].)|group=Note}}  All members of the group are now dead.  [[John Lounsbery]] was the first to die, in 1976 from heart failure, and the last survivor was [[Ollie Johnston]], who died in 2008 from natural causes.  All have been acknowledged as [[Disney Legends]].

==Members==
*'''[[Les Clark]]''' (November 17, 1907&amp;nbsp;– September 12, 1979), who joined Disney in 1927. His specialty was animating [[Mickey Mouse]] as he was the only one of the Nine Old Men to work on that character from its origins with [[Ub Iwerks]]. Les did many scenes throughout the years, animating up until ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''. He moved into directing and made many animated featurettes and shorts.
*'''[[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]]''' (March 30, 1913&amp;nbsp;– January 12, 2000) started in 1935 on ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'', and later he went on to develop/animate the characters of Bambi and Thumper (in ''[[Bambi]]''), [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], [[Aurora (Disney)|Aurora]] and the raven (in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''), and [[Cruella de Vil]] (in ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]''). Davis was responsible for character design for both the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] and [[Haunted Mansion]] attractions at [[Disneyland]].
*[[File:Frankandollie.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] (center) with best friend [[Ollie Johnston]] and their wives in 1985]] '''[[Ollie Johnston]]''' (October 31, 1912&amp;nbsp;– April 14, 2008), who joined Disney in 1935, first worked on ''Snow White''. He went on to author the animator's bible ''[[The Illusion of Life]]'' with Frank Thomas. His work includes Mr. Smee (in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''), the Stepsisters (in ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), the District Attorney (in ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''), and Prince John (in ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''). According to the book ''The Disney Villain'', written by Johnston and Frank Thomas, Johnston also partnered with Thomas on creating characters such as Ichabod Crane (in ''The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad'') and Sir Hiss (in ''Robin Hood'').
*'''[[Milt Kahl]]''' (March 22, 1909&amp;nbsp;– April 19, 1987) started in 1934 working on ''Snow White''. His work included heroes such as [[Pinocchio]] (in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''), Tigger (in ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''), Peter Pan (in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''), and Slue-Foot Sue (in ''[[Melody Time]]'') and villains such as Madam Mim (in [[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]), [[Shere Khan]] (in ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''), Edgar the butler (in ''[[The Aristocats]]''), the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] (in ''Robin Hood''), and [[Madame Medusa]] (in ''[[The Rescuers]]'').
*'''[[Ward Kimball]]''' (March 4, 1914&amp;nbsp;– July 8, 2002) joined Disney in 1934. His work includes Jiminy Cricket (in ''Pinocchio''), Lucifer, Jaq and Gus (in ''Cinderella''), and the [[Mad Hatter]] and [[Cheshire Cat]] (in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''). His work was often more 'wild' than the other Disney animators and was unique. In 1968 he created and released a non-Disney anti-Vietnam War animated short, [[Escalation (animated short)|''Escalation'']].
*'''[[Eric Larson]]'''  (September 3, 1905&amp;nbsp;– October 25, 1988) joined in 1933. One of the top animators at Disney, he animated notable characters such as Peg in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''; the Vultures in ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''; Peter Pan's flight over London to Neverland (in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''); and Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear (in ''[[Song of the South]]''). Because of Larson's demeanor and ability to train new talent, Larson was given the task to spot and train new animators at Disney in the 1970s. Many of the top talents at Disney today were trained by Eric in the '70s and '80s.
* '''[[John Lounsbery]]''' (March 9, 1911&amp;nbsp;– February 13, 1976) started in 1935 and, working under Norm 'Fergy' Ferguson, quickly became a star animator. Lounsbery, affectionately known as 'Louns' by his fellow animators, was an incredibly strong draftsman who inspired many animators over the years. His animation was noted for its squashy, stretchy feel. Lounsbery animated J. Worthington Foulfellow and Gideon in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''; Ben Ali Gator in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''; George Darling in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''; Tony, Joe, and some of the dogs in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''; Kings Stefan and Hubert in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''; The Elephants in ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''; and many others. In the 1970s, Louns was promoted to Director and co-directed ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'' and his last film, ''[[The Rescuers]]''.
* '''[[Wolfgang Reitherman]]''' (June 26, 1909&amp;nbsp;– May 22, 1985) joined Disney in 1935 as an animator and director. He produced all the animated Disney films after Walt's death until his retirement; In the 1950s, Reitherman was promoted as a director. He also directed a sequence in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' which featured Prince Phillip's escape from [[Maleficent]]'s castle and his eventual battle against her as a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Some of his work includes Monstro (in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''), The Headless Horseman (in ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''), the Crocodile (in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''), and the Rat (in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'').
*'''[[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]]''' (September 5, 1912&amp;nbsp;– September 8, 2004) joined Disney in 1934. He went on to author the animator's bible ''The Illusion of Life'' with Ollie Johnston. His work included the wicked Stepmother (in ''Cinderella''), the Queen of Hearts (in ''Alice in Wonderland''), and Captain Hook (in ''Peter Pan''). Frank also was responsible for the iconic spaghetti scene in Lady and the Tramp.

==History==
By the time ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' was released, only four of the Nine Old Men (Kahl, Lounsbery, Thomas, and Johnston) were still animating at Disney, although Eric Larson was still working for Disney as a talent scout and trainer, Wolfgang Reitherman was by then directing and producing films, and Marc Davis was helping to create Disney theme park attractions. Lounsbery died in 1976, Kahl retired the same year and died in 1987. Thomas, Johnston and Davis retired in 1978, and Thomas and Johnston later enjoyed cameos in the [[Brad Bird]]-directed films ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' ([[Warner Bros.]], 1999) and ''[[The Incredibles]]'' ([[Pixar]], 2004). Thomas died shortly afterwards in 2004, and Johnston, who was by then the last surviving "Old Man", died in 2008.

As well as being honored as Disney Legends in 1989, all of the Nine Old Men were separately honored with the [[Winsor McCay Award]] (the lifetime achievement award for animators) during the 1970s and 1980s.

As part of their work for Disney, the Nine Old Men refined the [[12 basic principles of animation]]:
# [[Squash and stretch]]
# [[Anticipation (animation)|Anticipation]]
# Staging
# Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose
# [[Follow Through and Overlapping Action]]
# Slow In and Slow Out
# Arcs
# Secondary Action
# Timing
# [[Exaggeration]]
# Solid Drawing
# Appeal

Another important component of the Nine Old Men's legacy are the many animators in the contemporary animation industry who can directly or indirectly trace their training to someone who was either their apprentice at Disney Animation or their student at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]].  For example, Wayne Unten, the supervising animator for [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]] in Disney's ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', has noted that he apprenticed with John Ripa, who in turn apprenticed with [[Glen Keane]], who in turn apprenticed with Johnston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes|first1=Robert|title=CSUF alum turned Disney animation artist sneak peaks [''sic''] latest film|url=http://www.dailytitan.com/2013/10/csuf-alum-turned-disney-animation-artist-sneak-peaks-latest-film/|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=The Daily Titan|publisher=CSU Fullerton|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, as depicted by [[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470]]
A '''dragonslayer''' is a person or being that slays [[dragon]]s. Dragonslayers and the creatures they hunt have been popular in traditional stories from around the world: they are a type of story classified as type 300 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]]. They continue to be popular in modern books, films, video-games and other entertainments. Dragonslayer-themed stories are also sometimes seen as having a [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaoskampf]] theme - in which a heroic figure struggles against a monster that epitomises chaos.

==Description==
[[Image:Paul Gustave Dore Andromeda.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] Chained to a Rock'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1869).]]

A dragonslayer is often the hero in a "[[Princess and dragon]]" tale. In this type of story, the dragonslayer kills the dragon in order to rescue a high-class female character from being devoured by it. This female character often then becomes the love interest of the account. One notable example of this kind of legend is the story of [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Loðbrók]], who slays a giant serpent, thereby rescuing the maiden, [[Þóra borgarhjörtr]], whom he later marries.

There are, however, several notable exceptions to this common motif. In the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], for example, Saint George overcomes the dragon as part of a plot which ends with the conversion of the dragon's grateful victims to Christianity, rather than Saint George being married to the rescued princess character.

In a Norse legend from the [[Völsunga saga]], the dragonslayer, [[Sigurd]], kills [[Fafnir]] - a dwarf who has been turned into a dragon as a result of guarding the cursed ring that had once belonged to the dwarf, [[Andvari]]. After slaying the dragon, Sigurd drinks some of the dragon's blood and thereby gains the ability to understand the speech of birds. He also bathes in the dragon's blood, causing his skin to become invulnerable. Sigurd overhears two nearby birds discussing the heinous treachery being planned by his companion, [[Regin]]. In response to the plot, Sigurd kills Regin, thereby averting the treachery. &lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (1990). Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sigurd the Dragon Slayer. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-23285-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythologists such as [[Joseph Campbell]] have argued that dragonslayer myths can be seen as a psychological metaphor:&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But as Siegfried [Sigurd] learned, he must then taste the dragon blood, in order to take to himself something of that dragon power. When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood, he hears the song of nature. he has transcended his humanity and re-associated himself with the powers of nature, which are powers of our life, and from which our minds remove us.

...Psychologically, the dragon is one's own binding of oneself to one's own ego."
&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Facebook real-name policy controversy''' refers to the controversy over [[Social networking service|social networking]] site [[Facebook]]{{'}}s "[[real-name system]]" dictating how people register their accounts and configure their [[user profile]]s.  The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be "fake", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have "too many words", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.

== Background ==
The social networking website [[Facebook]] has maintained the [[real-name system]] policy for user profiles.  According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise per this policy, a "real name" is defined by "your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apologizes-for-real-name-policy-2014-10|title=Facebook Apologizes For 'Real Name' Policy That Forced Drag Queens To Change Their Profiles|last=Levy|first=Karyne|date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83&amp;nbsp;million Facebook accounts are fake accounts.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook: About 83 million accounts are fake |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-08-03/cnbc-facebook-fake-accounts/56759964/1 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook share price slumps below $20 amid fake account flap |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has asserted that "authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person."&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt;

==Affected users==

===Ethnic groups===

====Native Americans====
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still suspending Native Americans over 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/facebook-real-name-policy-suspends-native-americans|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Robin Kills The Enemy, a resident of the [[Sioux]] Rosebud reservation in South Dakota, found that when she tried to register her surname in its normal format, the site would not let her use them, so she resorted to combining the three words, spelling them as one word.  After having been a member for some time, she eventually contacted the site in an attempt to have her surname spelled as it actually is in real life.  However, after reaching out to Facebook, they instead deactivated her account without explanation.  When she was finally able to make contact with an actual employee, they wrote back telling her "Fake names are a violation of our Terms of Use. Facebook requires users to provide their full first and last names".  She eventually managed to have her account reinstated; however, users with the surname Kills The Enemy are, as of 2015, still required by Facebook to spell their surname without spaces as a single word.&lt;ref name=ictmn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Nestor|title=Facebook no friend to American Indian names |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/02/16/facebook-no-friend-american-indian-names-82895|website=Indian Country Today media network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shane Creepingbear, an Oklahoman member of the [[Kiowa]] tribe, reported that he had been "kicked off" of Facebook on [[Columbus Day]] for having a supposedly fake name.&lt;ref name=metroCreepingbear&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAteer|first1=Ollie|title=Native Americans booted off Facebook for having ‘fake’ names like Creepingbear|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/11/native-americans-booted-off-facebook-for-having-fake-names-like-creepingbear-5057955/|website=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lance Brown Eyes, an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]], found that his account had been suspended; when he was able to send in documentation to Facebook proving his identity, Facebook reinstated his account, but changed his name to "Lance Brown".&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russon|first1=Mary-Ann|title=Facebook fail: Native Americans keep being accused of using fake names|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/facebook-fail-native-americans-keep-being-accused-using-fake-names-1487378|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dana Lone Hill, a member of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe who had been a registered Facebook user for several years, discovered one day that she had been locked out of her account.  A message from Facebook said "it looks like the name on your Facebook account may not be your authentic name".  After a week, during which she had to send in her personal documentation to Facebook, her account access was restored.  She has since threatened a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Native Americans against Facebook due to how it exercises its name policies.

A number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip| first1=Abby| title=Online ‘authenticity’ and how Facebook's ‘real name’ policy hurts Native Americans | date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2015|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/10/online-authenticity-and-how-facebooks-real-name-policy-hurts-native-americans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a [[class action lawsuit]] against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Native American activist to sue Facebook over site's 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/19/native-american-activist-facebook-lawsuit-real-name|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====
In 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her [[Yoda_(disambiguation)|surname]], which is common in Japan, being confused with a [[Star Wars]] character of the [[Yoda|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2632170/Woman-called-Yoda-blocked-from-Facebook.html|title=Woman called Yoda blocked from Facebook|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=27 August 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish====
The [[Dublin]] branch of the [[Irish language]] rights group, Misneach, started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/protest-at-dublin-facebook-hq-over-real-name-policy-1.2345414 |title=Protest at Dublin Facebook HQ over ‘real-name’ policy |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 9, 2015 |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Gaelic====
In 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wins Facebook battle over ‘fake’ Gaelic name|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/man-wins-facebook-battle-over-fake-gaelic-name-1-3702815|date=26 February 2015|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chamoru====
In the Spanish-influenced indigenous [[Chamoru]] culture of the [[Marianas]], the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's [[maiden name]] as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that "Names can't have too many words." Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.

In cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that "Profile names can't have too many periods.") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being "Mary Dlg Mafnas". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.

====Vietnamese====
In January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being "false and misleading".&lt;ref name=BBCBich&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34897404|title=Phuc Dat Bich: Australian with 'misleading' name thanks supporters|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to "Phoo Da Bi" (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|{{ipa|/fukp˦˥ ɗat˩ ɓic˦˥/}}]]).&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was "glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous".&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; Subsequently "Phuc Dat" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phuc Dat Bich admits hoax in Facebook name battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34918491|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tamils====
Tamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bumpahead.net/tamil-name-structure-10dd63730563|title=Tamil name structure… |author=moulee|date=19 July 2009|publisher=bumpahead.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facebook-should-scrap-its-regressive-real-names-policy/article7797302.ece|title=Really harassed by Facebook’s ‘real names’|author=G. Sampath|date=24 October 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender users===
Facebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s used by the [[transgender]] community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-25/business/20872135_1_accounts-with-fake-names-facebook-facebook-guidelines-and-features|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Barbara|last=Ortutay|date=May 25, 2009|title=Real users caught in Facebook fake-name purge|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user via the anonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app [[Secret (app)|Secret]] began reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the [[stage name]]s of [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still freezing accounts despite apology to drag queens over 'real names.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/facebook-still-freezing-accounts-despite-apology-drag-queens-real-names|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03|title=My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not use on the site|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|author=Zip|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/28/woman-responsible-for-facebook-gender-options-kicked-off-for-violating-real-names-policy/|title=Woman responsible for Facebook gender options kicked off for violating real names policy|date=June 28, 2015|first=Naith|last=Payton|publisher=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.{{Better source|date=March 2015|reason=Daily Dot.  This is an opinion piece.

On October 1, 2014, [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]], Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.&lt;ref name="chriscoxpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543|title=Chris Cox - I want to apologize to the affected community of drag...|last=Cox|first=Chris|date=October 1, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Users target of religious persecution ===
Secular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger [[Raif Badawi]] in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abdullah-sharif/pakistans-religious-extremism_b_9577338.html|title=Pakistan's Religious Extremism: A World Menace|first=Abdullah|last=Sharif|date=1 April 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
International non-profit [[digital rights]] group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stated they were "alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community |title=Facebook's 'Real Name' Policy Can Cause Real-World Harm for the LGBTQ Community |last1=Kayyali |last2=York |first1=Nadia |first2=Jillian |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online magazine]] ''[[Queerty]]'' called Facebook's policy "a frankly creepy overreach of authority", adding "There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place."&lt;ref name="Queerty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queerty.com/facebook-targeting-drag-queens-forcing-them-to-use-their-legal-names-20140911 |title=Facebook Targeting Drag Queens, Forcing Them To Use Their Legal Names |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 11, 2014 |work=[[Queerty]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: "If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone…  FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://0zymandius.wix.com/magemagazine#!September-18-The-Day-F-Book-killed-the-King-Part-1/c112t/55fc2bae0cf256c0bf936f60|title=The Day F Book killed the King : Part 1|date=September 18, 2015|first=Ian|last=Thomson|magazine=MAGE Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag performer]] Olivia LaGarce started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] titled "Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!"&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Stranger"/&gt;

== Compromise to protect those with special circumstances  ==
On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/|title=Community Support FYI: Improving the Names Process on Facebook |last1=Osofsky |first1=Jason |last2=Gage |first2=Todd |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Facebook Newsroom |publisher=Facebook |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-modifies-real-names-policy-testing-use-of-assumed-names-1.2702400 |title=Facebook modifies 'real names' policy, testing use of assumed names |last=AFP |date=December 16, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/15/facebook-change-controversial-real-name-policy?subid=17310058&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2 |title=Facebook changes controversial 'real name' policy in wake of criticism  |last1=Holpuch |first1=Amanda |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem|title=Changes to Facebook’s "Real Names" Policy Still Don’t Fix the Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790?helpref=related|title=What other names are allowed on Facebook?|publisher=Facebook|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flags of the Dutch royal family''' are a set of flags used to identify a member of the royal family. The current system of flags for the Dutch monarch, princes, and princesses was introduced in 1908.

== Background ==
The current system of personal flags for the monarch and other members of the royal family was introduced in 1908. In 1907, minor modifications were introduced to the Dutch coat of arms; likewise, a new flag for the Dutch monarch was introduced the following year. These flags are designed by the High Council of Nobility (who are also responsible for heraldry of the royal family) and are granted by royal decree. Like their coats of arms, these flags are usually shared among siblings.

The flags follow a similar pattern and, although not [[banner of arms|banners of arms]], are heavily influenced by heraldry. Flags of those born into the royal family feature a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field, while the colours are reversed for those who marry into the family. Males have near-square flags while those of females are swallowtailed. Elements of an individual's family coat of arms are also incorporated into the flags.

== Use ==
The flags are used to mark the presence of an individual in certain buildings, when on vehicles (e.g. a car or ship), or in an army unit. The flag of the monarch is flown above [[Huis ten Bosch Palace]] in [[The Hague]] (the king's private residence) and above [[Noordeinde Palace]] in The Hague (the king's official residence) when the monarch is in the Netherlands, but not necessarily when he is actually resident. Besides these two residences, the royal standard is flown above other palaces, castles or estates where and when the King is actually staying.

The flags are never flown at half-mast; during a period of mourning, a black [[pennon]] is affixed to the flagpole flying the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal flags|url=https://www.royal-house.nl/topics/flags/personal-flags|website=www.royal-house.nl|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal standard ==
The '''royal flag''' ({{lang-nl|koninklijke vlag}}), or the '''royal standard''' of the [[Netherlands]], is the official flag of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarch]]. This flag is a non-personal distinctive flag and is not changed from reign to reign. The current flag, introduced in 1908, is a square [[orange (colour)|orange]] flag, divided in four quarters by a nassau-blue [[cross]]. These colours refer to the principality of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] (in [[France]]) and the principality of [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] (in [[Germany]]) from which the present royal family originates. 

In the centre of the flag is the lesser [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|coat of arms of the Kingdom]] (which originates as a composite of features taken from the arms of the [[house of Nassau]] and the [[Dutch Republic Lion|arms of the Dutch republic]]) surmounted by a [[Crown (headgear)|royal crown]] and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the [[Military William Order]]. Each quarter shows a bugle-horn which originates in arms of the principality of Orange.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Upon the accession of King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] in 2013, the monarch's flag was slightly modified: Instead of a rosette, a bow is placed in the ribbon of the Military William Order. Furthermore, the tassels on the horns now both hang down. The adjustments were applied on 30 April 2013 immediately after Willem-Alexander taking office.

==Princes==
The flag of a Dutch prince is rectangular in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princes born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field. 

Instead of the hunting horn of Orange in the upper right and the lower left quarters found in the monarch's flag, these are replaced with figures obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the prince's parent who married into the royal family. 

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed within an orange circle which replaces the center of the cross.

However, the left portion of a princesse's flag contains the usual hunting horn of Orange and personal figure (obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the princess's parent who married into the royal family) in the upper and lower left quarters of the flag respectively.

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed either within an orange circle which replaces the center of a blue cross, or at the centre of an orange cross.

==Consorts==
In general, the standard of a prince consort of the Netherlands is a rectangular flag with proportions 5:6 with the colours of the royal standard (i.e. the orange field and blue cross) reversed. The upper left and lower right quarters bear the lion from the Dutch coat of arms (holding arrows in one hand and brandishing a sword on the other) while the other two quarters have a personal figure taken from their personal coat of arms.

In general, the standard of a queen consort, or the wife of a prince of the Netherlands, is a flag in the form of a swallow tail. The two right quarters are empty, the upper left corner bears the orange horn taken from the arms of the Principality of Orange and the lower left quarter has a personal figure, taken from their personal coat of arms.

In both cases, the coat of arms of the kingdom is at the center of the cross.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">'''Generación del 51''' is a designation for one of a series of "generations" of Spanish composers, identifying a group born between 1924 and 1938.

Members of this group of composers from the Basque and Castilian-speaking regions of Spain include {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}:
*[[Carmelo Bernaola|Carmelo Alonso Bernaola]] (1929–2002)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Miguel Alonso (composer)|es|3=Miguel Alonso Gómez|lt=Miguel Alonso}} (1925–2002)
*[[Angel Arteaga]]
*[[Cristóbal Halffter]] (b. 1930)

*[[Agustín Bertomeu]] (b. 1929)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Amando Blanquer|es|3=Amando Blanquer Ponsoda}} (1935–2005)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Francisco Calés|es|3=Francisco Calés Otero}} (1925–1985)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Manuel Castillo|es}} (1930–2005)
*[[Juan José Falcón Sanabria]] (b. 1936)
*[[Antón García Abril]] (b. 1933)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Agustín González Acilu|es}} (b. 1929)
*[[Juan Hidalgo Codorniu|Juan Hidalgo]] (b. 1927)
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Ángel Oliver|es|3=Ángel Oliver Pina}} (1937–2005)
*[[Luis de Pablo]] (b. 1930)
*[[Claudio Prieto]] (b. 1934)
In their earlier works, members of this generation tended toward the avant-garde, with post-Webernian [[serialism]] evident in the work of Halffter and Luis de Pablo in particular. By the end of the 1970s a mellowing of their language becomes apparent, and during the 1980s many of them began to turn to [[tonality]] of one sort or another {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}. 

The Catalan members of this generation are associated with the reforming and renewing tendencies that emerged after the post-Civil War isolation ({{harvnb|Gómez|2001}}; {{harvnb|Perez Castillo|2001}}):
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Xavier Benguerel i Godó|ca}} (b. 1931)
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Joan Guinjoan Gispert|ca}} (b. 1931)
* [[Josep Mestres Quadreny]] (b. 1929)
* [[Josep Soler i Sardà]] (b. 1935)
Soler's compositional palette involves serial techniques, and he is particularly noted for his dramatic music {{harv|Perez Castillo|2001}}.

==Narrative==
At the beginning of the tale, the eponymous [[Math fab Mathonwy]] will die if his feet are not always held in the lap of a virgin or he is at war; Goewin is the virgin who performs this duty until Math is tricked into going to war by his nephews [[Gwydion]] and [[Gilfaethwy]], who proceed to [[rape]] Goewin. Once Math returns, Goewin reveals the crime and Math punishes the two by transforming them into a series of animals. He then marries Goewin, giving her power over his kingdom, in order to make amends.&lt;ref name="undefined"&gt;https://druidnetwork.org/what-is-druidry/deity-and-mythology/mythology/welsh-mythology/goewin &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam}}
The [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], specified ten of his [[Sahabah|companions]] who were promised paradise. Those companions named in this hadith are referred to as '''The Ten With Glad Tidings Of Paradise''' ({{lang-ar|العشرة المبشرون بالجنة}}; ''al-`Asharaa al-Mubasharûn bi-l-Janna'').

==The Hadith==

{{Quote|Narrated [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]]:&lt;br&gt;that the Messenger of Allah said: "[[Abu Bakr]] is in Paradise, '[[Umar]] is in Paradise, '[[Uthman]] is in Paradise, '[[Ali]] is in Paradise, [[Talhah]] is in Paradise, [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Az-Zubair]] is in Paradise, '[[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]] is in Paradise, [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas|Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas]] is in Paradise, [[Sa'id ibn Zayd]] is in Paradise, and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu 'Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah]] is in Paradise."|Collected by [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]]|''[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/urn/636260|title=Hadith - Chapters on Virtues - Jami` at-Tirmidhi - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|author=|date=|website=sunnah.com|accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Muslim view==
[[Muslim]]s put different weight on this hadith, the majority of the [[Sunni]]s, viewing it as very favourable whilst the [[Shia|Shiites]] dismmissed it in its entirety.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
This hadith was narrated in three collections by Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood, and [[Ibn Majah]].

The Sunni collection of hadith, called the ''[[Kutub al-Sittah]]'' (six major hadith collections), includes: ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', ''Sunan Abu Dawood'', ''[[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]]'', ''Jami` at-Tirmidhi'' and ''[[Sunan ibn Majah]]''. ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and ''Sahih Muslim'' are considered the most reliable of these collections.&lt;ref&gt;Muqaddimah Ibn al-Salah, pg. 160 Dar al-Ma’aarif edition; al-Tirmithi, under #3748; al-Tirmithi, Volume 5, Page 605, Hadith 3748; Abu Daoud, #4649 and #4650&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnis say that Muhammad's companions were sorted into twelve groups and of these the ten promised paradise were ranked first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html Twelve Ranks of the Companions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423065308/http://www.caliphtv.com/files/khalid.bin.waleed/khalid/companions.html |date=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banners of Knights of the Thistle.jpg|250px|thumb|Banners of [[Knights of the Thistle]] displayed in [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]]]

In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a '''heraldic flag''' is a [[flag]] containing [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[heraldic badge]]s, or other devices used for personal identification. 

Heraldic flags include '''banners, standards, pennons''' and their variants, '''gonfalons''', '''guidons''', and '''pinsels'''.  Specifications governing heraldic flags vary from country to country, and have varied over time. 

==Types of heraldic flags==

===Pennon===
{{main article|Pennon}}
The pennon is a small elongated flag, either pointed or swallow-tailed (when swallow-tailed it may be described as a [[banderole]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}). It was charged with the [[heraldic badge]] or some other armorial ensign of the owner, and displayed on his own lance, as a personal ensign. The ''pennoncelle'' was a modification of the pennon.&lt;ref name="Boutell"&gt;{{harvnb|Boutell|1914|pp=246-251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Scots usage, the pennon is four feet long. It tapers either to a point or to a rounded end as the owner chooses. It is assigned by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] to any armiger who wishes to apply for it.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"&gt;{{harvnb|''lyon-court.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banner===
{{main article|Banner of arms}}
[[File:Funeral Elisabeth.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Heraldic banners at the funeral of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The queen's casket is escorted by mourners bearing the banners of her ancestors' arms marshalled with the arms of their wives.&lt;ref&gt;From a manuscript of 1603.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[banner of arms]] (also simply called ''banner'') is square or oblong and larger than the pennon, bearing the entire coat of arms of the owner, composed precisely as upon a shield but in a square or rectangular shape.&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

{{quote|In the olden time, when a Knight had distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry, it was the custom to mark his meritorious conduct by prompt advancement on the very field of battle. In such a case, the point or points of the good Knight’s Pennon were rent off, and thus the ... small Flag was reduced to the square form of the Banner, by which thenceforth he was to be distinguished|- Charles Boutell, ''The Handbook to English Heraldry''&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;}}

The banners of members of [[Order of chivalry|Orders of Chivalry]] are typically displayed in the Order's chapel.  Banners of Knights of the [[Order of the Thistle]] are hung in the 1911 chapel of the Order in [[St Giles Cathedral|St Giles High Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Burnett|Hodgson|2001|pp=6–7}}  [[Order of the Garter#Garter Banners in St George's Chapel|Banners of Knights]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] are displayed in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]].  From Victorian times Garter banners have been approximately 5 feet by 5 feet.{{sfn|Johnston|2011}}

Banners became available to all English armigers as a result of a report by Garter to the Earl Marshal dated 29 January 1906.  The report stated that the size of banner for Esquires and Gentlemen should be considered in the future.&lt;ref name="Garter Woodcock 2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Woodcock|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until that date they were available to all noblemen and knights banneret.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berry|1830|p={{page needed|date=July 2016}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Garter Woodcock said that the banner for an Esquire or Gentleman should be the same size as a Marquess’s and those of a lower rank down to Knight, that is, 3 feet by 3 feet.&lt;ref name="Garter Woodcock 2011"/&gt;

In [[Scotland]], the size of personal banners, excluding any fringes, are specified by the [[Lord Lyon]].&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;
{|
|+ '''Scottish Banners'''
|-
|Rank || Banner Size
|-
|The Sovereign||1.50 metres square
|-
|[[Duke]]s||1.25 metres square
|-
|[[Earl]]s||1.10 metres square
|-
|[[Viscount]]s and [[Baron]]s||1.00 metres square
|-
|[[Baronet]]s and [[Prescriptive Barony|Feudal Barons]]||0.90 metres square
|-
|Other [[Armiger]]s||70 centimetres wide x 85 centimetres high&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;
|}

===Standard===
[[File:Stafford flag.png|left|thumb|300px|Standard of Sir Henry de Stafford, about 1475, features the [[Stafford knot]] and [[Bohun swan]] [[heraldic badge]]s differenced with a ''crescent gules'' for [[cadency]]. The standard bears the [[St George's Cross|Cross of Saint George]] for England.  Black and red (''sable and gules'') are Sir Henry's livery colours.{{sfn|Boutell|1914|p=251}}]]

The heraldic standard appeared about the middle of the fourteenth century, and was in general use by personages of high rank in the two following centuries.  The standard appears to have been adopted for the special purpose of displaying badges. "The badge was worn on his livery by a servant as retainer, and consequently the standard by which he mustered in camp was of the livery colours, and bore the badge, with both of which the retainer was familiar."&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

Heraldic flags that are used by individuals, like a monarch, as a means of identification are often called ''standards'' (e.g. [[royal standard]]). These flags, more usually ''banners'', however are not standards in a strict heraldic sense but have come to be known as such. A standard is not rectangular: it tapers, usually from 4 feet down to 2 feet, and the [[flag terminology|fly]] edge is rounded (lanceolate). In [[England]] any armiger who has been granted a badge is entitled to fly a standard.

The medieval English standard was larger than the other flags, and its size varied with the owner’s rank. The [[St George's Cross|Cross of St. George]] usually appeared next to the staff, and the rest of the field was generally divided ''per fess'' (horizontally) into two colours, in most cases the livery colours of the owner. "With some principal figure or device occupying a prominent position, various badges are displayed over the whole field, a [[motto]], which is placed bend-wise, having divided the standard into compartments. The edges are fringed throughout, and the extremity is sometimes swallow-tailed, and sometimes rounded."&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

[[File:Flag of Early Medieval Kingdom of Leon.svg|thumb|right|330px|Standard of the [[Kingdom of León|Leonese Monarchs]] during the Middle Ages (until the 13th century). It's one of the oldest heraldic flags; the documentation for the colours dates from c. 1150.&lt;ref name=" Chronicle"&gt;{{harvnb|Lipskey|1972|p={{page needed|date=July 2016}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Oriflamme]] was the [[royal standard]] of the [[King of France]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

In [[Scotland]], a standard requires a separate grant by the [[Lord Lyon]]. Such a grant is only made if certain conditions are met.

The length of the standard depends upon one’s [[Peerage|noble rank]].&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

|-
|The Sovereign||21 feet
|-
|[[Duke]]s||20 feet

|[[Marquis]]es||18 feet
|-

|-
|[[Viscount]]s||15 feet

|[[Lords of Parliament]]||13 feet
|-
|[[Baronets]]||12 feet
|-
|[[Knight]]s and [[Prescriptive Barony|Feudal Barons]]||10 feet&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;
|}

===Banderole===
{{main article|Banderole}}

A '''Banderole''' ([[French language|Fr.]] for a "little banner"), has both a literal descriptive meaning for its use by knights and ships, and is also heraldic device for representing bishops.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}

===Gonfalone===
[[File:Royal Banner of Denmark (14th Century).svg|thumb|160px|Royal Banner of the King of Denmark in the 14th century, based on the [[Coat of arms of Denmark|Royal Arms of Denmark]].]]
{{main article|Gonfalone}}

A gonfalone or gonfalon is a vertically hung banner emblazoned with a coat of arms.  Gonfalons have wide use in civic, religious, and academic heraldry.  The term originated in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], where communities, or neighborhoods, traditionally displayed ''gonfaloni'' in public ceremonies.

=== Guidon ===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:RGH Guidon small.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Guidon of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars]] --&gt;

The Scots guidon is similar in shape to the standard and pennon.  At 6.5' long, it is smaller than the standard and twice the size of the pennon. Guidons are assigned by the Lord Lyon to those individuals who qualify for a grant of supporters to their Arms and to other individuals who have a following such as individuals who occupy a position of leadership or a long-term official position commanding the loyalty of more than a handful of people. The Guidon tapers to a round, unsplit end at the fly.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

A guidon can also refer to a cavalry troop's banner, such as that which survived the Custer massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40608795/ns/us_news-life/#.USl8s1f_rOc|title=Custer's 'Last Flag' sells for $2.2 million|author=|date=10 December 2010|website=nbcnews.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pinsel ===
The Scottish pinsel is triangular in shape, 2.5 feet high at the hoist and 4.5 feet in width tapering to a point. This is the flag denoting a person to whom a [[Scottish clan|Clan]] Chief has delegated authority for a particular occasion, such as a [[clan gathering]] when the Chief is absent. This flag is allotted only to Chiefs or very special Chieftain-Barons for practical use, and only upon the specific authority of the Lord Lyon King of Arms.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

The '''Imperial Standards of Iran''' were the personal official flags of the [[Shāhanshāh]], [[Shahbānū]], and Crown Prince of Iran, adopted at the beginning of 1971.

The official flag of Shāhanshāh consisted of a pale-blue field with the [[flag of Iran]] in the upper left corner and the Pahlavi coat of arms in the centre. At the top of the coat of arms was the Pahlavi crown, created for the Coronation of [[Rezā Shāh of Iran|Rezā Shāh]] in 1926. The Imperial motto of Pahlavi is "''Mara dad farmud va Khod Davar Ast''" ("Justice He bids me do, as He will judge me" or, alternatively, "He gave me power to command, and He is the judge").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|title=Iranian Empire (Pahlavi dynasty): Imperial standards|accessdate=2007-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412122220/http://fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|archivedate=2007-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pale blue]] was the colour of the Imperial Family. The uniforms of the Imperial Guard included this colour to show their allegiance.

'''Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|proporzec Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej – Zwierzchnika Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}) is a [[Maritime flag#Jacks|jack flag]] used in the [[Polish Armed Forces]] to mark the presence and pay respect to the [[President of the Republic of Poland]] who is also ''ex officio'' the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Armed Forces. The jack is raised on [[Polish Navy]] ships when the president is officially on board, as well as on land, if the president is present. The design of the jack is based directly on the [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|pre-war]] [[Banner of Poland|Banner of the Republic of Poland]] which used to be part of presidential insignia.

== Legal specifications ==
[[File:Presidential jack unknown soldier.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Presidential jack flying at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] during a [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|Constitution Day]] ceremony]]

The jack of the President is defined in the Ordinance of the Minister of National Defense on the Use of Insignia of the Armed Forces of January 26, 1996 with subsequent amendments. The ordinance defines the jack of the President as "a piece of red cloth with the image of the state eagle (i.e. the White Eagle from the [[Coat of Arms of Poland|national coat of arms]]) in the middle, bordered with a ''wężyk generalski''", an ornate wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of [[generał|general's]] rank. The [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] to [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]] ratio is 5:6. The proportion of the eagle's height to the fly is 3:5.&lt;ref name=ordinance&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 29 stycznia 1996 r. w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm M.P.96.14.178] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015219/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The presidential jack is used in military ceremonies attended by the commander-in-chief. Celebrations of the Constitution Day, May 3; Polish Armed Forces Day, August 15; and Independence Day, November 11 (see [[Public holidays in Poland]]) are typical occasions. For example, during the grand military parade on August 15, 2007 in [[Warsaw]], President [[Lech Kaczyński]] rode in a convertible jeep preceded by a mounted [[Polish cavalry|cavalry]] officer carrying the presidential jack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
while a smaller jack was attached to the president's jeep as a car flag. The jack also draped the coffins of President Kaczyński (see [[Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska]]) and former President-in-exile [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]] after both died in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk air crash]] of 2010.

== History ==
[[File:Banner of Poland.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Banner of the Republic on display in the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]

{{Main article|Banner of Poland}}

A state banner was used in Poland as insignia of the head of state (king, president, etc.) as early as the 11th century CE. Although its design changed with time, it was always a heraldic banner, i.e. one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle in a red field. In 1919, the [[Sejm]] (lower house of parliament) established the [[Banner of the Republic of Poland]], reserved for use by the head of state &amp;ndash; the State Leader (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') and, later, President of the Republic. In 1927, it was modified to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms. At this point the banner was virtually identical to the current design for the presidential jack.&lt;ref name=znamier&gt;{{cite book

 | location = Warsaw
 | pages = 299
 | isbn = 83-7115-055-5|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the Banner of the Republic was still used by [[Polish government-in-exile|presidents-in-exile]] while a variant with a crownless eagle was used by Communist authorities at home. Officially abandoned in 1955, the banner continued to be used in practice by the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|prime minister]] and, during the 1960s, by the [[Polish Council of State|Council of State]], a collective head of state of the time.&lt;ref name=znamier/&gt;

The modern Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland was established by the Minister of National Defense on January 29, 1996 with the sole purpose of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board.&lt;ref name=ordinance/&gt; On December 14, 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of Polish Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 14 grudnia 2005 r. zmieniające zarządzenie w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm M.P.05.82.1165] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033325/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] on May 3, 2005.

'''Jeanne Louise Calment''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒan lwiz kalmɑ̃|lang}}; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French [[supercentenarian]] who has the [[Oldest people|longest confirmed human lifespan]] of 122 years, 164 days.

She lived in [[Arles]] all her life, outliving both her daughter and grandson. She became the oldest living person on 11 January 1988 at 112, one hundred years after encountering [[Vincent van Gogh]], who visited her father's shop. She was declared the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995 at 120.

Although Calment came from a long-living family, there is no particular explanation for her remarkable longevity. She had lived a comfortable and stress-free life, with a healthy appetite and a daily exercise routine, enabling her to walk without a stick until 114.

==Early life==
[[File:Acte de naissance de Jeanne Calment.png|thumb|rt|upright=1.14|[[Birth certificate]] of Jeanne Louise Calment]]

Calment was born in Arles, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], Southern France on 21 February 1875.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath&gt;{{cite news | first=Craig R.| last=Whitney| title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260| work=New York Times| date=5 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Nicolas Calment (8 November 1837– 28 January 1931)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09a.htm|title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity - Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|last=Wilhelm|first=Peter|website=www.demogr.mpg.de|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]], and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was from a family of [[miller]]s. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, although none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.

==Personal life==
From the age of seven until her [[first communion|first holy communion]], Jeanne Calment attended Madame Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then attended the local college, finishing at the age of 16 with the diploma ''brevet Classique'', after which she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills.&lt;ref name = YouTube1994&gt;{{YouTube|cB_yIlnaryg|Interview with Jeanne Calment, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Allard1998Englishchapter2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=27–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April 1896, at the age of 21, she married her [[Double cousin|double second cousin]], Fernand Nicolas Calment (1868–1942). Their paternal grandfathers were brothers, hence the same surname and their paternal grandmothers were also sisters.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck&gt;{{cite web | title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity – Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life| url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm| publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]]| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernand was a wealthy shop owner and she moved into the apartments above his shop ''Grands Magasins de Nouveautés'', where she lived until the age of 110.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; His wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work; instead they led a leisured lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]], and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;

In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering all the way up to the glacier. She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s, but disliked killing birds.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher= Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=4–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered the most important historical event in her lifetime to have been the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of the Russian imperial family]], a view shared by many fellow centenarians.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter12&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because "they did not take anything away". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with [[Copper(II) sulfate#As a fungicide and herbicide|copper sulfate]] the day before, developed [[jaundice]], and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on 2 October 1942 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter6/&gt;

Their only child, a daughter named Yvonne Marie Nicolle Calment (19 January 1898 – 19 January 1934), produced a grandson, Frédéric Billiot, on 23 December 1926.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Yvonne died from [[pneumonia]], after which Calment raised Frédéric herself.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | title = World's oldest person dies at 122| url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/04/obit.oldest/| publisher=CNN| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frédéric became a doctor, and lived with her until his death in an automobile accident in 1963.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged20.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Calment at age 20 in 1895]]
In 1965, at age 90 and with no heirs, Calment signed a contract to sell her apartment to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a [[life estate]].&lt;ref name=LifeLease&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/world/a-120-year-lease-on-life-outlasts-apartment-heir.html |title=A 120-Year Lease on Life Outlasts Apartment Heir |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 December 1995 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 [[French franc|francs]] (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000, more than double the apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LifeLease/&gt; Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals."&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;  During all these years, Calment used to say to them that she "competed with [[Methuselah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boutique.ina.fr/video/CAB89003100/jeanne-calment-114-and-a-rencontre-van-gogh.fr.html |title=From an interview made in 1989 |publisher=Boutique.ina.fr |date=21 January 1989 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;

==Recognition and registration as record-breaker==
[[File:JeanneCalmentaged22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Calment at age 22 in 1897]]
On 20 June 1986 Jeanne Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111 when Eugenie Roux died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Go, granny, go |url= |newspaper=The Anniston Star|location=Anniston, Alabama |date=July 2, 1986|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her international fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters. She said at the time that she had met Van Gogh 100 years before, in 1888, as a thirteen-year-old girl in her uncle's shop,&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=mccook&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VqEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7GgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026%2C3313956| title=World's oldest person dead| date=4 August 1997| work=McCook Daily Gazette| page=1| accessdate=5 May 2011| location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he bought some canvas, later describing him as "ugly" (''laid''), "blighted by [[Alcoholism#Signs and symptoms|alcohol]]" (''brûlé par l'alcool''), and visiting [[Prostitution in France|brothels]] (''il fréquentait des maisons de tolérance'').&lt;ref name=YouTube1994/&gt;

After her 1988 interview, at age 112, Calment was given the [[Guinness World Records]] title for the world's ‘Oldest person (living)’ upon the death of [[Florence Knapp (supercentenarian)|Florence Knapp]] on 11 January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1988-oldest-living-human-being-of-all-time-392901 '''1988: Oldest Living Human Being of All Time'']; Guinness World Records&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, however, the title was withdrawn and given to [[Carrie C. White]] of Florida, who claimed to have been born in 1874, although this was discounted by subsequent census research.&lt;ref name=SunJournal&gt;{{cite news | first = Ronda| last = Addy| title = Life Expectancy| url = http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| archive-url = https://archive.is/20090201092634/http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 1 February 2009| work = [[Sun Journal (Lewiston)| Sun Journal]]| date = 25 May 2008| accessdate = 6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon White's death on 14 February 1991, Calment, then a week shy of 116, became recognized as the oldest living person, though there are unverified claims that older people were alive at the time (see [[Longevity claims]] and [[Longevity myths]]).

At the age of 114, she appeared briefly in the 1990 film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'' as herself, becoming the oldest person ever to appear in a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oldest Person| url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/oldest-person/| work=[[Guinness World Records]]| accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film about her life, entitled ''Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment'', was released in 1995.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute&gt;{{cite web | title=Tribute to Jeanne Calment, memorial – Lasting tribute| url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106034901/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938 |archivedate=6 November 2009 |publisher=Lasting Tribute| accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''Time's Mistress'', a four-track CD of Calment speaking over a background of [[Rapping|rap]], was released.&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle&gt;{{cite news | title=Believed to be world's oldest, woman in France dies at 122 |url=http://supercentenarian.com/oldest/jeanne-calment.html |date=4 August 1997 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1995, Calment reached 120 years and 238 days to become the "oldest person ever" according to Guinness, surpassing [[Shigechiyo Izumi]] of Japan, whose claim (120 years 237 days old at the time of his death on 21 February 1986, which was Calment's 111th birthday) was discounted in February 2011, more than thirteen years after Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged40.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Calment at age 40 in 1915]]
Exceeding any other longevity case reported, Calment establishes the record as the most verifiable supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, beginning with the 1876 census (Calment is listed as a one-year-old), she was indexed in fourteen census documents until 1975.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

After her death, 116-year-old [[Marie-Louise Meilleur]] became the oldest recognized living person. Both before and after Calment's death, there have been several claims to have surpassed her age (see [[Unverified longevity claims]]), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.

== Health and lifestyle ==
Calment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated ''J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais'' (I have never been ill, never ever).&lt;ref name="Mise au Point"&gt;{{cite news |date = 15 June 2014 |accessdate = 2 December 2016 |title = Comme si c’était hier: Jeanne Calment |url = http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/mise-au-point/5931633-comme-si-c-etait-hier-jeanne-calment.html |work = Mise au Point |publisher = Radio Télévision Suisse Un }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about her daily routine while at [[primary school]], she replied that "when you are young you get up at eight o'clock".{{efn|The [[Time in France#History|French time zone]] has varied historically.

At age 15 her cousin and eventual husband started courting her, but she was too young to be interested in boys and preferred [[confectionery|sweets]].

She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s.&lt;ref name="Garoyan1990ThesisPart1"/&gt; Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion.

She and her husband sometimes travelled to nearby Marseilles where, at the ''Phocéen'' restaurant, they treated themselves to seafood, a glass of white wine, and bread and butter. Unlike her husband she did not enjoy pastries, but she did like creams (''crèmes''), cakes and in particular ''quatre-quarts'' ([[pound cake]]), and vanilla ice cream.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; At "retirement age" she broke her ankle and apart from that had never been ill.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishWitticisms/&gt; She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Around her hundredth year she fractured her leg but recovered quickly and was able to walk again.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; 

After the death of her grandson in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; According to one of her doctors, she had formerly been healthy but began showing signs of [[senescence]] (or [[Ageing|aging]]) at this point.&lt;ref name=France2DrLevraud&gt;{{cite news | first=| last=| title=France 2 Interview with Dr Catherine Levraud, Medical Doctor Treating Jeanne Calment| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE| work=France 2 television| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daily routine at ages 111–114===
After her admission to the care home ''Maison du Lac'' [House on the Lake] in January 1985 at the age of 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands ("a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and [[rusks]]. 

Her morning ablutions included washing herself unassisted with a flannel rather than taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a [[Dunhill (cigarette)|Dunhill cigarette]] (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank a small amount of [[Port wine]]. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange. 

In the afternoon she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10pm.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years|location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=85–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical examination at ages 111–116===
Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with arthropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150&amp;nbsp;cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher=Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=22–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage Calment was still in good shape, and continued to walk without a cane&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; until she fractured her [[femur]] during a fall at age 114 (January 1990), which required surgery.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;&lt;ref name=SunJournal/&gt; After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt; and abandoned her daily routine.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt;

At the age of 115 she attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco") and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in [137&amp;nbsp;cm] and her weight was 88 pounds [40&amp;nbsp;kg]; she confirmed that she had always been small, but she had lost weight in recent years. In terms of pigmentation, her eyes were [[eye color|light gray]] and her [[Human hair color#Gray and white|white hair]] had once been [[chestnut brown]].&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;

===Diet at 116===
With regards to her diet, the three researchers' interviews revealed that in the care home she said she always had a dessert with every meal. She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on [[chocolate]] in her old age: sometimes over a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb) of chocolate per week.&lt;ref&gt;"More than once, she surprised her entourage by her digestive abilities; she said herself 'I have the stomach of an ostrich!' which did not prevent her from appreciating good things. She showed herself more than once capable of absorbing considerable quantities of chocolate: more than a kilo per week." in Michel Allard, Victor Lèbre, Jean-Marie Robine ''Les 120 ans de Jeanne Calment. Doyenne de l'Humanité'', Le cherche midi éditeur, Paris, 1994, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological examination at 118===
At the age of 118, over a period of six months, she was submitted to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ritchie |first1=K| title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity J.

===Popular media reports===
Apocryphal media articles reported varying details. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling "coloured pencils" to Van Gogh, and seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] being built.&lt;ref name="Deseret19950221"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CL4RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1584,3192209| title=World's oldest person marks 120 beautiful, happy years |publisher=News.google.com| date=21 February 1995| accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote that she did not start fencing until age 85 (1960).&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in [[olive oil]].&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; She is also said to have credited her calmness, saying, "That's why they call me Calment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1008681/Alcohol-cigarettes-chocolates-sweets--The-secrets-long-life.html| title=Alcohol, Cigarettes, Chocolates and Sweets – The Secrets of a Long Life?| work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercentenarian clinical study===
Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine and colleagues compared Jeanne Calment with a list of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Jeanne Calment and her successors.

==Death ==
On her 122nd birthday on 21 February 1997, it was announced that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer [[Jean-Marie Robine]], a co-author of a book about Jeanne Calment, reportedly said that this "allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deller |first=Deborah |url=http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |title=Jeanne Calment : Obituary |publisher=ThisIsAnnouncements |accessdate=16 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729221706/http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost [[Visual impairment|blind]] and [[deaf]], as recently as a month before her death.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt; Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am [[Central European Time]]&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE ''France 2'']; August 4 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of Records]]'', 1999 edition, p. 102, {{ISBN|0-85112-070-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of unspecified causes.&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; According to the researchers, the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the ''rue Gambetta'', and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter14&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

==In medieval Welsh literature==
[[File:Uther Pendragon by W. H. Margetson.png|thumb|upright|''Uther Pendragon'' by [[William Henry Margetson|W. H. Margetson]] (1914)]]

In Welsh Arthurian literature from before the time of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), Arthur was granted numerous relations and family members. Several early Welsh sources are usually taken as indicative of [[Uther Pendragon]] being known as Arthur's father before Geoffrey wrote, with Arthur also being granted a brother ([[Madoc ap Uthyr|Madog]]) and a nephew ([[Eliwlod]]) in these texts.&lt;ref&gt;T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.145–51; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at pp.53-4&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur also appears to have been assigned a sister in this material – [[Gawain|Gwalchmei]] is named as his sister-son (nephew) in ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', his mother being one Gwyar.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.372–3&lt;/ref&gt; ''Culhwch and Olwen'', the ''Vita Iltuti'' and the ''[[Brut Dingestow]]'' combine to suggest that Arthur had a mother too, named [[Igraine|Eigyr]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this immediate family, Arthur was said to have had a great variety of more distant relatives, including maternal aunts, uncles, cousins and a grandfather named [[Amlawdd Wledig|Anlawd (or Amlawdd) Wledig]] ("Prince Anlawd"). The latter is the common link between many of these figures and Arthur: thus the relationship of first cousins that is implied or stated between Arthur, [[Culhwch]], [[Illtud]], and Goreu mab Custenhin depends upon all of their mothers being daughters of this Anlawd, who appears to be ultimately a genealogical construct designed to allow such inter-relationships between characters to be postulated by medieval Welsh authors.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.44-5&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur's maternal uncles in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', including Llygatrud Emys, Gwrbothu Hen, Gweir Gwrhyt Ennwir and Gweir Baladir Hir, similarly appear to derive from this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;These maternal uncles are named at lines 251-2, 288-90: R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The genealogies from the 13th-century Mostyn MS. 117 assert that Arthur is the son of [[Uther Pendragon|Uthyr]], the son of Custennin, the son of Cynfawr, the son of Tudwal, the son of Morfawr, the son of Eudaf, the son of Cadwr the son of Cynan, the son of [[Caradog ap Bran|Caradoc]], the son of [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]], the son of [[Llŷr]].

Regarding Arthur's own family, his wife is consistently stated to be [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]], usually the daughter of King [[Leodegrance|Ogrfan Gawr]] (variation: 'Gogrfan Gawr', "[G]Ogrfan the Giant") and sister to [[Gwenhwyach]], although ''Culhwch'' and ''Bonedd yr Arwyr'' do indicate that Arthur also had some sort of relationship with Eleirch daughter of Iaen, which produced a son named Kyduan (Cydfan).&lt;ref&gt;See T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.151–5; R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.76–7, 107-08 -- the latter note that the sons of Iaen appear to have been kinsmen of Arthur on ''their'' father's side, not Arthur's father's side, i.e. they were Arthur's in-laws via their sister&lt;/ref&gt; Kyduan was not the only child of Arthur according to Welsh Arthurian tradition – he is also ascribed sons called Amr (Anir),&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]] and also the romance ''[[Geraint and Enid]]'', which mentions an "Amhar son of Arthur"&lt;/ref&gt; Gwydre,&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116-7&lt;/ref&gt; Llacheu&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), pp.416–8&lt;/ref&gt; and Duran.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rowland, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion'' (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250–1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other medieval literature==
[[File:Guinever by W. H. Margetson.png|left|thumb|upright|''Guinevere'' by W. H. Margetson (1914)]]

Relatively few members of Arthur's family in the Welsh materials are carried over to the works of Geoffrey and the [[Chivalric romance|chivalric romancers]]. His grandfather Anlawd Wledic and his maternal uncles, aunts and cousins do not appear there, and neither do any of his sons or his paternal relatives. Only the core family seem to have made the journey: his wife Gwenhwyfar (who became [[Guinevere]]), his father [[Uther]], his mother ([[Igerna]]) and his sister-son Gwalchmei ([[Gawain]]). Gwalchmei's mother – Arthur's sister – failed to make the journey, Gwyar's place being taken by Anna, the wife of [[King Lot|Loth]], in Geoffrey's account, whilst Medraut ([[Mordred]]) is made into a second sister-son for Arthur (a status he does not have in the Welsh material).&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Roberts, "Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' and ''Brut Y Brenhinedd''" in R. Bromwich, A. O. H. Jarman and B. F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.98–116 at pp.112–3&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, new family members enter the Arthurian tradition from this point onwards. Uther is given a new family, including two brothers and a father,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|Book 8.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; while Arthur gains a sister, [[Morgan le Fay]] (first named as Arthur's sister by [[Chrétien de Troyes]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Arthurian Romances'' trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; and a new son, Loholt, in Chrétien's ''Eric and Enide'', the ''[[Perlesvaus]]'' and the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthurian Romances'' trans. W. Kibler and C. W. Carroll (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1991); ''The High Book of the Grail: A translation of the thirteenth century romance of Perlesvaus'' trans. N. Bryant (Brewer, 1996); ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'' trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another significant new family-member is Arthur's half-sister [[Morgause]], the daughter of Gorlois and Igerna and mother of Gawain and Mordred in the French romances (replacing Geoffrey of Monmouth's Anna in this role). In the Vulgate ''Mort Artu'' we find [[Mordred]]'s relationship with Arthur once more reinterpreted, as he is made the issue of an unwitting incestuous liaison between Arthur and this Morgause, with Arthur dreaming that Mordred would grow up to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation'' trans. N. J. Lacy (New York: Garland, 1992-6), 5 vols.&lt;/ref&gt; This tale is preserved in all the romances based on the ''Mort Artu'', and by the time of Malory's ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' Arthur has started to plot, [[Herod the Great|Herod]]-like, to kill all children born on the same day as Mordred in order to save himself from this fate.&lt;ref&gt;See A. Varin, "Mordred, King Arthur's Son" in ''Folklore'' 90 (1979), pp.167–77 on Mordred's birth, its origins and Arthur's reaction to his dream.&lt;/ref&gt; A third half-sister, [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine of Garlot|Elaine]], is also added at this time. Through his sisters, Arthur is given further nephews ([[Gareth]], [[Gaheris]], [[Agravain]], [[Ywain]], and [[Galeschin]]) who become Knights of the [[Round Table]]. {{clear left}}

==Descendants==
Although Arthur is given sons in both early and late Arthurian tales, he is rarely granted significant further generations of descendants; this is at least partly because of the premature deaths of his sons in these legends. Amr is the first to be mentioned in Arthurian literature, appearing in the 9th-century ''[[History of the Britons|Historia Brittonum]]'':

:"There is another wonder in the region which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; and the name of the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it sometimes six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length – and I myself have put this to the test."&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Brittonum'', [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|73]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Why Arthur chose to kill his son is never made clear. The only other reference to Amr comes in the post-Galfridian Welsh romance ''[[Geraint and Enid|Geraint]]'', where "Amhar son of Arthur" is one of Arthur’s four chamberlains along with [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]]'s son Amhren.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), p.231&lt;/ref&gt; Gwydre is similarly unlucky, being slaughtered by the giant boar [[Twrch Trwyth]] in ''Culhwch and Olwen'', along with two of Arthur's maternal uncles – no other references to either Gwydre or Arthur's uncles survive.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), lines 1116–7 and note on Gwydre; T. Jones and G. Jones, ''The Mabinogion'' (London: Dent, 1949), pp.132, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

More is known of Arthur's son Llacheu. He is one of the "Three Well-Endowed Men of the Island of Britain", according to the [[Welsh Triads|Triad]] 4, and he fights alongside [[Sir Kay|Cei]] in the early Arthurian poem ''[[Pa gur|Pa gur yv y porthaur?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: the Welsh Triads'' (Cardiff: University of Wales, 1978), no. 4; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father is in ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', Llacheu appears in the 12th-century and later Welsh poetry as a standard of heroic comparison and he also seems to have been similarly a figure of local topographic folklore too.&lt;ref&gt;[[O. J. Padel]], ''Arthur in Medieval Welsh Literature'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), pp.55–6, 99; P. Sims-Williams, "The Early Welsh Arthurian Poems" in R. Bromwich, A.O.H. Jarman and B.F. Roberts (edd.) ''The Arthur of the Welsh'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1991), pp.33–71 at p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, it is generally agreed that all these references indicate that Llacheu was a figure of considerable importance in the early Arthurian cycle.&lt;ref&gt;T. Green, ''Concepts of Arthur'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2007), pp.168-9&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Llacheu too dies, with the speaker in the pre-Galfridian poem ''Ymddiddan Gwayddno Garanhir ac Gwyn fab Nudd'' remembering that he had "been where Llacheu was slain / the son of Arthur, awful in songs / when ravens croaked over blood."&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Coe and S. Young, ''The Celtic Sources for the Arthurian Legend'' (Llanerch, 1995), p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Loholt is treacherously killed by [[Sir Kay]] so that the latter can take credit for the defeat of the giant Logrin in the ''[[Perlesvaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The High Book of the Grail: A translation of the 13th-century romance of Perlesvaus'' trans. N. Bryant (Brewer, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Another son, known only from a possibly 15th-century Welsh text, is said to have died on the field of [[Battle of Camlann|Camlann]]:

:Sandde Bryd Angel drive the crow
:off the face of ?Duran [son of Arthur].
:Dearly and belovedly his mother raised him.
::Arthur sang it&lt;ref&gt;J. Rowland, ''Early Welsh Saga Poetry: a Study and Edition of the Englynion'' (Cambridge, 1990), pp.250-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Medraut/Mordred is an exception to this tradition of a childless death for Arthur's sons. Mordred, like Amr, is killed by Arthur – at Camlann – according to Geoffrey of Monmouth and the post-Galfridian tradition but, unlike the others, he is ascribed [[Sons of Mordred|two]] sons, both of whom rose against Arthur's successor and cousin [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]] with the help of the Saxons. However, in Geoffrey's ''Historia'' (when Arthur's killing of Mordred and Mordred's sons first appear), Mordred was not yet actually Arthur's son.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' [[s:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 11#2|Book 11.2-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later literature has expanded Arthur's family further. [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s 16th-century romance ''[[Tom a Lincoln]]'' adds another illegitimate son, the eponymous Tom. Through Tom, Arthur is also given grandsons referred to only as the [[Black Knight (Arthurian legend)|Black Knight]] and [[Faerie Knight]]. Other works, such as [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'', [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Bridal of Triermain]]'' and modern film and television adaptations of Arthurian legend, have occasionally given Arthur daughters, diverging from the earlier legends.

On 21 November 2013 [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from the [[National Crime Agency#Organisational Structure|Human Trafficking Unit]] arrested two suspects at a residential address in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. A 73-year-old ethnic Indian [[Singaporean]] man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old [[Tanzanian]]&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for [[slavery]] and [[domestic servitude]].&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"/&gt; The case centred around the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]] commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers.  On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]] woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab),&lt;ref name="Sawer"/&gt; a 57-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old [[United Kingdom|British]] woman (Katy Morgan-Davies).&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women victims 'held for 30 years' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/women-victims-held-for-30-years-8954976.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.

'''Aravindan Balakrishnan''' (known to his followers as "'''Comrade Bala'''") was born in [[Kerala]], [[India]] but migrated to  [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], where his father was a soldier, when he was 10.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Aravindan Balakrishnan: the Maoist cult leader who used brutal violence and rape to strip women of their dignity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12031312/Aravindan-Balakrishnan-the-Maoist-cult-leader-who-used-brutal-violence-and-rape-to-strip-women-of-their-dignity.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balakrishnan was a student at [[Raffles Institution]] and later the [[University of Singapore]], where although gaining a reputation as a "quiet chap",&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Reuters|title=UK Maoist cult leader raped followers, enslaved daughter|url=http://www.asiaone.com/world/uk-maoist-cult-leader-raped-followers-enslaved-daughter|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=AsiaOne|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a [[communist]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]], which the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] accused of engaging in "activities which are prejudicial to the security" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical "closely associated with [[Eurocommunists]]".&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO" /&gt; The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a [[fascist state]] due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a [[British Council]] scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and married his wife Chandra in 1971.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various [[sit-in]]s and protests. He was a regular attendee at [[London]] demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] and addressed the crowds.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

In 1974, Balakrishnan and his "small clique" were expelled from the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist)]] on account of "their pursuance of conspiratorial and [[wikt:splittist|splittist]] activities ... spreading [[social fascist]] slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement" and attempting "to put themselves above the discipline of the Party".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm "Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)"], ''The Marxist-Leninist'', 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org. Quoted in Nick Cohen [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/nick-cohen/2013/11/cultists-communists-too-close-to-us-for-comfort/ "Cultists &amp; communists – too close to us for comfort"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The CPE(M–L) "repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted" by Balakrishnan in "opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"/&gt; In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the ''South London Workers' Bulletin'', which accused the CPE(M–L) of being "fascists" and "agents of imperialism".&lt;ref name="Ford-WW-989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Eddie|title=Maoist 'slaves': Combating the fascist state in Brixton  - Weekly Worker|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/989/maoist-slaves-combating-the-fascist-state-in-brixt/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Weekly Worker|issue=989|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to "build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities",&lt;ref name="On Building a"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought|title=On Building a Revolutionary Stable Base Area|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/stable-base.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[South London]], and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining [[trade unions]], describing them as agents of the "imperialist fascist bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=Inside the paranoid Maoist cults of 1970s Britain|url=http://theconversation.com/inside-the-paranoid-maoist-cults-of-1970s-britain-20739|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Conversation|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title [[Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Following [[Mao Zedong#Death and aftermath|Mao's death in 1976]], the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, [[Brixton]], which also functioned as a communist collective of "thirteen comrades", with "13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)".&lt;ref name="On Building a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970’s|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was "notorious for violence" and "anything could happen".&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Maoist 'cult' leader denies rape as he claims female commune members competed for his affections|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12019410/Maoist-cult-leader-denies-rape-as-he-claims-female-commune-members-competed-for-his-affections.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Telegraph|date=26 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed  involved "over 200 police", including officers from the [[Special Patrol Group]], "under the pretext of searching for drugs", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised,&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented "JACKIE" (an acronym for [[Jehovah]], [[Allah]], [[Christ]], [[Krishna]] and [[Eknath Easwaran|Immortal Easwaran]]) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|title=My 30 years as prisoner of a London cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/katy-morgan-davies-interview-balakrishnan-cult-brixton-survivor|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was "the elixir of life", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of "jealousy" for his lover.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2" /&gt;

She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sian Davies]] - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan.  On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later.  After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the time of Davie's death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother.

*[[Aishah Wahab]] - a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Oh Kar Eng]] - nurse from [[Malaysia]] who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day.{{r|bbc}} The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Josephine Herivel]] - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] before she joined the group.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Her father, [[John Herivel]] was one of the [[Bletchley Park]] [[codebreakers]] who helped Britain and its allies win [[World War II]]. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state.{{r|bbc}}

On 11 December 2014, it emerged that Balakrishnan had been charged with offences relating to cruelty to a person under 16, four counts of rape and 17 counts of indecent assault.

[[Image:FML names-2.png|thumb|300px|First/given, middle, and last/family/surname diagram with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]
In several cultures, a '''middle name''' is a portion of a [[personal name]] that is written between the person's [[given name]] and their [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/middle%20name |title=Middle name - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may be given a middle name regardless of whether it's necessary to distinguish them from other people with the same given name and surname. In cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, additional names are likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/381383/middle-name |title=middle name (language) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus called middle names. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names occupying that position even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a "middle name", and is actually (to mention several types of common cases): 
* part of a two-word given name (e.g. ''[[Mary Anne]]'', about [[Mary Anne Clarke]], and "[[Joe Bob Briggs]]"), 
* a [[maiden name]] (e.g. [[Hillary Clinton|Rodham]]), 
* a [[patronymic]] (e.g. [[Nikita Khrushchev|Sergeyevich]]), 
* a [[baptismal name]] (e.g. "Christopher" invoking [[Saint Christopher]]), or
* a maternal [[surname]] (such as in Portuguese and Brazilian names).
 
In the [[United States]], such names are specifically referred to as middle names; in most other countries, as far as they are given names and not, for example, [[patronymic]]s, they would simply be regarded as second, third etc. given names. In the U.S., the "middle name" is often [[abbreviated]] to the '''middle initial''' (e.g. Mary Lee Bianchi becomes Mary L. Bianchi, which is usually standard for [[signature]]s{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}) or omitted entirely in everyday use (e.g. just Mary Bianchi). An individual may have more than one middle name, or none. In the United Kingdom, for comparison, she would usually be referred to as either Mary Bianchi, M. L. Bianchi or Mary Lee Bianchi, or she may choose Lee Bianchi, and informally there may be familiar shortenings.

It is debatable how long multiple given names have existed in English-speaking countries, but it is certain that among royalty and aristocracy the practice existed by the late 17th century (and possibly earlier), as exemplified in the name of the Stuart pretender [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (1688–1766).

Despite their relatively long existence in North America, the phrase "middle name" was not recorded until 1835, in the periodical ''[[Harvardiana]]''.

The use of multiple middle names has been somewhat impeded recently{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} by the increased use of [[software|computer]] [[database]]s that occasionally allow for only a single middle name or more commonly a middle initial in storing personal records, effectively preventing people with multiple middle names from being listed in such [[databases]] under their full name. This is worsened by longer compound names, like [[María del Pilar Pereyra]] or [[María de las Nieves García]].

The abbreviation "N.M.N." (no middle name) or "N.M.I." (no middle initial), with or without periods, is sometimes used in formal documents in the United States, where a middle initial or name is expected but the person does not have one. The middle name can also be a maiden name.

Since 1905, "middle name" has also developed a figurative usage meaning a notable or outstanding attribute of a person, as in the phrase "discretion is my middle name."

==English==
In countries that primarily speak English—such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom]]—the forename of a relative is sometimes used as one's middle name to honor familial heritage.&lt;ref name=genfiles&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genfiles.com/articles/middle-names/ | title=The Use of Middle Names| date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases in the United States, however, a person's middle name has little or no lineage-related context, and is used instead to honor close family friends or notable public figures.&lt;ref name=genfiles/&gt;

In the United States, those who choose to be known primarily by their middle name may abbreviate their first name as an [[initial]], e.g. [[J. Edgar Hoover]] (John Edgar Hoover). Others simply omit the first name, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] (Thomas Woodrow Wilson). A rare case of an individual being given only an initial as a middle name, with the initial not explicitly standing for anything, was [[Harry S. Truman]]. (He once told reporters—apparently at odds with his own practice—that the S should thus not be followed by period.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/speriod.htm | title=Truman: The "S" Period}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two given names are fairly common. In England they are traditionally more common among the "upper classes" and "middle classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nameberry.com/blog/british-baby-names-two-middle-names | title=British Baby Names: Two middle names| date=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], [[George H. W. Bush]].

Middle names can also be used as first names. Major examples are [[Paul McCartney]], [[Mitt Romney]], [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Elle Fanning]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Riley Keough]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Hayley Orrantia]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Meghan Markle]], [[Rihanna]], [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]], [[Nomar Garciaparra]], [[Bill Mumy]], [[Roger Waters]] and [[Jim Acosta]].

=== Chinese ===
{{Further|Chinese name|Generation name|Courtesy name|Art name}}
Traditionally, Chinese names consisted of three characters—the surname, followed by a two-character given name (''ming''), which is not separated into a first and middle name in usage.  Two-character given names follow a naming tradition in which the first character of the given name (and thus the second character in the three-character full name) indicates the person's generation in his/her family.  For example, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] has the given name ''Yinzhen'' (胤禛) while his brothers' names all begin with the character "Yin" (胤).  His sons' and nephews' given names all begin with the character ''Hong'' (弘). Traditionally, the list of generational names may be decided many generations in advance by the ancestors.  In such naming systems, the de facto given name is the last character of a person's full name. Even if that was the case most of the time, sometimes the person's given name is the middle character and not the last. A three-character name is both patriarchal and hierarchical, as it would inform of a person's belonging and rank within a family. During the [[One-child_policy|One-child Policy]], there was no need for a generation name as there was only one child in each generation. Many names in Mainland China were shortened to two-characters during this time, and there are many adults with shorter names remnant from this era. This would not be found in Taiwan or Hong Kong.

A fading Chinese tradition is to use a [[courtesy name]], called ''zì'' (字) in place of a male's given name in adulthood.  Traditionally ''zì'' is given by one's father upon reaching the age of maturity at 20 years old.  This name is intended for use in formal situations and formal writing and confers a status of adulthood and respect.  Like the ''ming'', the ''zì'' is composed of two characters which usually reflect the meaning of the ''ming''.  Prior to the 20th century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their ''zì''.  An alternative courtesy name is the ''hào'' ({{zh|s=号|t=號|p=hào|labels=no}}; Japanese gō; Korean: ho; Vietnamese: hiệu), which usually referred to as the pseudonym. A ''hào'' was usually self-chosen and it was possible to have more than one. It had no connection with the bearer's ''míng'' or ''zì''; rather it was often a personal choice and may have reflected a personal belief or philosophy. Chinese adults may more frequently use the ''hào'' to refer to themselves. The ''zì'' or ''hào'' can be used independently of the given name and of each other, but the given name is almost always used with the family name in official situations.

Some [[Chinese American]]s move their Chinese given name ([[Romanization of Chinese|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]]) to the middle name position and use an English first name, e.g. [[James Soong|James Chu-yu Soong]], [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang]], and [[Michelle Kwan|Michelle Wingshan Kwan]]. The Chinese given name usually has two characters which are usually combined into a single middle name for better organizational purposes, especially with [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] names, such as [[Bruce Lee]]'s middle name, Junfan. There are also some new immigrants whose Chinese given names are their first names followed by English middle names.

The practice of taking English and Chinese given names is also common in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. However, rather than placing the Chinese given name between the English given name and the family name, it is commonly placed after the family name in these places. Under such a system, Bruce Junfan Lee would have been Bruce Lee Junfan. This practice is consistent with both the Western convention of putting the given name before the family name and the Chinese convention of putting the given name after the family name.

==Scandinavia==
In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the term middle name refers to names that are originally surnames, but not part of the last name of the name bearer. The term middle name does not refer to additional given names, which are instead referred to as given names. A middle name could be e.g. one's mother's maiden name or the last name of another recent ancestor (for instance a grandparent). One can have several middle names, but it is unusual to have more than one or two. In law, middle names have a separate status. In practice, their status is similar to that of additional given names, and middle names are often omitted in everyday use, just like a person with 3 or 4 given names would only use one of them in most situations. The historical purpose of middle names is to honour some related family or person, a godparent, or even a completely unrelated person, such as a locally or nationally prominent figure. Until the 19th century, it was not unusual to have the last name of a godparent as one's middle name, even when the godparent was not a blood relative. This practice, and the use of middle names in general, however, was mostly limited to the bourgeois class and the nobility, and was seldom seen among common people. In the 20th century, the use of middle names, especially one's mother's maiden name, was more widely adopted, although it is by no means mandatory. There are few set rules for how names are constructed today; people are required to have one given name and one family name, but can have as many additional given names and middle names as they like.

In the example [[Carl Viggo Manthey Lange]], the names Carl and Viggo are given names, while Manthey is a middle name and Lange is the family name. Manthey is his mother's maiden name. Unless his full name is used, he is correctly referred to as Mr. Lange, not as Mr. Manthey Lange. Carl Viggo Manthey Lange has a name typical of the Norwegian bourgeois class, with both his family name and his middle name being of foreign origin and being recognised surnames. Most Norwegians and Danes of the working class and peasant class used [[patronymic]]s until the 19th century, when permanent family names became mandatory, first in Denmark in the early 19th century and then in Norway around 1900. A middle name is usually a recognised surname and not a patronymic. One reason middle names have become popular in the 20th century, particularly in Denmark, is that most Danish surnames originated as patronymics and are shared by a large number of people. The use of middle names in modern times serves to differentiate them from other people. For example, Danish politician [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] has some of the most common given and last names in Denmark (Lars and Rasmussen); his mother's maiden name is the slightly more unusual name Løkke, derived from a small agricultural property, so he uses it as a middle name, which differentiates him from other people named Lars Rasmussen.

In [[Sweden]], the position is much the same as in Denmark. Middle names were inaugurated in the previous Name Act of 1963, then called "tilläggsnamn" (additional name), and are called "mellannamn" (middle name) as of the present Name Act of 1983. However, it had previously been more common to join e.g. the last names of both of a child's parents, or for a married woman to join her maiden name and the husband's last name, as a double name with a hyphen; and large portions of the Swedish population have not adapted to the official system to this day, i.e. for almost 50 years. People often use a hyphen between their middle name and last name themselves, and/or are spelled that way by other people and by mass media.

Furthermore, when the term middle name was introduced in Swedish ("mellannamn") the word was assumed by many to mean the additional given names (apart from the "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'')), so since 1983 the word is being used more and more in this, officially, erratic meaning.

Occasionally, Scandinavians choose to use their middle name as their surname in everyday life. So [[Gottfrid Svartholm|Per Gottfrid Svartholm Warg]] has Per and Gottfrid as his given names, where Gottfrid, not Per, is his name of address, Svartholm as his middle name and Warg as his last name, but in practice he uses Svartholm as a surname. This usage, however, is unofficial. Historically, a middle name could become part of a double-barreled surname (family name) and hence cease to be a middle name, especially if used for several generations. There are many family names of this kind, which contributes to the confusion about middle names that shall not be hyphenated. Some of these double-barreled surnames are combined with a hyphen, while others are not, so a double surname without a hyphen can sometimes be indistinguishable from a middle name followed by a family name.

In Scandinavia, there is no limit on how many given names one can have. Given names have never been referred to as middle names, apart from many in Sweden believing so, as mentioned above. The use of more than two or three given names is generally associated with the upper class. The first given name is not necessarily the name of address. For the sake of completeness, Swedish forms often ask people to fill in all their given names and to indicate which one is their "name of address" (''tilltalsnamn'').

==Southeast Asia==

===Vietnam===

{{Further|Vietnamese name}}

Traditional middle names in Vietnamese are "Văn" for male names and "Thị" for female names. However, modern Vietnamese do not consider these to be attractive names, especially "Thị". Therefore, nowadays popular middle names also are popular first names. Middle names play an important role in Vietnamese full names; they could help creating beautiful names when combine with first names, distinguishing people who have the same first name (there are many common last names in Vietnam), and also distinguishing the gender of the names ([[unisex name]]s are used widely in Vietnam). Hence, Vietnamese rarely abbreviate their middle names.

===Philippines===
{{further information|Filipino name}}

For Filipinos, the middle name is usually the maternal surname, which is the maiden surname of a person's mother. The use of the maternal surname as middle name is from American influence, where Filipinos adopted English naming customs, when they once used [[Spanish naming customs]], that used two surnames (paternal and maternal) joined with the particle ''y'' (or ''e'', before "i"), which remains in use but became restricted to  very formal purposes, police records and legal proceedings. In the Spanish naming system, the middle name corresponds to the maternal surname. The middle name (or the maternal surname) is usually being abbreviated to a middle initial. Thus, a person with the full name ''Juan Santos Macaraig'', with ''Santos'' the middle name in the present order, may become ''Juan S. Macaraig'' with the middle name abbreviated, and ''Juan Macaraig y Santos'' in the Spanish system, such as those used in names on police records, especially those seen on name placards held by a convicted person on official [[mug shot]]s. The Philippine system, using "given name-middle name-surname" order (or "Christian name-mother's surname-father's surname") coincidentally follows the [[Portuguese name|Portuguese]] naming system that uses two surnames, the first being maternal and the second being paternal.

But, the maternal surname may not be the middle name at some cases. It may be a second given name, like what the term really means, as in ''[[Jose P.  Laurel]]'', where "P." (a middle initial)  corresponds to ''Paciano''.

In illegitimate children, the middle name is the maiden surname of the mother, and the middle name (maternal surname) of the mother as surname, but the surname become of the father's upon legal and administrative acknowledgement by his/her father. Children of a single father takes no middle name, even when the mother's identity is known. 

To illustrate that, the daughter of an unmarried couple named ''Ana Cristina dela Cruz Manansala'' and ''Jose Maria Panganiban Lozada'', named '"Maria Cristina'", will be named ''Maria Cristina Manansala dela Cruz'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. dela Cruz''), with Ana Cristina's middle name,  ''dela Cruz'', as surname. But once Jose Maria wants to acknowledge her as his child legally and administratively, Maria Cristina will take the surname ''Lozada'', but keep the maternal surmame ''Manansala'' as middle name, thus, ''Maria Cristina Manansala Lozada'' (or ''Ma. Cristina M. Lozada''). As the daughter of only Jose Maria, Maria Cristina will be rather called ''Maria Cristina Lozada'' or ''Ma. Cristina Lozada'', even when the mother is known.

In married women, the middle name usually corresponds to the maiden surname, but on professional society, women usually add the husband's surname after their maiden name, keeping the maternal surname. A married woman may decline taking the husband's surname and keep her maiden name as no Philippine law compels women to take her husband's surname. Thus, a woman named ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P. Limchauco''), once marrying ''Juan Pablo Sanchez Marasigan'' (or ''Juan Pablo S. Marasigan'') may take the name ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco-Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion P.  Limchauco-Marasigan''), maintaining the maternal surname ''Perez'', ''Maria Concepcion Limchauco Marasigan'' (or ''Ma. Concepcion L. Marasigan''), taking the maiden surname ''Limchauco'' as middle name and ''Marasigan'' as married surname, or keep her maiden names, remaining ''Maria Concepcion Perez Limchauco'' upon marriage.

== Latin America ==
In Argentina, most people have a middle name. According to a study, approximately 9 out of 10 Argentines born in 2010 had a middle name given to them. It used to be even more common in the past, as it is an old tradition. It's very common to use the name of a grandparent as middle name. It is termed "segundo nombre" (lit. second name). However, its widespread use is slowly shrinking due to the influence of neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/segundo-nombre-pasa-moda-usa-poner-solo_0_ryME5BGvb.html | title=El segundo nombre pasa de moda: Se usa poner sólo uno}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Actually, most of south-american, especially Hispanic citizens are acquainted with the use of compound given names, such as Maria + (second given name) or Juan + (given name), among others. This is often considered a useful way of distinguishing from similar or identical names considering that Spanish-derived surnames are strikingly common in some cultural regions (e.g. Luis Fernandez can be better distinguished if arranged as Luis Antonio Fernandez, José Luis Fernandez, Luis Eduardo Fernandez, etc.).

'''Natascha Maria Kampusch''' (born 17 February 1988) is an Austrian woman who was [[Child abduction|abducted]] at the age of 10 on 2 March 1998 and held in a secret [[Basement|cellar]] by her [[Kidnapping|kidnapper]] [[Wolfgang Přiklopil]] for more than eight years, until she escaped on 23 August 2006. She has written a book about her ordeal, ''3,096 Days'' (2010), upon which the 2013 German film ''[[3096]]'' is based.

== Early years and family ==
Kampusch was raised by her mother, Brigitta Sirny (née Kampusch), and her father, Ludwig Koch, in [[Vienna]], Austria. Her early life with her mother was reportedly not a happy one, according to Ludwig Adamovich, head of a special commission looking into possible police failures in the investigation of the kidnapping. He claimed that "the time Kampusch was imprisoned might have been better for her than what she experienced before", a statement absolutely denied by Brigitta Sirny, who threatened to sue the commission chief over his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2009-08-05/15306/Kampusch_mum_may_sue_commission_chief |title=Kampusch mum may sue commission chief – General News – Austrian Times Online News – English Newspaper |publisher=Austriantimes.at |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her family included two adult sisters, and five nieces and nephews. Sirny and Koch separated while Kampusch was still a child and divorced after her abduction. Kampusch spent time with both of them, and had returned to her mother's home from a holiday with Koch the day before her kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Kidnapping ==
The 10-year-old Kampusch left her family's residence in [[Vienna]]'s [[Donaustadt]] district on the morning of 2 March 1998, but failed to arrive at school or come home. A 12-year-old witness reported having seen her being dragged into a white minibus by two men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Captivity ===
During the eight years of her captivity, Kampusch was held in a small cellar underneath Přiklopil's garage. The entrance was concealed behind a cupboard. The cellar only had {{convert|5|sqm}} of space. It had a door made of concrete and was reinforced with steel. The room had no windows and was soundproof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5285048.stm | title = Inside the Austrian girl's 'dungeon' | publisher = BBC Online | date=25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first six months of her captivity, Kampusch was not allowed to leave the chamber at any time, and for several years of her captivity she was not allowed to leave the tiny space at night. Afterwards, she spent increasing amounts of time upstairs in the rest of the house, but each night was sent back to the chamber to sleep, as well as while Přiklopil was at work.

In later years, she was seen outside in the garden alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=William J. |last= Kole |url=http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyNiZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NTMxNDk1MiZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514045312/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyNiZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NTMxNDk1MiZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY= |archivedate=14 May 2007 |title=Neighbors say they saw captive girl alone outside|publisher=NorthJersey.com|date=30 August 2006|accessdate=4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Přiklopil's business partner has said that Kampusch seemed relaxed and happy when she and Přiklopil called at his home to borrow a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last = Leidig |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2335782,00.html |title=Kidnapper's friend says he met 'cheerful' Natascha |publisher=The Times |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=2 September 2006 | location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227130950/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article623344.ece |archive-date=27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/wien/stories/133065|title=Die Erklärung von Ernst H. im Wortlaut (The explanation by Ernst Holzapfel in his wording)|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)]] (online)|date=30 August 2006 |accessdate=1 October 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--important--&gt; After her eighteenth birthday, she was allowed to leave the house with Přiklopil, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last= Leidig |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2337830,00.html|title=Natascha tells of abductor's violence and terrifying lies|publisher=The Times|date=1 September 2006|accessdate=2 September 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours.

According to Kampusch's official statement after her escape, she and Přiklopil would get up early each morning to have breakfast together. Přiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself.&lt;!-- important: http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/:Fall-Kampusch-Verlies-Schule/569880.html --&gt; Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon on television and in the media. Thus you know how small it was.

=== Escape ===
The 18-year-old Kampusch reappeared on 23 August 2006. At 12:53&amp;nbsp;pm, when Kampusch was cleaning and vacuuming her kidnapper's [[BMW 850]]i automobile in the garden, Přiklopil got a call on his mobile phone.  Because of the vacuuming noise, he walked away to take the call. Kampusch left the vacuum cleaner running and ran away, unseen by Přiklopil, who, according to the caller, completed the phone call without any sign of being disturbed or distracted. Kampusch ran for some 200&amp;nbsp;metres through gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on the window of a 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, "I am Natascha Kampusch".&lt;ref name="elkins"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbour called the police, who arrived at 1:04&amp;nbsp;pm. Later, Kampusch was taken to the police station in the town of [[Deutsch-Wagram]].

Kampusch was identified by a [[scar]] on her body, by her passport (which was found in the room where she had been held), and by DNA tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Kampusch grew only {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} during her captivity.

Sabine Freudenberger, the first police officer to speak to Kampusch after her ordeal, said that she was astonished by her "intelligence, her [[vocabulary]]". After two years, Přiklopil had brought her books, newspapers and a radio, which she kept tuned mainly to [[Ö1 International|Ö1]], an [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] station that is known for promoting education and classical music. She also states that she constantly had a feeling that she lacked something: "a deficit. So I wanted to make that better and I tried to educate myself, to teach myself skills. I have learned to knit for example."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2345787,00.html Transcript: Natascha Kampusch TV interview]: '''Times Online'''. 6 September 2006.

Přiklopil, knowing that the police were after him, killed himself by jumping in front of a [[Vienna S-Bahn|suburban train]] near the [[Wien Nord]] station in [[Vienna]].

'''Wolfgang Přiklopil''' (14 May 1962 – 23 August 2006) was an [[Austria]]n communications technician of [[Czech people|Czech]] origin. Přiklopil was born to Karl and Waltraud Přiklopil, in [[Vienna]], and was an only child. His father, Karl, was a cognac salesman and his mother, Waltraud, a shoe saleswoman.&lt;ref name="GUARD1206"&gt;{{cite news|title=The silence of the lamb|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-2483706_2,00.html|accessdate=10 December 2006| location=London|author=Patrick Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Přiklopil worked for a time at [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] as a communications technician.

Evidence recovery was complicated by the fact that Přiklopil's only computer was a 1980s Commodore 64, which is incompatible with modern-day data recovery programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/austria/article/0,,1865500,00.html|title=Kidnapper's retro computer offers scant clues|author=Mark Oliver|date=5 September 2006|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried under the name "Karl Wendelberger" on 8 September 2006 in the Piplitz family grave plot{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} in the town of [[Laxenburg]], south of Vienna.

Přiklopil allegedly had a daughter with the sister of a business partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2303168/Natascha-Kampuschs-father-names-second-kidnapper-claims-police-covered-errors-search-daughter-explosive-new-book.html|title=Natascha Kampusch's father names a second kidnapper and claims police covered up errors in the search for his daughter in explosive new book|author=Allan Hall|date=3 April 2013|work=Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Kampusch escaped, Přiklopil was trying to procure false papers as a Czech citizen, in order to "begin a new life" with Kampusch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/crooked-nose-drove-kampusch-kidnapper-claims-his-best-friend-2044822.html Crooked nose drove Kampusch kidnapper claims his best friend], The Independent&lt;/ref&gt;

She suggests that people who use this term about her are disrespectful of her and do not allow her the right to describe and analyse the complex relationship she had with her kidnapper in her own words.

In 2009, Kampusch became the new face of [[animal rights]] group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] in Austria. In June, Kampusch wrote to [[Ilse Aigner]], agriculture minister in Germany where the campaign is based, demanding freedom for zoo animals, stating: "The animals would, if they could, flee as I did, because a life in captivity is a life full of deprivation. It is up to you whether social, intelligent and wonderful creatures are to be freed from their chains and cages where ruthless people keep them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1194077/Cellar-victim-Natascha-Kampusch-strip-animal-rights.html Cellar victim Natascha Kampusch may strip for animal rights], [[Daily Mail]], 19 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Vienna's public prosecutor stated that DNA tests and questioning of witnesses had led to theories being discounted that Přiklopil had an accomplice. Kampusch has also maintained that her captor acted alone.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After reportedly "hundreds of requests for an interview" with the teenager, "with media outlets offering vast sums of money", Kampusch was interviewed by Austrian public broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. The interview was broadcast on 6 September 2006 with her approval.&lt;!-- Wednesday, 18:15 (UTC) and a copy by RTL Television: 19:15 (UTC) --&gt; ORF did not pay for its interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5313762.stm|title=Kidnap girl to give TV interview |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=4 September 2006|accessdate=4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said any proceeds from selling the interview to other channels would be forwarded to Kampusch. The interview was sold to more than 120 countries at a fee of 290 euros per minute. This money, estimated to some hundred thousand euros,&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.extradienst.at/jaos/page/main_heute.tmpl?article_id=18721&amp;offset=0&lt;/ref&gt; was to be donated to women in Africa and Mexico by Kampusch. Likewise she was planning projects to help these women.&lt;ref&gt;''Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung'': Natascha Kampusch - the interview, 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was enormous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1446532.ece|title=Natascha Kampusch: 400 interview requests — that was just the start|work=The Independent|date=11 September 2006|accessdate=11 September 2006|location=London|first=Alexandra|last=Buxton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008134748/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1446532.ece|archivedate=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper ''[[Kronen Zeitung]]'' and news magazine ''[[NEWS (Austrian magazine)|NEWS]]'' also interviewed Kampusch. The interview was published on 6 September 2006. Both press interviews were given in return for a package including housing support, a long-term job offer, and help with her education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2574050|title=Kampusch spricht – am Boulevard|publisher=[[Der Standard|derStandard.at]] |date=6 September 2006|accessdate=8 September 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revelations of mistakes in the interior ministry's investigation of her kidnapping came to light, as well as statements of a policeman which were repeatedly ignored in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On 16 June 2008, the newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' published an in-depth interview with Kampusch by Bojan Pancevski and [[Stefanie Marsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article4044283.ece?print=yes |title=Natascha Kampusch: from darkness to limelight |accessdate=16 June 2008 |last=Pancevski |first=Bojan |author2=Marsh, Stefanie |date=2 June 2008 |publisher=[[The Times|Times Online]] |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615175158/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article4044283.ece?print=yes |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2010, the British TV channel [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] broadcast an hour-long documentary about the case, including an exclusive interview with Kampusch:  ''Natascha: the Girl in the Cellar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Jane|title=Natascha: The girl in the Cellar, FIVE, 8pm|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-previews/natascha-the-girl-in-the-cellar-five-8pm-201922|accessdate=13 March 2017|work=the Daily Mirror|publisher=MGN Limited|date=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natascha: The Girl In The Cellar|url=http://www.documentarytube.com/videos/natascha-the-girl-in-the-cellar|website=DocumentaryTube|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===
The book ''Girl in the Cellar: the Natascha Kampusch Story''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Girl-Cellar-Natascha-Kampusch-Story/dp/0340936487 |title=Girl in the Cellar |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Allan Hall and Michael Leidig appeared in November 2006, written in English. Kampusch's lawyer described the book as being both speculative and premature, and therefore planned to take legal action against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,451732,00.html Skandal-Buch über entführte Natascha erzürnt Familie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711143400/http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,451732,00.html |date=11 July 2007 }}, ''Der Spiegel,'' 30. November 2006. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with two journalists, Kampusch's mother Brigitta Sirny wrote a book about the ordeal, ''Verzweifelte Jahre'' ("Desperate Years"). Kampusch appeared at the initial presentation of the book in August 2007, but did not want to be photographed or interviewed. Sirny writes that she did not have much contact with Kampusch after the escape because Kampusch was shielded from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,499269,00.html "Natürlich verdiene ich daran"] ''Spiegel Online,'' 10 August 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kampusch wrote a book about her ordeal, ''3096 Tage'' (''3,096 Days''), published in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/entfuehrungsfall-kampusch-schreibt-autobiografie_aid_522314.html Entführungsfall: Kampusch schreibt Autobiografie] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted into a German movie, ''[[3096]]'', in 2013.

On 12 August 2016 Natascha Kampusch released her second book titled ''10 Years of Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kampusch|first1=Natascha|title=10 Jahre Freiheit" {{!}} Natascha Kampusch|url=http://natascha-kampusch.at/das-neue-buch-von-natascha-kampusch-10-jahre-freiheit/|website=natascha-kampusch.at|accessdate=13 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Saying No to defeat is the only way to survive" – Interview with Natascha Kampusch|url=http://www.moonproject.co.uk/saying-no-to-defeat-is-the-only-way-to-survive-interview-with-natascha-kampusch/|website=MoonProject|accessdate=13 March 2017|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media endeavors ===
Kampusch established her own website containing personal information including pictures of herself on 5 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natascha-kampusch.at/|title=Natascha Kampusch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had her own talk show on the new Austria TV channel, PULS 4,&lt;!--http://www.puls4.com--&gt; starting on 1 June 2008&lt;!--http://www.kurier.at/kultur/163008.php--&gt;. The show had the working title of ''In Conversation with…Natascha Kampusch'' and eventually premiered as ''Natascha Kampusch trifft'' (''Natascha Kampusch meets...'').&lt;ref name="tvshow"&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a81588/kidnapped-austrian-girl-to-host-own-show.html Kidnapped Austrian girl to host own show] Digital Spy, 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/medien/380538/index.do |title=DiePresse.com |publisher=DiePresse.com |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for only three shows.

On 17 June 2010, German film-maker and director [[Bernd Eichinger]] announced that he was making a film based on Kampusch's captivity and wanted [[Kate Winslet]] to star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/17/kate-winslet-natascha-kampusch | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Natascha Kampusch film director eyes Kate Winslet as lead | first=Xan | last=Brooks | date=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernd Eichinger died on 24 January 2011; Kampusch attended his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German filmmaker Bernd Eichinger dies at 61|work=Reuters|date=25 January 2011|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/25/us-eichinger-idUSTRE70O7W420110125|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Austrian film ''[[Michael (2011 Austrian film)|Michael]]'', which has a plot that resembles the Natascha Kampusch case, was released.

On 15 April 2012, a German newspaper reported that a movie based on her autobiography with the same name was to be made, featuring [[Antonia Campbell-Hughes]] as Kampusch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film review: Natascha Kampusch’s eight years in captivity – distilled into 111 minutes of cinematic brutality in 3096 Days|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=March 2015|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/film-review-natascha-kampuschs-eight-years-in-captivity--distilled-into-111-minutes-of-cinematic-brutality-in-3096-days-8517557.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thure Lindhardt]] as Přiklopil.

=== House ===
[[File:Das Haus von Wolfgang Priklopil.jpg|thumb|Wolfgang Přiklopil's house in [[Strasshof]]]]
The house where Kampusch was imprisoned was built by Přiklopil's grandfather, Oskar Přiklopil, after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="GUARD1206"/&gt; During the [[Cold War]] period, Oskar and his son Karl built a [[Air-raid shelter|bomb shelter]], thought to be the origin of Kampusch's dungeon.  Přiklopil took over the house in 1984 following his grandmother's death.

Kampusch now owns the house in which she was imprisoned, saying, "I know it's grotesque – I must now pay for electricity, water and taxes on a house I never wanted to live in". It was reported that she claimed the house from Přiklopil's estate because she wanted to protect it from vandals and being torn down; she also noted that she has visited it since her escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1316125,00.html|title=Kidnap Victim Owns Her House of Horrors|publisher=Sky News|date=15 May 2008|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the third anniversary of her escape approached, it was revealed she had become a regular visitor at the property and was cleaning it out possibly to move in herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |title=Kampusch to auction off horror house items – Panorama – Austrian Times |work= |accessdate=15 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/688Ynv8tb?url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |archivedate=3 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Kampusch said she had retained the house because it was such a big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1245899/Natascha-Kampusch-If-I-sell-house-I-held-captive-half-years-I-make-sure-cellar-filled-in.html Natascha Kampusch: He put me inside the cellar for eight-and-a-half years, preserved alive like an Egyptian pharaoh], ''Daily Mail''.

==History==
[[General Francisco del Castillo]], a close associate of [[Andres Bonifacio]]. This Aklanon Katipunero was tasked by Bonifacio to establish [[Katipunan]] in [[Panay Island]]. On March 17, 1897, the young patriot, defender of liberty and leader of the Aklan revolutionists was killed by an assassin during a fight in the present-day Pastrana Park. The untimely death of Gen. del Castillo had signaled the end of the major struggle for freedom in Aklan. His close friends, assistants and soldiers were forced to give up arms, some due to the promise of receiving amnesty. These Nineteen Men, weak from hunger and thirst and racked with rain, were bound together and forced into a black hole of a stone cell on Amadeo Street (now Nineteen Martyrs Street) in [[Kalibo]]. Here their hands were manacled and a long bamboo pole was passed through their locked arms across their mangled backs. Then they were strung high up against the wall of the cell, with their backs to the firing line, and during the first hours of March 23, they were shot to death. The few who did not die instantly were bayoneted. That was a night of darkness and terror in [[Kalibo]].
But such promise was quickly broken. So on the fateful day of March 23, 1897, the Martyrs of Aklan were executed. 

==Legacy==
On March 23, 1897, all 19 prisoners were summarily executed by a firing squad in the town square. Their bodies were hastily buried in a mass grave inside a cemetery. By virtue of a Municipal Council resolution, the mortal remains of 19 martyrs were transferred to its present site at corner M. Laserna and Veterans’ Avenue on March 23, 1926.
In order to commemorate the death anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan, Republic Act No. 7806 was made into law setting the 23rd day of March of every year as a special public holiday in the Province of Aklan. A former general himself, President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] let Republic Act 7806 lapsed into law without his signature. And on September 1, 1994, in accordance with Article VI, Sec. 27(1) of the Constitution became law.

On the 102th martyrdom anniversary of the 19 Martyrs of Aklan on March 23, 2018, the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] officially turned over to the Provincial Government of Aklan a tableau memorial in honor of the freedom heroes at the Goding Ramos Park.

Originally, PayPal was a money-transfer service offered by a company called [[Confinity]] which was acquired by [[X.com]] in 1999.

==Legacy==
The PayPal Mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the [[dot-com bust]] of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/DDOH107DLG.DTL|date=May 16, 2008|title=Nonfiction review: 'Once You're Lucky'|author=Marcus Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PayPal Mafia phenomenon has been compared to the founding of [[Intel]] in the late 1960s by engineers who had earlier founded [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] after leaving [[Shockley Semiconductor]].&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; They are discussed in journalist [[Sarah Lacy]]'s book ''Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good.''  According to Lacy,  the selection process and technical learning at PayPal played a role, but the main factor behind their future success was the confidence they gained there. Their success has been attributed to their youth; the physical, cultural, and economic infrastructure of [[Silicon Valley]]; and the diversity of their skill-sets.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; PayPal's founders encouraged tight social bonds among its employees, and many of them continued to trust and support one another after leaving PayPal.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; An intensely competitive environment and a shared struggle to keep the company solvent despite many setbacks also contributed to a strong and lasting camaraderie amongst former employees.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wired|title=How PayPal Gave Rise to a Silicon Valley ‘Mafia’|author=Dylan Tweney|date=November 15, 2007|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2007/11/how-paypal-gave/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prophets in Islam''' ({{lang-ar|الأنبياء في الإسلام}}) include "messengers" (''rasul'', pl. ''rusul''), bringers of a [[Revelation|divine revelation]] via an angel (Arabic: {{lang|ar|ملائكة}}, [[Islamic view of angels|malāʾikah]]);&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaatri, A. I. 2007"&gt;Shaatri, A. I. (2007). Nayl al Rajaa' bisharh' Safinat an'najaa'. Dar Al Minhaj.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Prophet#Islam|prophet]]s" (''nabī'', pl. ''anbiyāʼ''), lawbringers that [[Muslim]]s believe were sent by [[God in Islam|God]] to every person, bringing God's message in a language they can understand.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816054541|pages=559–560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=prophethood+in+islam+encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pTKIVduAEobuoAS0-Yi4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=prophethood%20in%20islam%20encyclopedia&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|30|47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the [[Iman (concept)#The_Six_Articles_of_Faith|six articles of the Islamic faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Basic articles of faith|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813005904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|archive-date=13 August 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, [[Adam]] ([[Adam in Islam|ادم]]), created by Allah (الله). Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 [[prophets in Judaism]] and many [[prophets of Christianity]] are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually in slightly different forms. For example, the Jewish [[Elisha]] is called [[Elisha#In Islam|Eliyas]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] is [[Job in Islam|Ayyub]], [[Jesus]] is [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]], etc. The [[Torah]] given to [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Musa]]) is called ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'', the [[Psalms]] given to [[David]] ([[David in Islam|Dawud]]) is the ''[[Zabur]]'', the [[The gospel|Gospel]] given to Jesus is ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;

Unique to Islam is [[Muhammad]] ([[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad ibn ʿAbdullāh]]), who Muslims believe is the "Seal of the Prophets" (''[[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]'', i.e. the last prophet); and the [[Quran]], revealed to Muhammad but not written down by him,&lt;ref name=denffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Denffer|first=Ahmad von|title=Ulum al-Qur'an : an introduction to the sciences of the Qur an|year=1985|publisher=Islamic Foundation|isbn=0860371328|pages=37|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Muslims believe is unique among divine revelations as the only correct one protected by [[God in Islam|God]] from distortion or corruption,&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding the Qurán'' - Page xii, Ahmad Hussein Sakr - 2000&lt;/ref&gt; destined to remain in its true form until the [[End time|Last Day]].&lt;ref name="The Qur'an Surah 15:9"&gt;{{Cite quran|15|9|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe Muhammad to be the last prophet, although after the prophets there are still [[Wali|saints]]&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'' SUNY Press 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt; (though some modern schools, such as [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], reject the theory of sainthood&lt;ref&gt;Radtke, B., Lory, P., Zarcone, Th., DeWeese, D., Gaborieau, M., F. M. Denny, Françoise Aubin, J. O. Hunwick and N. Mchugh, "Walī", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Muslim belief, every prophet in Islam preached the same main Islamic beliefs, the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]], worshipping of that one God, avoidance of [[Shirk (Islam)|idolatry]] and [[Islamic views on sin|sin]], and the belief in the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]] or the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]] and life after death. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final ''Islamic prophet and messenger'' of [[God in Islam|God]], who would be named "[[Ahmad|Ahmed]] and Muhammad". 

This narrative is found in "Chapter of the Ranks", Qur'an, 61:6 as Allah asked Jesus to remind the Children of Israel but they accused him of the prophecy:

&lt;big&gt;وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَـٰبَنِى إِسْرَٰعِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرىٰةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى ٱسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبينٌ&lt;/big&gt;  

''wa-idh qāla ‘Īsā ’b·nu Maryama: "yā Banī Israā‘īla innī Rasūlu ’llāhi ilay-kum muṣaddiqal li-mā bayna yadayya mina ’t-Tawraāti wa-mubash·shiram bi-Rasūlin ya’tī mim ba‘dī ’s·mu-huū Aḥmadu, fa-lammā jaā’a-hum bi’l-bayyināti, qālū "hādhā siḥrum mubīn!"''

{{quote|&lt;nowiki&gt;And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law [=Torah] (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, "this is evident sorcery!"&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Quran, sura 61 (As-Saf), ''[[ayah]]'' 6|source=}}

== Etymology ==
In Arabic and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|vet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-vet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself "open". Cf. [[Rashbam]]'s comment to {{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''nabī'' (Arabic plural form: &lt;big&gt;أَنْبِيَاء&lt;/big&gt; ''anbiyāʼ'') means "prophet". Forms of this noun occur 75 times in the Quran. The term ''[[nubuwwah]]'' ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;نُبُوَّة&lt;/big&gt; meaning "prophethood") occurs five times in the Quran. The terms ''rasūl'' ([[Arabic]] plural: &lt;big&gt;رُسُل&lt;/big&gt; ''rusul'') and  ''mursal'' ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَل&lt;/big&gt; ''mursal''; plural: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَلُون&lt;/big&gt; ''mursalūn'') denote "messenger with law given/ received by GOD" and occur more than 300 times. The term for a prophetic "message" ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَة&lt;/big&gt; ''risālah''; plural: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَات&lt;/big&gt; ''risālāt''), appears in the [[Quran]] in ten instances.&lt;ref name="EoQP"&gt;Uri Rubin, "Prophets and Prophethood", ''[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syriac language|Syriac form]] of ''rasūl Allāh'' (literally: "messenger of God"), ''s̲h̲eliḥeh d-allāhā'', occurs frequently in the [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] ''[[Acts of Thomas|Acts of St. Thomas]]''. The corresponding verb for ''s̲h̲eliḥeh''—''s̲h̲alaḥ'', occurs in connection with the prophets in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:13-14|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|4:13|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:8|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|1:7|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;A. J. Wensinck, "Rasul", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "prophet" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|نبي}} {{transl|ar|''nabī''}}) and "messenger" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|رسول}} {{transl|ar|''rasūl''}}) appear several times in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]].

In the Hebrew Bible, the word ''[[Nevi'im|nabi]]'' ("spokesperson, prophet") occurs more commonly, and the Hebrew word ''mal'akh'' ("messenger") refers to [[Angels in Judaism]]. According to Judaism, [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zaqariah]], and [[Malachi]] were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year [[Babylonian exile]]. With them, the authentic period of ''[[Prophecy#Judaism|Nevuah]]'' ("prophecy") died,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Vilna Gaon]], based on the opinion that [[Nechemyah]] died in Babylon before 9th Tevet 3448 (313 BCE). Nechemya was governor of [[Yehud Medinata|Persian Judea]] under [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]] in the 5th century BCE. The [[Book of Nehemiah]] describes his work in rebuilding Jerusalem during the [[Second Temple period]]. {{Cite journal | title = Babylonian Talmud | first = Vilna |last=Gaon |authorlink=Vilna Gaon| volume = San.11a, Yom.9a/Yuch.1.14/Kuz.3.39,65,67/Yuch.1/Mag.Av.O.C.580.6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays only the "[[Bath Kol]]" (בת קול, lit. ''daughter of a voice'', "voice of God") exists ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a).

In the New Testament, however, the word "messenger" becomes more frequent, sometimes in association with the concept of a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|3:1|1000}}; [[Gospel of John|John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|17:3|1000}}; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|11:10|1000}}; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:2|1000}}; [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|3:5|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:11|1000}}; [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb||1Corinthians|28:12|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Messenger" may refer to Jesus, to his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] and to John the Baptist. But the last book of the Old Testament, the [[Book of Malachi]], speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet [[John the Baptist]] (Yahya).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] under {{bibleverse||Malachi|2:7|1000}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Malachi|3:1|1000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2018}}
In Muslim belief, every Islamic prophet preached Islam. The beliefs of [[Charity (practice)|charity]], prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to have been taught by every prophet who has ever lived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Quran itself calls Islam the "religion of [[Abraham]]" ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|67|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[Jacob]] ([[Jacob in Islam|Yaqub]]) and the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] as being Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|123|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran says
{{quote|The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah—the which We have sent by inspiration to thee—and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein:...|Quran, sura 42 ([[Ash-Shura]]), ayah 13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Status ===
Islam teaches that prophets were "protected from sin" by God, so unlike lesser human beings they cannot commit a sin.&lt;ref name="Auda-2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Auda |first1=Jasser |title=Were Prophets and Companions Infallible? |url=http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/prophets-companions-infallible/ |website=About Islam |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=Nov 17, 2016 |quote=Regarding the issue of the prophets being sinless or infallible, there is an agreement among scholars that prophets are protected from sins. The protection of all prophets from sins is an Islamic belief, which is a precondition to trusting the prophets’ message and following their example.
However, there is a debate among scholars on whether prophets (peace be upon them all) are subject to error in judgments in “human” matters. The word `issmah (literally: protection) is mentioned in the Quran in the context of the Prophet being protected from people’s whims and Satan’s delusions while he conveys the message of God.
However, the Quran did correct Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on a few occasions in matters of human judgment (Quran 8:67; 9:43; and 80:1-3).
Nevertheless, some scholars rejected the possibility of erring in any prophetic decision whatsoever (for example, Al-Amedi, Al-Ihkaam fi Usul Al-Ahkam, vol.4, p. 99, Dar Al-Kitab Al-Arabi, Beirut, AH 1404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IQA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saalih al-Munajjid |first1=Muhammad |title=248875: Infallibility of the Prophets |url=https://islamqa.info/en/248875 |website=Islam Question and Answer |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=4 January 2017 |quote=The Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allah, may He be exalted, so their words could not be but true and they did not make any mistake, whether deliberate or otherwise, in conveying the message.  They were also infallible and protected from committing major sins such as zina (adultery) and theft.  They were also infallible and protected from committing minor sins that are indicative of baseness, such as stealing a morsel of food or giving short measure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran speaks of the ''Islamic prophets'' as being the greatest human beings of all time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Prophets"&lt;/ref&gt; A prophet, in the Muslim sense of the term, is a person whom God specially chose to teach the faith of Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some were called to prophesy late in life, in Muhammad's case at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Noah"&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as John the Baptist, were called to prophesy while still at a young age and Jesus prophesied while still in his cradle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|30|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Quran verse 4:69 lists various virtuous groups of human beings, among whom prophets (including messengers) occupy the highest rank. Verse 4:69 reads:&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

{{quote|All who obey [[Allah]] and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah—of the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!|Quran, sura 4 (An-Nisa), ''[[ayah]]'' 69&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|69|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Biblical stories retold in the Quran in the Arabic language (e.g., Job, Moses, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] ([[Joseph in Islam|Yusuf]]) etc.) certainly differ from the Jewish [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Greek Old Testament]] and the Greek [[New Testament]], in that the Quran always demonstrates that it is "God's practice" (''[[sunnat Allah]]'') to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. "We have made the [[Shaitan|evil ones]] friends to those without faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|27|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Assuredly God will defend those who believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|22|49|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eoi-84&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosskeen Gibb,|first1=Hamilton Alexander|last2=Pellat|first2=Charles|last3=Schacht|first3=Joseph|last4=Lewis,|first4=Bernard|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|date=1973|publisher=Brill|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic Isa]] did not die on the cross like the Christian thought about Jesus, but deceived his enemies and ascended to heaven.

The prophets and messengers "share no divine attributes", and possess "no knowledge or power" other than that granted to them by God.&lt;ref name=EHHoF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Amriki|first1=Yusuf Talal Ali|last2=Ullah|first2=Qazi Thanaa|title=Essential Hanafi Handbook of Fiqh|date=1985|publisher=Kazi Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numbers ===
Muslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran. The Quran states: "There is a Messenger for every community"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|10|47|t=[[Muhammad Abdel-Haleem|Muhammad A. S.

But Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jazwi disagreed with him and included this hadeeth in his book ''al-Mawdoo‘aat'' (the fabricated hadeeths) and accused Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam of fabricating the hadeeth. There is no doubt that more than one of the imams of ''al-jarh wa’t-ta‘deel'' (evaluation of hadeeth narrators) criticised him because of this hadeeth. "&lt;/ref&gt; and Shu'ayb al-Arna'oot&lt;ref&gt;''Tahqeeq Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan'', 2/79, "Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot said: Its ''isnaad'' is ''da‘eef jiddan'' (very weak) – and he quoted the comments of the scholars about Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam."&lt;/ref&gt; the narration is weak, if not fabricated.

=== Female prophets ===
Most mainstream [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] scholars agree that prophets were males only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = There were no female prophets - Islam web - English|url = http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=31788|website = www.islamweb.net|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}} Still, some like [[Ibn Hazm]], [[Al-Qurtubi|Qartubi]], [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]], and [[Ash'ari|al Ash‘ari]] thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Surat 'Ali `Imran [3:42] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|url = http://legacy.quran.com/3/42|website = legacy.quran.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/158044&lt;nowiki/&gt;With regard to Prophethood, some of the scholars – such as Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari, al-Qurtubi and Ibn Hazm – were of the view that there were some female Prophets! including Maryam bint ‘Imraan. Their evidence is the verses in which it says that Allah, may He be exalted, sent revelation to the mother of Moosa, for example, and what it says about the angels speaking to Maryam (peace be upon her), and also what it says about Allah, may He be exalted, having chosen her above the women of the world.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}}  Also, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]] interprets the Hadith "Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of `Imran; and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh." He said perfection is prophethood, hence his claim that Mary and [[Asiya]] were prophets.&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/7181&lt;nowiki/&gt;The scholars differed as to the meaning of the perfection of women. Some said, it refers to Prophethood.

Ibn Hajar said in "''al-Fath''":

"… it is as if he said: No women attained Prophethood except for So and so and So and so." (''al-Fath'', 6/447).
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptures and other gifts ==

=== Holy books ===
{{See also|Islamic holy books}}
The revealed books are the records which Muslims believe were dictated by God to various Islamic prophets throughout the history of mankind, all these books promulgated the code and laws of Islam. The belief in all the revealed books is an [[Creed#Islamic creed|article of faith]] in Islam and Muslims must believe in all the scriptures to be a Muslim. Muslims believe the Quran, the final holy scripture, was sent because all the previous holy books had been either [[Tahrif|corrupted]] or lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Holy Books"&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Islam speaks of respecting all the previous scriptures, even in their current forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran mentions some Islamic scriptures by name, which came before the Quran:
* ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'' ([[Torah]]): According to the Quran, the Tawrat (Torah) was revealed to Moses,&lt;ref name="Q5336"&gt;{{Cite quran|53|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims believe that the current Pentateuch, although it retains the main message,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|87|18|e=19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suffered corruption over the years. Moses and his brother Haroon ([[Aaron]]) used the Torah to preach the message to the Children of Israel. The Quran implies that the Torah is the longest-used scripture, with the [[Jews|Jewish]] people still using the Torah today, and that all the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] prophets would warn the people of any corruptions that were in the scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|44|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus, in Muslim belief, was the last prophet to be taught the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] in its true form.
* ''[[Zabur]]'' ([[Psalms]]): The Quran mentions the Psalms as being the holy scripture revealed to David. Scholars have often understood the Psalms to have been holy songs of praise.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Psalms"&lt;/ref&gt; The current Psalms are still praised by many Muslim scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Martin Lings, ''Mecca''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdul Malik, ''In Thy Seed''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims generally assume that some of the current Psalms were written later and are not divinely revealed.
* Book of Enlightenment ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;كِتَابُ ٱلْمُنِير&lt;/big&gt; ''Kitābu ’l-Munīr''): The Quran mentions a ''Book of Enlightenment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|35|25|s=ns|b=n}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has alternatively been translated as ''Scripture of Enlightenment'' or the ''Illuminating Book''. It mentions that some prophets, in the past, came with clear signs from God as well as this particular scripture.
* Books of Divine Wisdom ([[Arabic]]: possibly identified as &lt;big&gt;الْزُبُر&lt;/big&gt; ''az-Zubur''): The Quran mentions certain ''Books of Divine Wisdom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by some scholars as ''Books of Dark Prophecies'', which are a reference to particular books vouchsafed to some prophets, wherein there was wisdom for man. Some scholars have suggested that these may be one and the same as the Psalms as their root Arabic word, ''Zubur'' (Quran 35:25) - the plural for the word "Scriptures", comes from the same source as the Arabic ''Zabur'' for the Psalms.
* ''[[Gospel in Islam|İnjil]]'' ([[Gospel]]): The İnjil (Gospel) was the holy book revealed to Jesus, according to the Quran. Although many lay Muslims believe the ''Injil'' refers to the entire New Testament, scholars have clearly pointed out that it refers not to the New Testament but to an original Gospel, which was sent by God, and was given to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary'', Appendix: "On the Injil"&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, according to Muslim belief, the Gospel was the message that Jesus, being divinely inspired, preached to the Children of Israel. The current [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonical Gospels]], in the belief of Muslim scholars, are not divinely revealed but rather are documents of the life of Jesus, as written by various contemporaries, disciples and companions. These Gospels contain portions of Jesus's teachings but do not represent the original Gospel, which was a single book written not by a human but was sent by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Injil"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scrolls of Abraham]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ إِبْرَهِيم ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’Ibrahīm'') The Scrolls of Abraham are believed to have been one of the earliest bodies of scripture, which were vouchsafed to Abraham,&lt;ref name="quran8719"&gt;{{Cite quran|87|19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later used by Ishmael and Isaac. Although usually referred to as 'scrolls/ manuscript', many translators have translated the Arabic ''Suhuf'' as 'the Scriptures'.&lt;ref&gt;Marmaduke Pickthall, ''The Meaning of the Glorious Quran''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scrolls of Abraham are now considered lost rather than corrupted, although some scholars{{who ?|date=May 2018}} have identified them with the [[Testament of Abraham]], an [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic piece of literature]] available in Arabic at the time of Muhammad{{source needed|date=May 2018}}. The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".
* [[Scrolls of Moses]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ مُوسَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Mūsā'') These scrolls, containing the revelations of Moses, which were perhaps written down later by Moses, Aaron and [[Joshua]], are understood by Muslims to refer not to the Torah but to revelations aside from the Torah. Some scholars have stated that they could possibly refer to the [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]],&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lost text spoken of in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 21:14&lt;/ref&gt; The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".

=== Holy gifts ===
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2011}}
The Quran mentions various divinely-bestowed gifts given to various prophets. These may be interpreted as books or forms of celestial knowledge. Although all prophets are believed by Muslims to have been immensely gifted, special mention of "wisdom" or "knowledge" for a particular prophet is understood to mean that some secret knowledge was revealed to him. The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for wisdom and later received it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|26|83|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions that Joseph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|10|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; both attained wisdom when they reached full age; David received wisdom with kingship, after slaying [[Goliath]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|251|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] ([[Lot in Islam|Lut]] received wisdom whilst prophesying in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|21|74|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist received wisdom while still a mere youth;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus received wisdom and was vouchsafed the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|48|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prophethood in Ahmadiyya ===
{{main article|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}
The [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Community]] does not believe that messengers and prophets are different individuals. They interpret the Quranic words ''warner'' (''[[nadhir]]''), ''prophet'', and ''messenger'' as referring to different roles that the same divinely appointed individuals perform. Ahmadiyya distinguish only between law-bearing prophets and non-law-bearing ones. They believe that although law-bearing prophethood ended with Muhammad, non-law-bearing prophethood subordinate to Muhammad continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Alexa|date=2016|title=Placing the Marginalized Ahmadiyya in Context with the Traditional Sunni Majority|url=https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|dead-url=no|journal=3|publisher=Journal of Mason Graduate Research|volume=3|pages=122-123|issn=2327-0764|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006041014/https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|archive-date=2018-10-06|via=Mason Publishing Journals (at [[George Mason University]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e85|title=Ahmadis - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahmadiyya Community recognizes [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] also known as Mirza Qadiani (1835–1908) as such a “prophet” of gods and the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Imam]] [[Mahdi]] of the latter days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirza-Ghulam-Ahmad|title=Mirza Ghulam Ahmad {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam|Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement]] rejects his status as a prophet, instead considering him to be a renewer of the faith.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, all other Muslims and their scholars argue and firmly establish that the Ahmadiyya community are not even Muslim due to the fact their beliefs violate the Muslim belief in Muhammad as the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Other persons ==
The Quran mentions 25 prophets by name but also tells that God (Allah) sent many other prophets and messengers, to all the different nations that have existed on Earth. Many verses in the Qur'an discuss this:
* "We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee...."&lt;ref name="quran4078"&gt;{{cite quran|40|78|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other special persons in the Qur'an ===
* [[Caleb#Quranic account|Caleb (Kaleb)]]: In the Quran, Caleb is mentioned in the 5th [[surah]] of the Quran (5:20-26).
* [[Dhul-Qarnayn]]: Dhul-Qarnayn.  
* [[Joachim#In Islam|Joachim (Imran)]]: The [[Al Imran|Family of Imran]] ([[Arabic]]: '''آل عمران''') is the 3rd chapter of the Quran. ''Imran'' is [[Arabic]] for the biblical figure [[Amram]], the father of Moses and Aaron, who is regarded by Muslims as being the ancestor of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] ([[Mary in Islam|Maryām]]) and Jesus through his son Aaron. In Muslim belief, however, the [[Christian]] Joachim has been attributed the name Imran as well.
* [[Khidr]]: The Quran also mentions the mysterious Khidr (but does not name him), identified at times with [[Melchizedek]], who is the figure that Moses accompanies on one journey. Although most Muslims regard him as an enigmatic saint or an angel,&lt;ref&gt;Jill Caskey, Adam S. Cohen, Linda Safran ''Confronting the Borders of Medieval Art'' BRILL 2011 {{ISBN|978-9-004-20749-3}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt; some see him as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863824465|title=The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism|last=Noegel|first=Scott B.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Brannon M.|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9781461718956|location=Lanham|pages=196-197|oclc=863824465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Luqman]]: The Quran mentions the [[Wise old man|sage]] Luqman in [[Luqman (sura)|the chapter]] named after him, but does not clearly identify him as a prophet. The most widespread Islamic belief&lt;ref&gt;''A-Z of Prophets in Islam'', B. M. Wheeler, "Luqman"&lt;/ref&gt; views Luqman as a [[saint]], but not as a prophet. The Arabic term ''[[wali]]'' (Arabic ولي, plural Awliyā' أولياء) is commonly translated into English as "Saint". However, the wali should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. A key difference is that the wali continues what a prophet taught without any change. However, other Muslims regard Luqman as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Prophets in Islam"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary in Islam|Mary (Maryam)]]: A few scholars (such as [[Ibn Hazm]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|title=Imam Ibn Hazm: On Prophethood of Women|last=Farooq|first=Mohammad Omar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312084433/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|archive-date=2005-03-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=Mohammed Zayki|date=2015|title=Ibn Ḥazm’s theory of prophecy of women: Literalism, logic, and perfection|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|dead-url=no|journal=Intellectual Discourse|publisher=IIUM Press|volume=23|issue=1|pages=76-77|issn=0128-4878|eissn=2289-5639|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006035648/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archive-date=2018-10-05|via=[[CiteSeerX]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; see Maryam (Mary) as a ''nabi'' and a prophetess, since God sent her a message via an angel. The Quran, however, does not explicitly identify her as a prophet. Islamic belief regards her as one of the holiest of women, but not as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond The Exotic: Women's Histories In Islamic Societies'', p. 402. Ed. Amira El-Azhary Sonbol. [[Syracuse University Press]], 2005. {{ISBN|9780815630555}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[People of Ya-Sin|Three persons of the town]]: These three unnamed person, who were sent to the same town, are referenced in [[Ya Sin|chapter 36]] of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|36|13|e=21|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=October 2018}}
* [[Saul#In Islam|Saul]] ([[Talut]]): Saul is not considered a prophet, but a divinely appointed king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2115|title=Saul - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacob#Children of Jacob|Sons of Jacob]]: These men are sometimes not considered to be prophets, although most exegesis scholars consider them to be prophets, citing the hadith of Muhammad and their status as prophets in Judaism. The reason that some do not consider them as prophets is because of their behaviour with Yusuf (Joseph) and that they lied to their father.

=== Other people mentioned in Islamic literature ===
Numerous other people have been mentioned by scholars in the Hadith, [[exegesis]], [[Tafsir|commentary]]. These people include:
* [[Cain and Abel in Islam|Habil]] ([[Abel]])&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

The '''Rat Pack''' is a term used by the media to refer to an informal group of entertainers centered on the [[Las Vegas]] casino scene.  Having its origins in a group of friends that met at the Los Angeles home of [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], by the 1960s, it was the name used by the press and the general public to refer to a later variation of the group that called itself "the Summit" or "the Clan", featuring [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]] and [[Joey Bishop]] among others; they appeared together on stage and in films in the early 1960s, including the movies ''[[Ocean's 11]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=michel, peter |url=http://www.library.unlv.edu/speccol/dino/ratpack.html |title=UNLV Libraries, The Rat Pack, retrieved May 2, 2007 |publisher=Library.unlv.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908094745/http://www.library.unlv.edu/speccol/dino/ratpack.html |archivedate=September 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sergeants 3]]'', and ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' (in the last film, [[Bing Crosby]] replaced Lawford).

[[File:Sabrina9.jpg|left|thumb|[[Humphrey Bogart]], original Rat Pack leader (from [[Sabrina (1954 film)|''Sabrina'', 1954]])]]
The name "The Rat Pack" was first used to refer to a group of friends in New York.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shawn Levy, ''Rat Pack confidential'', Doubleday, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Lawrence J. Quirk and William Schoel, ''The Rat Pack'', Taylor Publishing Company 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Several explanations have been offered for the famous name over the years.  According to one version, the group's original "Den Mother", [[Lauren Bacall]], after seeing her husband, [[Humphrey Bogart]], and his friends return from a night in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], said words to the effect of "You look like a goddamn rat pack."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; "Rat Pack" may also be a shortened version of "[[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California|Holmby Hills]] Rat Pack", a reference to the home of Bogart and Bacall&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; which served as a regular hangout.

Visiting members included [[Errol Flynn]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Cesar Romero]].

According to Stephen Bogart, the original members of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack were: Frank Sinatra (pack master), [[Judy Garland]] (first vice-president), Nicole Bassing (den mother), [[Sid Luft]] (cage master), Bogart (rat in charge of public relations), [[Swifty Lazar]] (recording secretary and treasurer), [[Nathaniel Benchley]] (historian), [[David Niven]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[George Cukor]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Rex Harrison]], and [[Jimmy Van Heusen]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In his autobiography ''[[The Moon's a Balloon]]'', David Niven confirms that the Rat Pack originally included him but neither Sammy Davis, Jr. nor Dean Martin.

==1960s==
The 1960s version of the group included [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Joey Bishop]]. [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Juliet Prowse]], [[Buddy Greco]], and [[Shirley MacLaine]] were often referred to as the "Rat Pack Mascots". 

The post-Bogart version of the group (Bogart died in 1957) was reportedly never called that name by any of its members – they called it ''the Summit'' or ''the Clan''. "The Rat Pack" was a term used by journalists and outsiders, although it remains the lasting name for the group.

Often, when one of the members was scheduled to give a performance, the rest of the Pack would show up for an impromptu show, causing much excitement among audiences, resulting in return visits. They sold out almost all of their appearances, and people would come pouring into Las Vegas, sometimes sleeping in cars and hotel lobbies when they could not find rooms, just to be part of the Rat Pack entertainment experience. The Rat Pack's appearances were of unprecedented value because the city would always become flooded with [[high roller]]s, wealthy gamblers who would routinely leave substantial fortunes in the casinos' coffers. The marquees of the hotels at which they were performing as individuals would read, for example, "DEAN MARTIN - MAYBE FRANK - MAYBE SAMMY" as seen on a [[Sands Hotel]] sign.

Peter Lawford was a brother-in-law of President [[John F. Kennedy]] (dubbed "Brother-in-Lawford" by Sinatra),&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; and Kennedy spent time with Sinatra and the others when he visited Las Vegas, during which members sometimes referred to the group as "the Jack Pack". Rat Pack members played a role in campaigning for Kennedy and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], appearing at the July 1960 [[Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford had asked Sinatra if he would have Kennedy as a guest at his [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] house in March 1962, and Sinatra went to great lengths (including the construction of a [[helipad]]) to accommodate the President.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, pp. 292-293&lt;/ref&gt; When Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] advised his brother to sever his ties to Sinatra because of the entertainer's association with Mafia figures such as [[Sam Giancana]], the stay was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p.293&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy instead chose to stay at rival [[Bing Crosby]]'s estate, which further infuriated Sinatra.&lt;ref name="Spada1"&gt;Spada, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford was blamed for this, and Sinatra "never again had a good word for [him]" from that point onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Spada, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Lawford's role in the upcoming ''[[4 for Texas]]'' was written out, and his part in ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' was given to Bing Crosby.&lt;ref name="Spada1"/&gt;

On June 20, 1965, Sinatra, Martin, and Davis, with [[Johnny Carson]] as the [[Master of Ceremonies|emcee]] (substituting for Bishop, who was out with a bad back), performed their only televised concert together during the heyday of the Pack at the [[Peabody Opera House|Kiel Opera House]] in St. Louis, a closed-circuit broadcast done as a fundraiser for Dismas House (the first halfway house for ex-convicts) and fed live to movie theatres across the country. Thirty years later [[Paul Brownstein]] tracked down a print of the "lost" show in a St. Louis closet after someone noticed mysterious cameras onstage during a CBS documentary on Sinatra which filmed part of the show. It has since been broadcast on [[Nick at Nite]] (in 1998) as part of The [[Museum of Television &amp; Radio]] Showcase series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvclassics.com/ratpack.htm |title=The Rat Pack Captured |publisher=Tvclassics.com |date=1965-06-20 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on DVD as part of the ''Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live &amp; Swingin''.

==Later years==
In 1981, [[Dean Martin]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], appeared together in the film ''[[Cannonball Run (film)|Cannonball Run]]'', and were joined by Sinatra in the sequel ''[[Cannonball Run II]]''. This would be the last time that the three would appear in a movie together ([[Shirley MacLaine]] also appears in the latter film).

==Revival==
[[File:Sammy Davis Jr 1989 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Sammy Davis, Jr. in 1989]]
In December 1987, at [[Chasen's]] restaurant in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, and Martin announced a 29-date tour, called ''Together Again''. At the press conference to announce the tour, Martin joked about calling the tour off, and Sinatra rebuked a reporter for using the term "Rat Pack", referring to it as "that stupid phrase".&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Shawn. ''Rat Pack Confidential''. Fourth Estate. London, 1999. p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Martin's son, [[Dean Paul Martin]], died in a plane crash in March 1987 on the [[San Gorgonio Mountain]] in California, the same mountain where Sinatra's mother, Dolly, was killed in a plane crash ten years earlier. Martin had since become increasingly dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs. Davis had hip replacement surgery two years previously, and was estranged from Sinatra because of Davis' use of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;Haygood, Wil. ''In Black and White: The Life of Sammy Davis, Jr.''. Random House. New York, 2003. p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was also experiencing severe financial difficulties, and was promised by Sinatra's people that he could earn between six and eight million dollars from the tour.&lt;ref name="Haygood p. 466"&gt;Haygood p. 466&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin had not made a film or recorded since 1984, and Sinatra felt that the tour would be good for Martin, telling Davis, "I think it would be great for Dean. Get him out. For that alone it would be worth doing".&lt;ref name="Levy, p. 339"&gt;Levy, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra and Davis still performed regularly, yet had not recorded for several years. Both Sinatra and Martin had made their last film appearances together in 1984's ''Cannonball Run II'', a film which also starred Davis. This marked the trio's first feature film appearance since 1964's ''Robin and the 7 Hoods''. Martin expressed reservations about the tour, wondering whether they could draw as many people as they had in the past. After private rehearsals, at one of which Sinatra and Davis had complained about the lack of black musicians in the orchestra,&lt;ref name="Haygood p. 466"/&gt; the tour began at the [[Oracle Arena|Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena]] on March 13, 1988, to a sold-out crowd of 14,500.&lt;ref name="Levy, p. 339"/&gt; 

Davis opened the show, followed by Martin and then Sinatra; after an interval, the three performed a medley of songs. During the show, Martin threw a lit cigarette at the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Anthony, Swan, Robbyn. ''Sinatra: The Life''. Corgi. New York, 2006 p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin withdrew from the tour after just five shows, with the official reason stated as being a flare-up of a kidney problem. Sinatra and Davis continued the tour under the title "The Ultimate Event" with [[Liza Minnelli]] replacing Martin as the third member of the trio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Takiff |first1=Jonathan |title=Frank, Liza &amp; Sammy The Ultimate Event! |url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-09-27/news/26230935_1_susan-reynolds-sammy-davis-frank-sinatra |accessdate=2016-05-01 |work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |date=1988-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis's associate stated that Sinatra's people were skimming the top of the revenues from the concerts, as well as stuffing envelopes full of cash into suitcases after the performances.&lt;ref&gt;Birkbeck, Matt. ''Deconstructing Sammy''. Amistad. New York, 2008. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1989, after Davis experienced throat pain, he was diagnosed with throat cancer which caused his death in May 1990. Davis was buried with a gold watch that Sinatra had given him at the conclusion of ''The Ultimate Event Tour''.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Swan, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1988 performance of ''The Ultimate Event'' in Detroit was recorded and shown on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] the following year as a tribute to the recently deceased Davis. A review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Davis's performance, describing him as "pure, ebullient, unapologetic show business."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957179,00.html |title= With Sammy Davis, the Spirit Lingers |accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=The New York Times | date=March 6, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
Concerning the group's reputation for womanizing and heavy drinking, [[Joey Bishop]] stated in a 1998 interview: "I never saw Frank, Dean, Sammy or Peter drunk during performances. That was only a gag! And do you believe these guys had to chase broads? They had to chase 'em away!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,139509,00.html time.com]{{spaced ndash}}

Archival footage of Lawford and Sinatra were used in the 1974 compilation film ''[[That's Entertainment!]]''.

[[Shirley MacLaine]] appeared in the 1958 film ''Some Came Running'' along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate [[David Niven]], and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his face toward the camera during a scene featuring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[George Raft]]. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]''. She also had an appearance in the 1960 film ''Ocean's 11'' as a drunken woman. The 1984 film ''Cannonball Run II'', with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.

A biopic, ''[[The Rat Pack (film)|The Rat Pack]]'', made by [[HBO]] in 1998, starred [[Ray Liotta]] as Sinatra, [[Joe Mantegna]] as Martin and [[Don Cheadle]] as Davis, dramatizing their private lives and, in particular, their roles in the 1960 presidential campaign of [[John F. Kennedy]].

==Music==
''[[Christmas with the Rat Pack]]'', a collection of holiday tunes sung by Sinatra, Martin and Davis, was released in 2001. ''[[The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live &amp; Swingin']]'' went on sale in 2003. A concert featuring the three men, ''[[Sands Hotel|Live from the Sands]]'' in [[Las Vegas]], also is available on CD.

==Stage==
''[[The Rat Pack: Live from Las Vegas]]'' tribute show originated on stage in [[London]] in 2000 and has been running continuously since then throughout Europe and North America.

[[Image:Beerajam 0011.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of Satanaya in [[Beer Ajam]], [[Syria]].]]
'''Satanaya''' ([[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] Сэтэнай {{IPA-cau|satanaːj|}}; [[Kabardian language|Kabardian ]] Сэтэней {{IPA-cau|satanaj|}}; [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] {{IPA-cau|satanaja|}}; [[Ossetic language|Ossetian]] Сатана '''Satana''') is a [[mythology|myth]]ological figure who appears in many cycles of the [[Nart sagas]] of the [[Caucasus]].

Satanaya is the mother of the Narts, a [[fertility]] figure who is also an authority over her children. She is often cast in the light of a "wise woman" or [[matriarch]], which mirrors the relative freedom of women in [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] societies generally. Satanaya can be compared to the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Demeter]], with whom she shares many traits.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In Ossetian tradition, she is the daughter of [[Uastyrdzhi]] (St. George).

The Chechen-Ingush version is somewhat different in that the counterpart of Satanaya, Sela-Sata, is primarily a goddess of [[crafts]] and women's work rather than a Nartic matriarch. However, many of her characteristics, including the story of her miraculous birth of a dead Nart mother and her involvement in the birth of chief hero Seska-Solsa ([[Sosruko]]), correspond closely to those of Satanaya in the other versions.&lt;ref&gt;Tsaroïeva, Mariel. Anciennes Croyances des Ingouches et des Tchetchenes. Pp. 195, 235. {{ISBN|2-7068-1792-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes of the Nart Saga including Satanaya==

In "Why the Sun Pauses at the Horizon at Sunset", Satanaya makes a bet that she can weave a coat in one day, and has to ask the sun for a favour, to slow down, that she may finish her task before the day is through.

In "Lady Satanaya's Blossom", Satanaya finds a beautiful flower by the river Kuban and plucks it and replants it in front of her house. The next day, she is sad to discover that it has withered. Once again she goes and plucks another of the same flower, only to see the same result the following morning. The third time she re-plants a flower in front of her house, it rains, and the flower is invigorated and continues to live on until the next day. Satanaya realizes the importance of water to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colarusso|first=John|authorlink=John Colarusso|title=The Woman of the Myths: The Satanaya Cycle|url=http://www.aheku.net/datas/users/1-satanaya_cycle.pdf|work=The Annual of the Society for the Study of Caucasia 2: 3-11., 1989|publisher=McMaster University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211025003/http://www.aheku.net/datas/users/1-satanaya_cycle.pdf|archivedate=2014-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''seventy disciples''' or '''seventy-two disciples''' (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the '''Seventy[-two] Apostles''') were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to ({{bibleref2|Luke|10:1}}) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521–524; 543–545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''. Although apostles and disciples exist in many extant churches and denominations, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] is the only current one to use [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|Seventy]] as a title for a priesthood office.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=25|showsource=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text ==

The passage from [[Luke 10]] reads (in [[Young's Literal Translation]]):{{quote|
And after these things, the Lord did appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to every city and place whither he himself was about to come, then said he unto them, `The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.

`Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves; carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way;  and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to this house; and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn back. `And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthy [is] the workman of his hire; go not from house to house, and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you, and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you.

`And into whatever city ye do enter, and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say, And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of God hath come nigh to you; and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city. `Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed; but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you. `And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down. `He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me away, doth put away Him who sent me.'

And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, `Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;' and he said to them, `I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen; lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you; but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–20|YLT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Analysis ==
This is the only mention of the group in the [[Bible]]. The number is ''seventy'' in some manuscripts of the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] (such as [[Codex Sinaiticus]]) and [[Caesarean text-type|Caesarean]] text traditions but ''seventy-two'' in most other Alexandrian and [[Western text-type|Western]] texts. It may derive from the [[Sons of Noah|seventy nations of Genesis 10]] or the many other occurrences of the number seventy in the Bible, or the seventy-two translators of the [[Septuagint]] from the [[Letter of Aristeas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek NT''&lt;/ref&gt; In translating the ''[[Vulgate]]'', [[Jerome]] selected the reading of seventy-two.

The ''Gospel of Luke'' is not alone among the [[synoptic gospels]] in containing multiple episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on missions. The first occasion ({{bibleref2|Luke|9:1–6}}) is closely based on the "limited commission" mission in ''[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]'' {{bibleref2|Mark|6:6–13}}, which however recounts the sending out of the [[twelve apostles]], rather than seventy, though with similar details. The parallels (also [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|9:35}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:1}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:5–42}}) suggest a common origin in the hypothesized [[Q document]]. Luke also mentions the [[Great Commission]] to "all nations" ({{bibleref2|Luke|24:44–49}}) but in less detail than Matthew's account and {{bibleverse|Mark|16:19–20}} mentions the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]].

What has been said to the seventy (two) in {{bibleref2|Luke|10:4}} is referred in passing to the Twelve in {{bibleref2|Luke|22:35}}:
:He said to them, "When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?" "No, nothing," they replied.

The [[feast day]] commemorating the seventy is known as the "[[Synaxis]] of the Seventy Apostles" in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is celebrated on [[January 4 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|January 4]]. Each of the seventy apostles also has individual commemorations scattered throughout the [[liturgical year]] (see [[Eastern Orthodox Church calendar]]).

== The record by Pseudo-Hippolytus ==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] was a disciple of [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]], a disciple of [[Apostle John]]. Hippolytus's works were considered lost prior to their discovery at a monastery on [[Mount Athos]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 3&lt;/ref&gt; While his major work ''The Refutation of All Heresies'' was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, ''On the Twelve Apostles of Christ'' and ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'', are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 254–56&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [[James the Just|James the Lord's brother]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Cleopas]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], who supplied the vacant place in the number of the twelve apostles.
# [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Thaddeus]], who conveyed the epistle to Augarus ([[Abgar V]]).
# [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]], who baptized Paul, and was bishop of Damascus.
# [[St Stephen|Stephen]], the first martyr.
# [[Philip the Evangelist|Philip]], who baptized the eunuch.
# [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], bishop of Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.
# [[Nicanor the Deacon|Nicanor]] died when Stephen was martyred.

# [[Parmenas]], bishop of Soli.
# [[Nicolas the Deacon|Nicolaus]], bishop of Samaria.
# [[Barnabas]], bishop of Milan.
# [[Mark the Evangelist]], bishop of Alexandria.
# [[Luke the Evangelist]].
These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.

He sought out Paul when everyone else was afraid of him, bringing him to the apostles.  It was Barnabas whom the apostles first sent to [[Antioch]] with Paul. Their long association was broken only when Barnabas was determined to take his cousin Mark, whom Paul did not trust just then, on a missionary journey. The three were later reconciled.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

The price of the bribes paid to the killers was billed to the family of the deceased as an additional funeral charge. The perpetrators were apprehended in 2002. Their descriptive designation was coined by a newspaper article which first brought the story to the public's attention.

==Case==
On January 20, 2007 four employees from a hospital casualty department in Łódź were sentenced. The perpetrators were shown to have killed mostly elderly patients using the muscle relaxant [[pancuronium]] (brand name Pavulon).&lt;ref&gt;This is one of the drugs administered during a [[lethal injection]] in the [[United States]]. It was also used by medical [[serial killer]] [[Efren Saldivar]].&lt;/ref&gt; The four workers then sold information about the deceased patients to funeral homes, so they could contact the relatives before other funeral homes could. They exacted bribes ranging from 12,000 to over 70,000 [[zloty]].&lt;ref name=warsawvoice&gt;http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/13662/&lt;/ref&gt;

The killers are:
* [[Paramedic]] Andrzej Nowocień was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of four patients and for helping Karol Banaś in a further murder. He confessed to more than 50 murders to a cellmate.&lt;ref name=wyborcza(pl)&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,82452,3020270.html |title=Proces łowców skór: Chwalił się, jak zabijał |language=pl |publisher=Wyborcza.pl |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paramedic Karol Banaś was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for the "particularly cruel" ("szczególnie okrutne") murder of Ludmiła Ś. and for helping Andrzej Nowocień murder  the other patients.
* [[Physician|Doctor]] Janusz Kuliński was sentenced to six years and banned from practising medicine for 10 years, for willfully endangering 10 patients.
* Doctor Paweł Wasilewski was sentenced to five years and banned from practising medicine for 10 years for the willful endangering of four patients.

Their sentences were upheld by the Łódź Appeal Court in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prawo.gazetaprawna.pl/artykuly/28928,lekarze_skazani_w_procesie_lowcow_skor_stawili_sie_w_areszcie.html gazetaprawna.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; Further appeal was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Poland]] on October 27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,91446,7197501,Sprawa__lowcow_skor____kasacje_oddalone__wyroki_ostateczne.html |title=Sprawa "łowców skór" - kasacje oddalone, wyroki ostateczne |date=28 October 2009 |publisher= [[Gazeta Wyborcza]]|accessdate=3 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;
The investigation into the scandal is still ongoing and a total of forty other members of the casualty department are under investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/0,1559188,0,1,kolejni-lowcy-skor-za-kratami,wiadomosc.html |title=Kolejni "łowcy skór" za kratami |publisher=Tvn24.pl |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are the owners of a local funeral home for receiving information regarding the deaths of patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34384,3863336.html gazeta.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral home added the cost of the [[bribery|bribes]] it paid to the killers to the bills that the families of the deceased paid for their funerals.&lt;ref name=warsawvoice/&gt;

==Discovery==
The scandal was first brought to public attention on January 23, 2002 in an article in the Polish newspaper ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' by {{Interlanguage link multi|Tomasz Patora|pl}}, Marcin Stelmasiak and Przemysław Witkowski. They described how the hospital workers or paramedics would call funeral homes regarding patient deaths in order to receive a [[bribe]], and sometimes even killed patients. The dead patients were called "skins" and so the article was called "Skin Hunters" (''Łowcy skór'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34384,656146.html gazeta.pl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 2003, a film ''Skin Hunters'' (''{{Interlanguage link multi|Łowcy skór|pl}}'') was made of the case starring [[Piotr Adamczyk]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385061/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a documentary of the events, ''Necrobusiness'', was made by a Swedish company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1244098/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spouse''' is a [[life partner]] in a [[marriage]], [[civil union]], or [[common-law marriage]]. The term is [[gender neutral]], whereas a male spouse is a [[husband]] and a female spouse is a [[wife]]. Although a spouse is a form of [[significant other]], the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.

==Legal status==
{{Further information|Coverture|Marital power}}
The legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly among the jurisdictions of the world. These regulations are usually described in [[family law]] statutes. However, in many parts of the world, where [[civil marriage]] is not that prevalent, there is instead customary marriage, which is usually regulated informally by the community. In many parts of the world, spousal rights and obligations are related to the payment of [[bride price]], [[dowry]] or [[dower]]. Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to male marital partners that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to female marital partners. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) “The Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. August 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings {{cite web |url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824032832/http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and France &lt;ref&gt;Although married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965,[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf] and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. [https://terapiadeparejaweb.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s. In various [[marriage laws]] around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of [[Iran]] states at Article 1105: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311161504/http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on jurisdiction, the refusal or inability of a spouse to perform the marital obligations may constitute a [[ground for divorce]], [[legal separation]] or [[annulment]]. The latter two options are more prevalent in countries where the dominant religion is [[Roman Catholicism]], some of which introduced divorce only recently (i.e. [[Italy]] in 1970, [[Portugal]] in 1975, [[Brazil]] in 1977,  [[Spain]] in 1981, [[Argentina]] in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-12/news/mn-3473_1_divorce-law|title=Divorce Is Now Legal in Argentina but, So Far, Few Couples Have Taken the Break|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paraguay]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies'', by Mala Htun, pp 102&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colombia]] in 1991,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''note''': divorce between 1976-1991 was allowed for non-Catholics&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]] in 1996, [[Chile]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chile introduces right to divorce | date = November 18, 2004 | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malta]] in 2011). In recent years, many Western countries have adopted [[no fault divorce]]. In some parts of the world, the formal dissolution of a marriage is complicated by the payments and goods which have been exchanged between families (this is common where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]]). This often makes it difficult to leave a marriage, especially for the woman: in some parts of Africa, once the bride price has been paid, the wife is seen as belonging to the husband and his family; and if she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf |title=Protecting the Girl Child: Using the Law to End Child, Early and Forced Marriage and Related Human Rights Violations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-29 |website=equalitynow.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}

Regardless of legislation, personal relations between spouses may also be influenced by local [[culture]] and [[religion]], which may promote male authority over the wife: for instance the word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with ''owner'' and ''master''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minimum age==
There is often a minimum legal [[marriageable age]]. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/MarryingTooYoung.pdf |title=Marrying Too Young - End Child Marriage |author=United Nations Population Fund UNFPA |date=2012 |website=www.unfpa.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In 2010, 158 countries reported that 18 years was the minimum legal age for marriage for women without parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority. However, in 146 countries, state or customary law allows girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of parents or other authorities; in 52 countries, girls under age 15 can marry with parental consent. In contrast, 18 is the legal age for marriage without consent among males in 180 countries. Additionally, in 105 countries, boys can marry with the consent of a parent or a pertinent authority, and in 23 countries, boys under age 15 can marry with parental consent."

==Procreation==
[[File:Kustodiev Merchants Wife.jpg|thumb|180px|''The Merchant's Wife'' (1918) by [[Boris Kustodiev]]. A wife is a spouse.]]
Although in Western countries spouses sometimes [[Childfree|choose not to have children]], such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world.  In some cultures and religions, the quality of a spouse imposes an obligation to have children. In [[northern Ghana]], for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choosing a spouse==
There are many ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include [[love marriage]], [[arranged marriage]], and [[forced marriage]]. The latter is in some jurisdictions a [[void marriage]] or a [[voidable marriage]]. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/part/10/enacted|title=Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Women are Persons-two.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louise McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], Famous Five statue, [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]]]]
'''The Famous Five''', or '''The Valiant Five''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kome|first=Penney|title=Women of Influence: Canadian Women and Politics|year=1985|publisher=Doubleday Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-385-23140-4|pages=31–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=CBF8UvjlN8KiyAGu3IHwDg&amp;id=hBQqAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22valiant+five%22+emily+murphy&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22valiant+five%22|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-fr|Célèbres cinq}}) were five Alberta women who asked the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to answer the question, "Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]], include female persons?" in the case ''[[Edwards v Canada (AG)|Edwards v Canada]].''&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite book | first=Brian| last=Brennan| title=Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference| year=2001| publisher= Fifth House| page= 14| isbn= 1-894004-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five women, [[Emily Murphy]], [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]], [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]], [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], created a petition to ask this question. They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irene Parlby===
{{Main|Irene Parlby}}
In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during [[World War I]] and later served on the Board of Governors of the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Nellie McClung===
{{Main|Nellie McClung}}
Nellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations.  She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Board of the Governors.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;  In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt; She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Louise McKinney===
{{Main|Louise McKinney}}
Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the [[United Church of Canada]], and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Henrietta Muir Edwards===
{{Main|Henrietta Muir Edwards}}
Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt; and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.
