[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|27 Club graffiti in Tel Aviv depicting several members of the club.]]
The '''27 Club''' is a list of [[popular music]]ians, artists, or actors who died at age 27. It originated with an unsupported claim of a "statistical spike" for the death of musicians at that age, but this has been repeatedly disproved by research.

It remains a cultural [[meme]], documenting the deaths of celebrities, some noted for their high-risk lifestyles. Names are often put forward for inclusion, but because the club is entirely notional, there is no official membership.

Statistical studies have failed to find any unusual pattern of musician deaths at this age, comparing it to equally small increases at ages 25 and 32, with a 2011 ''[[The BMJ|BMJ]]'' study noting instead that [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]] musicians have a higher death rate than the rest of the young adult population, concluding: "Fame may increase the risk of death among musicians, but this risk is not limited to age 27".&lt;ref name="BMJStudy"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.bmj.com/press-releases/2011/12/20/27-really-dangerous-age-famous-musicians-retrospective-cohort-study | title=Is 27 really a dangerous age for famous musicians?

The "club" has been repeatedly cited in music magazines, journals and the daily press. Several exhibitions have been devoted to the idea, as well as novels, films and stage plays.&lt;ref name="history-of-the-27-club-book"&gt;{{Cite book|title=27: A History of the 27 Club through the Lives of Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse|isbn=978-0306821684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the-27-club-book"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 27 Club: Why Age 27 Is Important|isbn=978-0473206840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the-27s"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll|isbn=978-0615189642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curse-of-27-book"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Curse of 27: They Have Three Things in Common.

Cobain and Hendrix biographer [[Charles R. Cross]] wrote, four years before the ''BMJ'' study was published, "The number of musicians who died at 27 is truly remarkable by any standard. [Although] humans die regularly at all ages, there is a statistical spike for musicians who die at 27."&lt;ref name="cross-seattlepi"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/writers/304767_writer23.html |title= P-I's Writer in Residence Charles R.

== History ==
[[File:Jim Morrison 1969.JPG|right|thumb|Jim Morrison, lead singer of the rock band [[the Doors]]]]
[[Brian Jones]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]] all died at the age of 27 between 1969 and 1971. At the time, the coincidence gave rise to some comment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Nesta Roberts |title= Flower bower |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= September 10, 1971 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= James Riordan | author2 = Jerry Prochnicky | title = Break on Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison | publisher = It Books | year= 1992 | isbn = 978-0-688-11915-7 | pages = 416, 467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until the 1994 [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|death]] of [[Kurt Cobain]] at age 27, that the idea of a "27 Club" began to catch on in public perception.&lt;ref name="cross-seattlepi"/&gt;

According to Hendrix and Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross, the growing importance of the media—Internet, television and magazines—and the response to an interview of Cobain's mother were jointly responsible for such theories. An excerpt from a statement that Cobain's mother, Wendy Fradenburg Cobain O'Connor, made in the [[Aberdeen, Washington]], newspaper ''[[The Daily World (Aberdeen)|The Daily World]]''—"Now he's gone and joined that stupid club. I told him not to join that stupid club."—referred to Hendrix, Joplin, and Morrison dying at the same age, according to Cross.&lt;ref name="cross-357"&gt;{{cite book | author = Charles R. Cross | title = Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain | publisher = Hyperion |year = 2002 | page = 357 | edition = 2nd |isbn = 978-0-7868-8402-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors share his view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = R. Gary Patterson | title = Take a Walk on the Dark Side: Rock and Roll Myths, Legends, and Curses | page = 259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Eric Segalstad, writer of ''[[The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll]]'', assumed that Cobain's mother referred to the death of his two uncles and his great-uncle, all of whom had also committed suicide.&lt;ref name="the27s-12"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Josh Hunter | author2 = Eric Segalstad | title = The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll | publisher = Samadhi Creations | location = Berkeley Lake | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-615-18964-2 | page = 12 | url = http://the27s.com/ | accessdate =September 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919002136/http://www.the27s.com/| archivedate=September 19, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cross, the events have led a "set of conspiracy theorists [to suggest] the absurd notion that Kurt Cobain intentionally timed his death so he could join the 27 Club".&lt;ref name="cross-seattlepi" /&gt;

In 2011, seventeen years after Cobain's death, [[Amy Winehouse]] died at the age of 27, prompting a renewed swell of media attention devoted to the club once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amy Winehouse, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain and the 27 Club|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/amy-winehouse-jimi-hendrix-kurt-cobain-and-the-27-club/2011/07/23/gIQAiLAhVI_blog.html|agency=The Washington Post|issue=July 23, 2011|date=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years earlier, she had expressed a fear of dying at that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/13488/stating-the-obvious-amy-winehouse-fears-early-death/ |title=The Inquisitr: Stating the Obvious, Amy Winehouse |date=December 28, 2008 |publisher=Inquisitr.com |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual does not necessarily have to be a musician to qualify as a member of the 27 Club. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included television actor [[Jonathan Brandis]], who committed suicide in 2003, in a list of "members" of the 27 Club.&lt;ref name="RS-A-Brief-History"/&gt; [[Anton Yelchin]], who had played in a punk rock band but was primarily known as a film actor, was also described as a member of the club upon his death in 2016.&lt;ref name="yelchinbbc"/&gt; Likewise, [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] has been included in 27 Club lists, despite the relative brevity of his music career and his prominence as a graffiti artist and painter.&lt;ref name=Yahoo /&gt;&lt;ref name=BuzzFeed /&gt;

== Scientific studies ==

A study published in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' in December 2011 concluded that there was no increase in the risk of death for musicians at the age of 27. Although the sampled musicians faced an increased risk of death in their 20s and 30s, this was not limited to the age of 27.&lt;ref name="BMJStudy" /&gt; A 2015 article in ''[[The Independent]]'' also provided statistical evidence that popular musicians are not more likely to die at the age of 27.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Dianna Theodora (April 2, 2015). [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/why-the-27-club-is-a-myth-jimi-hendrix-and-amy-winehouse-may-be-members-but-that-doesnt-make-it-real-10152675.html "Why the 27 Club Is a Myth: Jimi Hendrix and Amy Winehouse May Be Members But That Doesn't Make It Real"], ''The Independent''.

The song title "27" by [[Fall Out Boy]] from their album ''[[Folie a Deux (album)|Folie à Deux]]'' is a reference to the club.  The song explores the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyles common in rock and roll.  [[Pete Wentz]], the primary lyricist of Fall Out Boy, wrote the song because he felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Stevie Chick meets"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/24/falloutboy-popandrock|title=Chemical brothers|last=Chick|first=Stevie|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2011|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his song "Brand Name" from the album ''[[GO:OD AM]]'', [[Mac Miller]] says "To everyone who sell me drugs, don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hoping not to join the twenty-seven club."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Mac-miller-brand-name-lyrics|title=Brand Name by Mac Miller|website=Genius|access-date=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller himself died on September 7, 2018, at the age of 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mac-miller-dead-at-26-720756|title=Mac Miller Dead at 26|author=Klinkenberg, Brendan|website=Rolling Stone|date=September 7, 2018|access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His autopsy revealed that cause of death was an accidental overdose of [[Fentanyl#Overdose|fentanyl, cocaine]] and alcohol.&lt;ref name=cause&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mac-miller-cause-of-death-fentanyl-cocaine-alcohol-751974/|title=Mac Miller’s Cause of Death: Accidental Fentanyl, Cocaine Overdose|date=2018-11-05|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[Colors (Halsey song)|Colors]]" by [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] references the club with the lyric, "I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.papermag.com/halsey-new-americana-1510217196.html |title=''Halsey On Being A Gossip Magnet, Growing Up Emo, And How People Missed The Satire In "New Americana"'' |author= Lobenfeld, Claire |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Paper Magazine|access-date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "27 Club" by [[Ivy Levan]] released as a promotional single for her debut album ''[[No Good (album)|No Good]]'' released in 2015 is a reference to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iamhighvoltage.com/2015/08/12/no-good-by-ivy-levan|title=NO GOOD BY IVY LEVAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Administratium''' is a well-known [[in-joke]] in [[science|scientific]] circles and is a [[parody]] both on the [[bureaucracy]] of [[academia|scientific establishments]] and on descriptions of newly discovered [[chemical element]]s. 

In 1991, Thomas Kyle (the supposed discoverer of this element) was awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for [[physics]], making him one of only three fictional people to have won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V111/N40/ignobe.40n.html |title=Ig Nobel Prizes Debut |publisher=The Tech |first=Alice |last=Gilchrist |issue=40 |volume=111 |date=October 4, 1991 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spoof article was written by [[William DeBuvitz]] in 1988 and first appeared in print in the January 1989 issue of ''The Physics Teacher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315075433/http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/administ.htm |title=Administratium. New chemical Element Discovered |first=William |last=DeBuvitz |publisher= The Physics Teacher |date=January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread rapidly among university campuses and research centers; many versions surfaced, often customized to the contributor's situation.

A similar joke concerns '''Administrontium''' which was referenced in print in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebeltz.net/resume/jir.html |title=Physics Non-Department First to Photograph New Element. |first=Ellin |last=Beltz |publisher=NEIU Independent |date=June 21, 1993 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation on the same joke is '''Bureaucratium'''. A commonly heard description describes it as "having a negative [[half-life]]". In other words, the more time passes, the more massive "Bureaucratium" becomes; it only grows larger and more sluggish. This refers to the bureaucratic system, which is generally perceived as a system in which bureaucratic procedures accumulate, and whatever needs to get done takes increasingly longer to get done as soon as it touches the bureaucracy.

'''Billy Yank''' or '''Billy Yankee''' is the personification of the [[Northern United States|Northern states]] of the [[United States]], or less generally, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell Irvin Wiley. 1952. The Life of Billy Yank: The Common Soldier of the Union. Indianapolis: Charter Books. Pages 454.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of his name is derived from ''[[yankee]]'', a slang term for [[New England]]ers. Political cartoonists used Billy Yank and his [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] counterpart [[Johnny Reb]] to symbolize the [[combatants]] in the American Civil War of the 1860s.

Billy Yank is usually pictured wearing a regulation Yankee wool uniform that included the [[fatigue blouse]], a light-weight wool coat with an inside pocket and four brass buttons on the front, with a [[kepi]]-style forage cap made of wool broadcloth with a rounded, flat top, cotton lining, and leather visor.

==Comics==
In the universe of the [[DC Comics]], the "Spirit of America" appeared first in human form as the [[Minuteman]] and then [[Brother Jonathan]] before splitting in two during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war, the two halves of its essence ([[Johnny Reb]] and Billy Yank) recombined to form [[Uncle Sam]].

{{Politics}}
The interdisciplinary study of '''biology and political science''' is the application of theories and methods from the biology toward the scientific understanding of [[political behavior]]. The field is sometimes called '''[[biopolitics]]''', a term that will be used in this article as a synonym although it has other, less related meanings. More generally, the field has also been called "[[politics]] and the [[life sciences]]".&lt;ref&gt;Blank, Robert H., and Samuel M. Hines. 2001. ''Biology and Political Science''. New York: Routledge; Somit, A., and S. A. Peterson. 1998. "Review article: Biopolitics after three decades - A balance sheet." British Journal of Political Science 28:559-71; Masters, Roger D. 1989. ''The Nature of Politics''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
The field can be said to originate with the 1968 manifesto of [[Albert Somit]], ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', which appeared in the ''[[Midwest Journal of Political Science]]''.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Maxwell|title=The Sociobiological Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OPxMX-2h2cC&amp;pg=PA142|year=1991|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0768-4|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{jstor|2110295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biopolitics" was appropriated for this area of study by [[Thomas Thorton]], who used it as the title of his 1970 book.&lt;ref name="Maxwell1991"/&gt;

The [[Association for Politics and the Life Sciences]] was formed in 1981 and exists to study the field of biopolitics as a subfield of political science. APLS owns and publishes an academic peer-reviewed journal called ''Politics and the Life Sciences'' (PLS). The journal is edited in the [[United States]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]’s School of Public Policy, in [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Politics and the Life Sciences|url=http://www.aplsnet.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1990s and since, biopolitics research has expanded rapidly, especially in the areas of [[evolutionary theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Sidanius, Jim, and Robert Kurzban. 2003. "Evolutionary Approaches to Political Psychology." In ''Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology'', ed. D. O. Sears, L. Huddie and R. Jervis. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[genetics]],&lt;ref&gt;Alford, J. R., C. L. Funk, and J. R. Hibbing. 2005. "Are political orientations genetically transmitted?" American Political Science Review 99 (2):153-67; Hatemi, Peter K., Carolyn L. Funk, Hermine Maes, Judy Silberg, Sarah E. Medland, Nicholas Martin, and Lyndon Eaves. 2009. "Genetic Influences on Political Attitudes over the Life Course." Journal of Politics 71 (3):1141-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Darren. 2011. "From SCAN to Neuropolitics. In ''Man is By Nature a Political Animal'', edited by P. K. Hatemi and R. McDermott. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical link between biology and politics on the one hand, and sociological organicism on the other, is inescapable.  The essential difference here is that the early modern application of biological ideas to politics revolved around the idea that society was a ‘social organism’, whereas the subject this article describes expressly sets out to separate the essential logic of the association of biology to human social life, from this earlier model.  Hence the emphasis upon ‘politics’, denoting the primacy of the individual who engages in social life, as in political behaviour, underpinned by biological foundations.  In this sense the rise of Biopolitics represents the replacement of sociological organicism that had been eradicated by the end of the Second World War, with an acceptable form of political organicism.  Some discussion bearing on this point may be found in ''Biology and Politics : Recent Explorations'' by Albert Somit, 1976, which is a collection of essays, one brief essay by William Mackenzie is ''Biopolitics : A Minority Viewpoint'', in which he talks about the ‘founding father’ of Biopolitics as being Morley Roberts, because of his 1938 book of that name.  But Roberts was not using the term in its modern, politically sanitized sense, but in the context of society viewed as a true living being, a social organism.  And in a reply to Somit’s ''Towards a more Biologically Oriented Political Science'', published in the same journal, we find ''Some Questions about a More Biologically Oriented Political Science'' by Jerone Stephens, which sets out to warn against lurching back into the errors of previous venturers into the realms of biology and politics, as in sociological organicism.

[[File:BÁRÁNYLES KERESZT.JPG|thumb|right|270px|The bárányles cross]]
[[File:Baranylestuze.JPG|thumb|right|270px|At the fire, April 24, 2011, 3.00 a.m.]]
The '''bárányles''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] "vigil of the lamb") is a local tradition in the southern Hungarian village [[Hosszúhetény]] and around the [[Zengő]] mountain, a night pilgrimage on [[Easter]] Sunday, in which only males can take part.

The participants set out from the feet of the   [[Zengő]] to reach a cross (Hungarian ''kereszt'') called by locals "the Bocz-kereszt" before dawn. They sit, drink and talk at a fire near the cross until dawn when they surround the cross and briefly pray to welcome the arrival of daylight, or "the Lamb", [[Jesus Christ]].

==Roots==
The explanation to the tradition has several layers.

According to the local tale, an ancestor of a populous local family, the Boczs crossed the [[Mecsek]] mountains more than two hundred years ago, coming from [[Györe]], to visit his love in Hosszúhetény. In a snow storm he lost his way on the mountain. He was near freezing to death when Jesus came in the disguise of a lamb and showed him the way down the mountain, saving his life. In gratitude, the Bocz family erected a cross there and locals visit the place every year to remember the miracle - the tale says.

Recent research found that the cross was erected much later, in 1876, with donation from a miller in [[Püspökszentlászló]] village at the feet of the mountain, who wanted to express his gratitude in this form for the escape of his little daughter from a flash flood.

The cross was renovated in 1918 by a member of the Bocz family and his wife - as an inscription below the cross still shows - to thank God for the safe return of the man from the battles of [[World War I]]. Former local soldiers of the Great War started the tradition of visiting the cross annually. The tradition was kept alive by [[World War II]] survivors and then their descendants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8774">The term '''children's literature criticism''' includes both generalist discussions of the relationship between [[children's literature]] and [[literary theory]] and literary analyses of a specific works of children's literature.  Some academics consider [[young adult literature]] to be included under the rubric of 'children's literature.'

Nearly every school of theoretical thought has been applied to children's literature, most commonly [[Reader-response criticism|reader response]] (Chambers 1980) and [[New Criticism|new criticism]].  However, other schools have been applied in controversial and influential ways, including [[Orientalism]] (Nodelman 1992), [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist theory]] (Paul 1987), [[Postmodern literature|postmodernism]] (Stevenson 1994), [[structuralism]] (Neumeyer 1977), [[post-structuralism]] (Rose, 1984, Lesnik-Oberstein, 1994) and many others.

== Approaches ==

=== Child focused ===
Early children's literature critics aimed to learn how children read literature specifically (rather than the mechanics of reading itself) so that they could recommend "good books" for children. These early critics were often teachers, librarians and other educationalists. The critics often disagreed about what books they think children would like, and why, and about which books will be "good" for children and why. Though many critics are still child-centric, the discipline has expanded to include other modes of analysis.  As children's literature criticism started developing as an academic discipline (roughly in the past thirty years or so, see historical overviews by Hunt (1991) and McGillis (1997)), children's literature criticism became involved with wider work in [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]].

==== Construction of the child ====
Many children's literature critics now point out that children are not one group, but differ according to gender, ethnicity, religious background, and so on. Feminist children's literature critics such as [[Lissa Paul]] (1987) therefore try to work out how boys and girls read differently, for instance. Other critics (for instance, [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]] (1991), [[Perry Nodelman]] (1992), [[John Stephens (literary critic)|John Stephens]] (1992), and [[Roderick McGillis]] (1996)) take this idea a step further and argue that children are often "colonized" by adults, including children's literature critics, because adults speak on behalf of children instead of letting children express themselves. However, these critics too can not agree on what then are "true" children expressing themselves, and which books are therefore "good" for them. Finally, a few critics, notably [[Jacqueline Rose]] (1984) and [[Karin Lesnik-Oberstein]] (1994 and 2004) take this discussion even further, arguing that identities are created and not "inherent", and that in the case of an identity such as "childhood" it is created by "adults" in the light of their own perceptions of themselves. That is, "adulthood" defines "childhood" in relation to differences and similarities it perceives to itself. This [[post-structuralist]] approach is similar to that argued by critics in [[gender studies]] such as [[Judith Butler]] and is widely accepted and used in [[sociological]] and [[anthropological]] studies of [[childhood]] (Jenks 1996; Jenks, James and Prout 1997).

=== Textual focus ===
Many scholars approach children's literature from the perspective of literary studies, examining the text ''as text'' without focus on audience.  Stephens and McCallum (1998) discuss the [[intertextuality]] of children's literature, while Rose explores the identifying characteristics of the [[genre]].  Nodelman (1990) looks at the synthesis of text and illustration in picturebooks.

=== Cultural studies focus ===
Culture studies scholars investigate children's literature as an aspect of culture.  Children's literature, in this light, is a product consumed like other aspects of children's culture: video games, television, and the like.  For more analysis of children's culture in general, see Jenkins.  For literature in particular as cultural artifact, see Mackey.

The '''circuit of culture''' is a theory or framework used in the area of [[cultural studies]]. It was devised in 1997 by a group of theorists when studying the [[Walkman]] cassette player. The theory suggests that in studying a cultural text or artifact you must look at five aspects: its representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation. Du Gay et al. suggest that "taken together (these 5 points) complete a sort of circuit...through which any analysis of a cultural text...must pass if it is to be adequately studied."&lt;ref&gt;du Gay et al. (1997) ''Doing Cultural Studies: The story of the Sony Walkman'' Milton Keynes: Open University; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerard Goggin openly uses this framework in his book ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' in order to fully understand the cell phone as a cultural artifact. His book is split into four parts: production, consumption, regulation, and representation and identity (through looking at mobile convergences).&lt;ref&gt; Goggin, Gerard. (2006) ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural Vistas''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization]] that facilitates internships and professional [[exchange program]]s and services for visitors coming to the U.S., and American students and professionals seeking experiential learning opportunities abroad. The organization is headquartered in [[New York City]], with regional offices located in [[Berlin]], and [[Washington, D.C.]].

Cultural Vistas annually serves nearly 6,000 students, professionals, and emerging leaders through career-focused international internships, educational study tours, language immersion and cultural exchange programs in the United States and around the world.

== Mission ==
To enrich minds, advance global skills, build careers, and connect lives through international exchange.

== Programs ==
Cultural Vistas sponsors and administers a variety of inbound (to the U.S.) and outbound (from the U.S.) exchange programs, experiential learning opportunities, and professional fellowships. The organization is designated by the [[United States Department of State]] as an Exchange Visitor Program sponsor for the Intern, Trainee, and Teacher categories of the [[J-1 visa]]. It also sponsors and facilitates internship placement and [[work abroad]] opportunities for U.S.-based individuals in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[South America]]. In 2014, Cultural Vistas administered professional exchange programs for 5,720 students and young professionals from 136 different countries.

== Organizational history ==
The organization was officially incorporated as a nonprofit in 1963. In January 2011, Cultural Vistas was formed after a nonprofit merger between two longstanding exchange organizations: the Association for International Practical Training (AIPT) and CDS International.

'''AIPT'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 1948, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) President, Dr. [[Karl Compton]], MIT board of trustees, and Earl Eames, a graduating senior in [[chemical engineering]], active in student government, sought ways in which the institute could join the international cooperative undertaking to rebuild war-torn [[Europe]]. As a result of their effort, they formed the U.S. chapter of the newly created [[International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience]] (IAESTE-US). Two years later in 1950, their first [[exchange program]]s occurred when they sent 37 American students to apply their engineering skills in jobs abroad, while American employers welcomed 30 foreign trainees to complete short-term training assignments in the [[United States]]. Students and participating employers soon found the effort extremely valuable in many dimensions: as an excellent tool of public diplomacy, as a new way for forward-thinking corporations to identify talent and form an international workforce. By 1980, the organization grew beyond the technical fields and established professional programs, becoming AIPT.

'''CDS International'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1920s, [[Carl Duisberg]], CEO of [[Bayer AG]] in [[Germany]], initiated the first transatlantic work-study programs between the United States and Germany with the help of the Deutsche Studentenwerke's (German Student Association) New York City office. As hoped, program alumni rose to prominent positions following [[World War II]] at leading firms such as [[AEG]], Bayer, [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[Daimler-Benz]], and [[Siemens]], by introducing in Germany the mass production methods and business practices learned in the United States. The alumni from these initial exchanges founded the Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft (CDG) in 1949 to help engineers, businessmen, and farmers gain international work experience necessary for rebuilding post-war Germany and Europe. In 1968, the Carl Duisberg Society was founded in New York City as a non-profit organization designed to rekindle Duisberg's original exchanges and to facilitate international career training opportunities for Americans and Germans. The name was officially changed to CDS International in 1987 to reflect the organization's increasingly international nature of its programs beyond Germany to include partners in other European countries, [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]].

'''Cultural Competency Training''' is an instruction to achieve cultural competence and the ability to appreciate and interpret accurately other [[culture]]s.

==Cultural competence==
[[Cultural competence]] refers to an ability to interact effectively with people of different cultures. Cultural competence comprises four components: (a) awareness of one's own cultural worldview, (b) attitude towards cultural differences, (c) knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and (d) cross-cultural skills. Developing cultural competence results in an ability to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures and leads to a 15% decrease in miscommunication.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/| title=Cultural Candor Inc. Cultural Competency Training| accessdate=12 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Competency has a fundamental importance in every aspect of a work field and that includes school and government setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasponline.org/research-and-policy/advocacy-tools-and-resources/communications-strategies-and-resources/school-climate%E2%80%94connectthedots/the-importance-of-cultural-competence|title=The Importance of Cultural Competence|website=www.nasponline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the amalgamation of different cultures in American society, it has become imperative for teachers and government employees to have some form of cultural competency training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/39783.htm|title=Why Cultural Competence?|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
To cater to an increasingly globalized society, many hospitals, organizations, and employers may choose to implement forms of cultural competency training methods to enhance transparency between language, values, beliefs, and cultural differences.  Training in cultural competence often includes careful consideration of how best to approach people's various forms of diversity.  This new found awareness oftentimes allows military members, educators, medical practitioners, workers, and common citizens to establish equity in their environments and enhances interrelationships between one another for increased productivity levels.  There have been numerous developed theories as to how best to conduct cultural competency training, which oftentimes is dependent on the specific environment and type of work.

== Cultural Competence Training &amp; Identity ==

When defining the ideas that surround cultural competence training, defining what culture is can help to understand the ideas that shape the concept. [[Culture]] is defined as the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of CULTURE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at culture in terms of cultural competence training, certain groups of individuals should be focused on because of their relevance to society. There are many groups that are marginalized and underrepresented; however, four specific areas to look at are:

=== LGBTQIAP ===
[[LGBT|LGBTQIAP]] community, race, and religion. These areas, along with others, represent concepts that make up one’s identity. The approach to identity helps to shape the ideas and themes that go into cultural competence training.
The acronym LGBTQIAP stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, and Pansexual. This particular group of individuals has faced numerous obstacles and has historical events to highlight the inequalities they face such as the Stonewall riots. The [[Stonewall riots]] became a symbol for the gay liberation movement when police attempted a raid at the Stonewall Inn bar to arrest the gay and lesbian patrons and the gay community fought back. Numerous systemic oppressions historically and currently target LGBT individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyva|first1=Valerie L.|last2=Breshears|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Ringstad|first3=Robin|title=Assessing the Efficacy of LGBT Cultural Competency Training for Aging Services Providers in California’s Central Valley|journal=Journal of Gerontological Social Work|volume=57|issue=2-4|pages=335–348|doi=10.1080/01634372.2013.872215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competence training helps professionals develop knowledge and skills on how to address issues and be more aware on the type of language that is politically correct.

=== Race ===
Race is a sensitive aspect of cultural competency training that requires professionals to be able to identify, acknowledge and value cultural differences. Training on this aspect of cultural competence teaches professionals that to ignore racial differences, is a form of microaggression that can help exacerbate racial inequalities.  In order to begin to understand intercultural communications one must understand the historical and social context under which different cultural groups operate.  For example, the history related to the cultural genocide of indigenous peoples in North America, understanding the said group’s value system, their ways of learning, and logic is essential in being able to understand how certain aspects of their culture may be similar or different from our own. Such distinction must be approached with respect and without ascribing superiority or inferiority to the difference.

=== Religion ===
Religious differences can play a role in how professionals interact and communicate with others. [[Religiosity]] refers to the nature and extent of public and private religious activity, including belief in God, prayer, and place of worship attendance. Religiosity is usually linked to formal religious traditions (such as [[Christianity]]), institutions (such as mosques), sacred texts (such as [[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]]), and a definitive moral code (such as the Decalogue). Spirituality can be an important part of religion but can also exist independent of extant faith traditions, involving a variety of more individual subjective beliefs and activities related to the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect of cultural competence training professionals should learn how to have religious competence. Religious competence refers to skills, practices, and orientations that recognize, explore, and harness patient religiosity to facilitate diagnosis, recovery, and healing. Religious competence involves the learning and deployment of generic competencies, including active listening and a nonjudgmental stance. It is also an overarching orientation, providing a safe place for discussion of religious issues and identities received in a humble, respectful, and empathetic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=Rob|last2=Jarvis|first2=Eric G.|title=Religious Understanding as Cultural Competence: Issues for Clinicians|journal=Psychiatric Times|date=June 2015|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationality ===
in terms of nationality, particularly for people who are immigrants, the recent increase in global migration make them an increasingly common demographic everywhere. Though they will have varying cultures as well. In this aspect, it is important for those who are trained to understand both similarities and differences between them, and the individual they are helping. With this knowledge, it makes the process of aiding the individual more efficient, and successful. &lt;ref&gt;Schouler-Ocak, Graef-Calliess, Tarricone, Qureshi, Kastrup, &amp; Bhugra. (2015). EPA guidance on cultural competence training. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''30''(3), 431-440.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the past Nation the individual has come from, and their journey of immigration as an experience, can shape their mentality. To have specialists with specific nationalities help explain some differences is a helpful strategy. &lt;ref&gt;Bhugra, D. (2017). Cultural competence training and mental health care in refugees and asylum seekers. ''European Psychiatry,'' ''41''(SS), S35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in School ==
School is considered to be the second learning home for kids. Every year a large number of people come to the United States. These groups of people are often families, including small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics|title=Immigration Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today’s world, cultural competency plays a very vital role in shaping the kids future. In the United States, there is an underlying difference among parents as to how a kid should be raised, but it is clear that cultural competency should be taught at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fee.org/articles/cultural-competence-and-your-child/|title=Cultural Competence and Your Child {{!}} Wendy McElroy|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|date=2007-09-01|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is not the front runner in cultural competency training amongst children, as Canada and Australia are seemingly far more progressive in this sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wehearyou.acecqa.gov.au/2014/07/10/what-does-it-mean-to-be-culturally-competent/|title=What does it mean to be culturally competent?|last=ACECQA|first=Author|date=2014-07-10|website=We Hear You|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural competency training can be a huge help for the families who are thinking of adopting a foster child, specifically, if that child was born outside of United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/pressroom/features/issue/diversity.asp|title=Diversity &amp; Cultural Competence|website=www.socialworkers.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school is a mixture of different races and cultures and as an educator, one must be sensitive to everyone’s needs. Different cultures act uniquely to the different situations, and as an educator, one has to not only value diversity, but also have a strategy for everyone to feel welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/30402.htm|title=Diversity Toolkit: Cultural Competence for Educators|work=NEA|access-date=2017-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Competence Training in the Workforce ==
Over the years, there have been new developed ways of practicing cultural competency in the workforce. There are many different methods that would allow assistance in cultural competency such as: Global leadership programs, international team building exercises and specific cross-cultural skills training for special executive positions. Having a good grasp on the many different cultures that exist is increasingly becoming a major principle in the workforce. The techniques for cultural competency training must be practiced more than just in class room lecture. Trainers must be extremely educated in this matter to be able to sufficiently train people.  They must take notice of their own biases perspective and about the different types cultures that receive discrimination.

In the medical setting, effective communication between clinicians, patients, families and other health care providers is fundamental.

[[Health disparities]] refer to gaps in the quality of health and health care across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Studies have demonstrated the multiple factors that contribute to health disparities.

Cultural Competence Online for Medical Practice (CCOMP) is an attempt in the United States to address one of the factors - the patient-doctor interaction.  The CCOMP project is funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  CCOMP offers a clinician's guide to reduce cardiovascular disparities, intended to create effective cross-cultural approaches to care for African-American patients with [[cardiovascular disease]], especially [[hypertension]]. Videos with real patient scenarios and case-based modules are aimed at developing this increased awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">The '''cultural mulatto''' is a concept introduced by [[Trey Ellis]] in his 1989 essay, ''The New Black Aesthetic''. While the term "[[mulatto]]" typically refers to a person of mixed black and white ancestry, a cultural mulatto is defined by Ellis as a black person who is highly educated and usually a part of the middle or [[Upper middle class|upper-middle class]], and therefore [[Cultural assimilation|assimilates]] easily into traditionally white environments. 

== Overview ==
Ellis writes, "Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world" (235).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/whos-afraid-of-me_b_981005.html|title = The New Black Aesthetic Revisited|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural mulattoes are skillful code-switchers and they may be equally comfortable around blacks as around whites. Members of the New Black Aesthetic are typically cultural mulattoes. Their ability for easy interaction with both blacks and whites is what ultimately allows cultural mulattoes opportunities for class and status [[Social mobility|upward mobility]].

== Examples ==
Examples of cultural mulattoes offered by Ellis include:
* [[Bill Cosby]]'s daughters&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/obama-cultural-mulatto_b_41576.html|title = Obama: Cultural Mulatto|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absinthe has played a notable role in the [[fine art]] movements of [[Impressionism]], [[Post-impressionism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Modernism]], [[Cubism]] and in the corresponding literary movements. The legendary drink has more recently appeared in movies, video, television, music, and contemporary literature. The modern absinthe revival has had a notable effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid demonstrating the influence of contemporary marketing efforts.

Absinthe has a widely documented role in 19th-century visual art and was frequently the subject of many [[Genre works|genre paintings]] and [[still life]]s of the day.

*[[Edgar Degas]]' painting ''[[L'Absinthe]]'' (1876) portrayed grim absinthe drinkers in a cafe. Degas himself never called the painting "L'Absinthe"; it was either his art dealer or a later owner who gave it the name.  Years later, it set off a flurry in the London art world, and the grim realism of "L'Absinthe" (a theme popular with [[bohemian]] artists) was perceived by London art critics as a lesson against alcohol and the French in general. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
*[[Paul Gauguin]] is known for consuming large quantities of absinthe,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and his bold use of flat color has also been attributed to its influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/352/12/1275 NEJM - Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=November 2009}}

*[[Picasso]] depicted absinthe in various media, including the paintings ''Woman Drinking Absinthe'' (1901), ''Bottle of Pernod and Glass'' (1912), and the sculpture ''Absinthe Glass'' (1914).
*[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] was notorious for his consumption of the green muse. He often painted impressionistic scenes of the brothels and night spots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coloradocollege.edu/publications/thebulletin/spring97/gayle.html |title=Gale Murray and Toulouse-Lautrec |work=Coloradocollege.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529160958/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/Publications/thebulletin/spring97/gayle.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 19th-century [[Montmartre]]. Lautrec was even known to carry a hollow cane filled with absinthe during long nights out in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdmart.org/lautrec/food_bib.html Toulouse-Lautrec: Bibliographies - Food, Drink, Recipes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328084241/http://www.sdmart.org/lautrec/food_bib.html |date=March 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of Lautrec's work featuring absinthe is in the painting ''Monsieur Boileau au café''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
*[[Vincent van Gogh]] was not a man of moderation, and drank large quantities of absinthe&lt;ref&gt;Naralie Amgier, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C0CE7DC153AF932A2575AC0A966958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fM%2fMonet%2c%20Claude Studying Art With the Eye Of a Physician], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 11, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; while creating his signature painting style.

==Literature==

===Classic literature===
As prominent as absinthe's influence on visual art was, it is perhaps even more noteworthy in the context of 19th-century literature. Below is a short list of important authors who credited a portion of their literary success to the drink.

*[[Baudelaire]] was an avid absinthe drinker. Though he never wrote specifically about absinthe he did reference it in his famous poem "Get Drunk".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.absintheliquor.com/famous_absinthe_citats.htm Absintheliquor.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Guy de Maupassant]] was a naturalistic French author. He is generally considered one of the greatest French short story writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online-literature.com/maupassant/ |title=Guy de Maupassant - Biography and Works |work=Online-literature.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one famous work of prose, "A Queer Night in Paris", he describes the smells and sensations of absinthe in the streets of Paris and makes an overt reference to "the hour to take absinthe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readprint.com/work-1178/Guy-de-Maupassant |title=A Queer Night in Paris by Guy de Maupassant |publisher=Read Print |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ernest Dowson]] was an important English poet who notably wrote a poem dedicated to absinthe called "Absinthia Taetra".
*[[Ernest Hemingway]] features absinthe in the [[short story]] "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" (1927), and in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940), disappointed with the quality of other liquor available, Robert Jordan turns to absinthe while fighting with the loyalist guerrillas. Hemingway himself was a frequent absinthe drinker and most likely procured his absinthe from Spain and [[Cuba]] after the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barnaby Conrad III|Conrad III, Barnaby]]; (1988). ''Absinthe History in a Bottle. ''Chronicle books. {{ISBN|0-8118-1650-8}} p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alfred Jarry]] is notably the author of the French absurdist play, ''Ubu Roi.'' Jarry claimed to use absinthe to "fuse together the dream and reality, art and lifestyle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The drink was purported by the author to be a key part of his creative process.
*[[Arthur Rimbaud]] was a young Parisian poet who was notably involved in a homosexual relationship with Paul Verlaine; they famously drank large quantities of absinthe together. Their relationship ended when Rimbaud was shot in the hand by Verlaine, who was then sentenced to prison. Later in life Rimbaud quit drinking absinthe and writing poetry and instead became involved in military exploits and [[gun running]]. He is still regarded as one of France's greatest poets.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*[[Paul Marie Verlaine]] was a famous Parisian poet of the Bohemian style. Though he wrote extensively about the benefits of absinthe in his early years, he later claimed to have consorted with prostitutes and men while drinking it, and blamed the beverage for his downfalls. Even when he was on his deathbed, his friends were said to be hiding bottles for him under his pillow.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zoomgraphics.com/absinthe/drinkers.html |title=Zoomgraphics Absinthe Page |work=Zoomgraphics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606074910/http://www.zoomgraphics.com/absinthe/drinkers.html |archivedate=2010-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Oscar Wilde]] was an avid absinthe consumer {{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and often wrote about the drink in connection with the creative process.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Wilde has been quoted as saying, "What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html |title=Oxygénée's Absinthe FAQ IV |work=Oxygenee.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926210034/http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Absinthe History in a bottle" [[Barnaby Conrad III]] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; and "After the first glass [of absinthe] you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally, you see things as they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michelleblack.com/books/absinthe.html |title=The Second Glass of Absinthe |publisher=Michelle Black |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary literature ===

*[[Dennis Wheatley]] included an absinthe session in his novel about the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]] in 1914, ''The Second Seal'' (1950). Wheatley was a wine merchant for many years, with a wide stock of spirits and liqueurs as well, and always put much information on the subject in his books. His hero the [[Duke de Richleau]] has been sent by British Intelligence on a mission to Vienna. He has to foil a plot by the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] to disturb the peace of Europe, and so of course must concentrate his thoughts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;  Instinctively he walked back across the Ring to Sachers. There he went up to his room, sat on his bed for a while, then rang for the waiter and ordered a double Absinthe. When it arrived, he added sugar and water and slowly drank the opal fluid. It had no more perceptible kick in it than lime juice, or a diluted [[paregoric]] cough mixture which it resembled in flavour, but he knew it had hidden properties which would act like a drug in clearing and accelerating his brain.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

*An absinthe hallucination may or may not have inspired a murder in ''The Second Glass of Absinthe'' (2003), a mystery novel by [[Michelle Black]], set in 1880 Leadville, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Michelle, ''The Second Glass of Absinthe. ''Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-7653-4756-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Asinthe lends the name to [[Kyell Gold]]'s novel ''Green Fairy''. The substance is the driving force in [[Forester Universe#Dangerous Spirits|Dangerous Spirits]], in which multiple protagonists make use of it to commune with spirits.
*Gemma Doyle, the main character of Libba Bray's 2007 sequel ''[[Rebel Angels (Bray novel)|Rebel Angels]]'' (set in 1895), drinks absinthe with her friends at a Christmas ball and experiences hallucinatory effects.
*The characters in [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s short story, "His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood", discover a crate of absinthe, the consumption of which forms the backdrop against which their transgressive antics occur.  The short story can be found in ''[[Swamp Foetus]]''. Characters in her book ''[[Lost Souls (Poppy Z. Brite novel)|Lost Souls]]'' also drink absinthe.&lt;ref name="LadouceurPullin2011"/&gt;
*''The Absinthe Cloud'' (LePage/Dupuy #1, 2012) is a spy thriller by Timothy Everhart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Everhard|title=The Absinthe Cloud (LePage/Dupuy #1)|id=[[Barnes &amp; Noble|BNID]] [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=2940044758377 2940044758377]|publisher=[[Smashwords]]|date=2012-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Absinthe figures heavily into the plot of the novel ''[[The Basic Eight]]'' (1999), by [[Daniel Handler]], which features Bohemian characters who are drawn to absinthe by its dangerous history.&lt;ref&gt;Handler, Daniel; (1999). ''The Basic Eight''. Thomas Dunne Books. {{ISBN|0-312-19833-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell]]'' (2006) contains a story in which the author, [[Tucker Max]], experiences absinthe for the first time.
*The [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]] character [[Aloysius Pendergast]] displays an affinity for absinthe in multiple novels.

==Music==
* [[Barbara (singer)|Barbara]] (1930-1997) the popular French female singer wrote and composed, with Frédéric Botton, and sang "l Absinthe", a song published in her 12th album [[:fr:La Fleur d'amour|''La Fleur d'amour'']] (1972). This song is a love song, a bit sad and nostalgic -sadness is Barbara's trademark-, where the singer explains to a lover that drinking absinthe helps, at last to feel in love, to render love joyful, just like it helped Rimbaud and Verlaine to write their poetry (a recurrent comparison, all along the song).
*[[Marilyn Manson]] has been an avid fan of absinthe since the recording of the ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1174198.html "Go green with Marilyn: Drowned In Sound - Thurs 28 Sep 2006 absinthe news article"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">The '''Effective Group Decision-Making Theory''' is one of several theories of [[intercultural communication]].&lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, William B. (2003), "Intercultural Communication Theories", in: Gudykunst, William B (ed.), Cross-Cultural and Intercultural Communication, 167-189, Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision-making==
Developed in the 1990s by John G. Oetzel it focuses on decision-making within groups integrating also the [[Participative decision-making#Vigilant interaction theory|Vigilant Interaction Theory]] (Hirokawa and Rost) as well as the [[Face Negotiation Theory]] by Ting-Toomey. It takes the influence of culture on group processes as a basis and it depends on social interactions among group members.The purpose of this study which is to determine whether relationship between  group interaction quality and group decision performance can be generalized to established organizational groups.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Hirokawa; Kathryn Rost,"Effective Group Decision Making in Organizations: Field Test of the Vigilant Interaction Theory", February 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the theory presents different group constellations and their way of making decisions. Emphasizing the possible success Oetzels theory belongs to the theories focusing on effective outcomes.
Oetzel states that groups making decisions can be homogeneous, i.e. monocultural or heterogeneous, i.e. multicultural. Within multicultural groups, there exist different decision-making strategies with the individuals due to the diverse cultural backgrounds. These different strategies may lead to conflicts in the process. The diverse backgrounds of the individuals will also result in different strategies for dealing with those conflicts. The effectiveness of a decision is dependent on its quality and appropriateness.

[[Participative decision-making#Vigilant interaction theory|Vigilant Interaction Theory]] describes the group decision-making process as a series of interrelated sub-decisions leading to the final decision. According to the theory the quality of the final decision is based on 1)analysis of the problem/ situation 2) establishment of goals and objectives 3)evaluation of positive and negative qualities of the available choices.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Hirokawa, ["Effective Group Decision Making in Organizations Field Test of Vigilant Interaction Theory"], ''Management Communication Quarterly'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This theory shows that group decision performance is largely depended on the wise group decision-makings from social interactions.

==Propositions==

===1 thru 7===
The theory contains 14 propositions&lt;ref&gt;Oetzel, John G. (1995), "Intercultural small groups: An effective decision-making theory", in Wiseman, Richard L (ed.), Intercultural communication theory, 247-270, Thousands Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; as a core. Of those, the first half focuses on the influence of input on the process of decision-making. Here Oetzel assumes that individual members of homogeneous groups activate either independent self-construals (such members emphasize the quality decision and are not primarily interested in relationships among members) or interdependent self construals (those members are concerned for cooperation and others; the decision is secondary). Therefore homogeneous groups consisting of members that activate independent will take longer to reach a decision. The process is less cooperative and will have more conflicts than with homogeneous groups whose members activate interdependent self-construals. In addition to that, heterogeneous groups will less likely reach consensus than homogeneous groups since with homogeneous groups the single members are more committed to their group and that their contributions are treated more equally than in heterogeneous groups. Furthermore Oetzel claims that groups were the majority of members activate independent self-construals will most likely use dominating conflict-strategies, whereas with groups were most members use interdependent self-construals will use strategies of avoiding, compromising or obliging when dealing with conflicts.

===8 to 14===
Propositions 8 to 14 focus on the influence of the process on the outcome, i.e. on the decision. Those groups that use cooperative styles of conflict-management such as compromising make more effective decisions than those who use avoiding or competing styles as they put the group before the personal goals and have more creative solutions. Decisions will also be more effective in groups were members activate their personal identities. In groups were members activate social identities decisions will less effective since the different ideas of members are not used to their full extent and participation is unequal. This leads to the assumption that the more equal members in their groups are and the more committed individuals are to their group and to the decision the more effective the outcome will be. Therefore decisions reached by consensus are more effective than those made by majority for example. Finally the VIT’s “functional requisites” can predict the quality of decisions in mono- and multicultural groups. Those groups who meet these requisites will make decisions of higher quality.

However, not all propositions have been evaluated yet and Oetzel does not consider his theory finished.

'''Ethnology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἔθνος'', ''ethnos'' meaning "nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ethno-|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethno-?q=ethno|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the branch of [[anthropology]] that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different [[peoples]] and the relationships between them (cf. [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[social anthropology|social]], or [[sociocultural anthropology]]).&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=ethnology|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethnology?q=ethnology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific discipline==
{{further information|Ethnicity}}
Compared to [[ethnography]], the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.

[[File:AFKollar 1779.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Adam František Kollár]], 1779]]
The term ''ethnologia'' (''ethnology'') is credited to [[Adam František Kollár|Adam Franz Kollár]] (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his ''Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates'' published in [[Vienna]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Zmago Šmitek and Božidar Jezernik, "The anthropological tradition in Slovenia." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. ''Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; as: “the science of nations and peoples, or, that study of learned men in which they inquire into the origins, languages, customs, and institutions of various nations, and finally into the fatherland and ancient seats, in order to be able better to judge the nations and peoples in their own times.” &lt;ref&gt;Kollár, Adam František  − Historiae jurisque publici regni Ungariae amoenitates, I-II. Vienna., 1783&lt;/ref&gt;

Kollár's interest in linguistic and cultural diversity was aroused by the situation in his native multi-ethnic and multilingual [[History of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary]] and his roots among its [[Slovak people|Slovaks]], and by the shifts that began to emerge after the gradual retreat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the more distant [[Balkans#Population composition by nationality and religion|Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghiţă Geană, "Discovering the whole of humankind: the genesis of anthropology through the Hegelian looking-glass." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of [[human history]], and the formulation of [[culture|cultural]] [[universal (metaphysics)|invariants]], such as the [[incest taboo]] and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about "[[human nature]]", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]], [[structuralism]], etc.). In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] doctrine, with ''[[cultural anthropology]]'' becoming dominant especially in the [[United States]], and ''[[social anthropology]]'' in [[Great Britain]].  The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.

[[File:Levi-strauss_260.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]]]
The 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the [[Western world]]), such as the notion of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]".  This term was used in conjunction with "savages", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the "[[noble savage]]". Thus, [[civilization]] was opposed in a dualist manner to [[barbary]], a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared [[ethnocentrism]]. The progress of ethnology, for example with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structural anthropology]], led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear [[progress (history)|progress]], or the pseudo-opposition between "societies with histories" and "societies without histories", judged too dependent on a limited view of [[history]] as constituted by accumulative growth.

Lévi-Strauss often referred to [[Montaigne]]'s [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] on [[cannibalism]] as an early example of ethnology. Lévi-Strauss aimed, through a [[structuralism|structural method]], at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the [[incest taboo]]. However, the claims of such cultural [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Derrida]], [[Althusser]], and [[Deleuze]].

The French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included Lévi-Strauss, [[Paul Rivet]], [[Marcel Griaule]], [[Germaine Dieterlen]], and [[Jean Rouch]].

'''Exercise bulimia''' is a subset of the [[psychological disorder]] called [[bulimia]] in which a person is compelled to exercise in an effort aimed at burning the [[calories]] of [[food energy]] and [[body fat|fat reserves]] to an excessive level that negatively affects their [[health]]. The damage normally occurs through not giving the body adequate [[Human relaxation|rest]] for athletic recovery compared to their exercise levels, leading to increasing levels of disrepair. If the person eats a normally healthy and adequate diet but exercises in levels they know require higher levels of nutrition, this can also be seen as a form of [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]].

[[File:Hamilton Men I Have Painted 007.jpg|thumb|The foreword to ''Men I Have Painted'', by John McLure Hamilton; 1921]]
[[File:Der Haussekretär Hrsg Carl Otto Berlin ca 1900 F Titelseiten 3 Vorwort1.jpg|thumb|Foreword, to a 1900 book in German]]
A '''foreword''' is a (usually short) piece of writing sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of [[literature]].  Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book's primary author or the story the book tells.  Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.

When written by the author, the foreword may cover the story of how the book came into being or how the idea for the book was developed, and may include thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pope| first = Geoff| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "Foreword" Versus "Forward" | work = Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips| publisher = Macmillan Holdings, LLC| date = 18 November 2010| url = http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/forward-versus-foreword.aspx| format = | doi = | accessdate = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a [[preface]], a foreword is always signed.

Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an [[introduction (essay)|introduction]], rather than in the foreword or preface.

The pages containing the foreword and preface (and other front matter) are typically not numbered as part of the main work, which usually uses [[Arabic numerals]].  If the front matter is paginated, it uses lowercase [[Roman numerals]].  If there is both a foreword and a preface, the foreword appears first; both appear before the introduction, which may be paginated either with the front matter or the main text.

The word ''foreword'' was first used around the mid-17th century, originally as a term in [[philology]]. It was possibly a [[calque]] of [[German (language)|German]] ''Vorwort'', itself a calque of Latin ''praefatio''.

The '''G.I. Generation''' (also known as the '''WWII Generation''' or '''[[The Greatest Generation]]''' in the United States or the '''Federation Generation''' in [[Australia]]) is the demographic cohort following the [[Lost Generation]]. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1900s as starting birth years and ending birth years in the mid-1920s.

==Definition==
This generation experienced much of their youth during rapid [[technological innovation]] (radio, telephone) amidst growing levels of worldwide [[income inequality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2012.pdf |title=Striking it Richer |website=eml.berkeley.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/05/u-s-income-inequality-on-rise-for-decades-is-now-highest-since-1928/|title=U.S. income inequality, on rise for decades, is now highest since 1928|date=5 December 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/07/5-facts-about-economic-inequality/|title=5 facts about economic inequality|date=7 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a soaring economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/41/17290|title=Life and death during the Great Depression|first1=José A.

Demographers [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Stauss and Neil Howe]] coined the term "G.I. Generation" in their 1991 book ''Generations: The History of America's Future''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FTGY-uoCCCoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=generations#v=onepage&amp;q=generations&amp;f=false |title=Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 |first=William|last=Strauss|first2=Neil|last2=Howe|publisher=Harper Perennial |year=1991|isbn=9780688119126 }} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; and use 1901–1924 as birth years.&lt;ref name = "Howe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=The G.I. Generation and the "Triumph of the Squares"|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2014/07/30/the-g-i-generation-and-the-triumph-of-the-squares-part-2-of-7/#14f6fc301a1d|accessdate=26 November 2016|publisher=Forbes|date=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initials [[G.I. (military)|"G.I."]] of "G.I. Generation" is military terminology referring to "Government Issue" or "General Issue". This cohort is also referred to as the "World War II Generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Greatest Generation|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/the_greatest_generation.asp|accessdate=26 November 2016|publisher=Investopia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCrindle Research expanded on Howe's work and uses the term ''Federation Generation'' to describe [[Australians|Australian]] members of this cohort, born between 1901–1924, "a time of peace when Australia finally secured nationhood" who came of age during The [[Great Depression]] and WWII and experienced post-war prosperity in midlife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined]. Mark McCrindle {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616232732/http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf |date=2016-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCrindle|first1=Mark|title=The ABC of XYZ Understanding the Global Generations|url=http://www.saspa.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-ABC-of-XYZ_Chapter-1.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2018|publisher=McCrindle Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pew Research Center]] defines this cohort as being born from 1901 to 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2016/12/15/americans-name-the-10-most-significant-historic-events-of-their-lifetimes/|title=Americans Name the 10 Most Significant Historic Events of Their Lifetimes|date=15 December 2016|publisher=People Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[The Greatest Generation]]'', which is a term sometimes used to refer to the US members of this cohort, comes from the title of 1998 book by American journalist [[Tom Brokaw]]. In the book, Brokaw profiled American members of this generation who came of age during the Great Depression and went on to fight in [[World War II]], as well as those who contributed to the war effort on the home front. Brokaw wrote that these men and women fought not for fame or recognition, but because it was the "right thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rQagD17IFS4C&amp;q=the+greatest+generation&amp;dq=the+greatest+generation&amp;cd=1 |title=The greatest generation - Tom Brokaw - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16|isbn=9780375502026 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable members==
Sample members include [[Walt Disney]], [[Charles Lindberg]], [[John Steinbeck]]. Notable actors [[Bob Hope]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[John Wayne]]. U.S. presidents were [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].

'''Habis''' (from the [[Cynete]] language meaning [[fawn]]) is a legendary king of the Spanish region of [[Tartessos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hérnuñez|first1=Pollux|title=Mitos, héroes y monstruos de la España antigua|publisher=Amaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to legend, Habis's story began when his mother was stung by a bee. Her father, the king of Tartessos, hurried to heal her. As he knelt to soften her wound with his mouth, a passion came over both, thus procreating the baby. Due to the shame of having committed [[incest]], the king ordered the child to be abandoned on the prairies outside the kingdom. Eventually the boy was raised by the deer in there, acquiring deer features. He was later found and recognized as the true heir to the kingdom, and later accordingly named.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elfarodemalaga.es/index.php?id=portada&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Table''' is a table for the use of [[fellow]]s (members of the [[Senior Common Room]]) and their guests at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] and [[Durham University|Durham]] colleges. Other academic institutions (such as [[University of London]]; [[University of St Andrews]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/accommodation/ug/residences/stsalvators/ St Salvator's Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Manchester]] and [[University of Bristol]] in the UK, [[Queen's University]], and [[The University of Trinity College]] and [[Massey College]] at the [[University of Toronto]], and the [[University of Hong Kong]]) also have high tables.
The table is normally at the end of the dining hall on a raised platform, although this is not always the case. On more formal evening occasions, [[dinner jacket]]s are worn. It is also normal to wear [[academic dress|academic gowns]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8312">The '''history of mentalities''' is a [[calque]] of the [[French language|French]] term ''histoire des mentalités'', which might also be translated as "[[history]] of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s", "[[mindset]]s" or "[[world-view]]s". The term describes a particular manner of researching history. This approach is associated with the "critical turn" (''tournant critique'') taken by the historians of the [[Annales School|''Annales'' School]], particularly around the 1960s.

In keeping with the ''Annales''' interest in the ''[[longue durée]]'' (long-term), the history of mentalities focuses on the mindsets of past cultural and social groups, and their gradual changes over time, as opposed to the history of particular events, or economic trends. The term can also be seen as an equivalent to, or a form of, [[cultural history]] or [[historical anthropology]]

== History ==

=== ''Annales'' ===
The history of mentalities, or ''histoire des mentalités'', is a term used to describe works of history aimed at describing and analyzing the ways in which people of a given time period thought about, interacted with, and classified the world around them. The history of mentalities has been used as a historical tool by several historians and scholars from various schools of history. Notably, the historians of the [[Annales School|''Annales'' School]] helped to develop the history of mentalities and construct a methodology from which to operate. In establishing this methodology, they sought to limit their analysis to a particular place and a particular time.&lt;ref name=Duby&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duby|first1=Georges|title=The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined|date=1980|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} This approach lends itself to the intensive study that characterizes microhistory, another field which adopted the history of mentalities as a tool of historical analysis.

The origin of the term history of mentalities lies in the writings of the ''Annales'' historians such as [[Georges Duby]] and [[Roger Chartier]]. In seeking to create works of total history, ''Annales'' historians tended not to simply rely on the political or event oriented history of past generations.&lt;ref name=Harsgor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harsgor|first1=Michael|title=Total History: The Annales School|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|date=January 1978|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Michael Harsgor points out in that the challenge of the ''Annales'' historians was not to create this deterministic history that appeared to rely heavily on teleological conclusions, such as the Marxist forms of history being written at the time. Rather, Harsgor writes that the ''Annales'' historians tasked themselves with the creation of social structures, "which means covering the skeleton of the basic economic analysis with the flesh of demographic, cultural, mental, and event psychoanalytical data."&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|4}} It has also been said that ''Annales'' historians, in their attempts at the creation of total history, considered the history of mentalities a single aspect in the creation of that history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutton|first1=Patrick|title=The History of Mentalities: The New Map of Cultural History|journal=History and Theory|date=October 1981|volume=20|issue=3|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply put, they were attempting to reconstruct the world of whatever time period they were examining. In his works, such as ''The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined'' and his work on William Marshal, Duby focused on the development of ideologies within the structures that permeated the various aspects of an individual's life.&lt;ref name=Duby/&gt;{{rp|9}}

=== Microhistory ===
This development in methodology would prove crucial for other historians who would use the history of mentalities to attempt to reconstruct the worldviews of individuals and extrapolate their findings to the population at large in the form of microhistories. These historians would largely concern themselves with social and cultural history in order to form their history of mentalities, narrowing their realm historical inquiry by not concerning themselves with the broad economic serialization that had become so important for the ''Annales'' historians.&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|2}} [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s book, ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]'', is archetypical of the microhistories that emerged with the history of mentalities in mind. Ginzburg attempted to reconstruct peasant mentalities in sixteenth century Italy by examining the trial records of a single miller, Domenico Scandella, called [[Menocchio]], and trying to find currents or similarities in otherwise fragmentary and obscure evidence.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginzburg|first1=Carlo|title=The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller|date=2013|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}}

Similar techniques can be seen in [[Robert Darnton]]'s ''[[The Great Cat Massacre]]'', which uses microhistory to establish the mentalities of groups at different social levels of French society. Darnton concerns himself greatly with the ways in which people viewed the world around them. He interprets the symbolic significance of journeymen printers massacring neighborhood cats as a display of frustration with the growing bourgeoisie class.&lt;ref name=Darnton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darnton|first1=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|date=1984|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} Similarly, and in keeping with the tradition of the history of mentalities, Darnton devotes a chapter to an analysis of a bourgeoisie's description of his city, in an effort to determine how an individual in a given social situation would interpret and make sense of the world around them. Darnton uses this description to demonstrate that the ways in which events might be portrayed might be completely unsupported by the ways in which individuals of the time might have interpreted those events.&lt;ref name=Darnton/&gt;{{rp|116}}

== Criticism ==
Criticisms have emerged regarding the history of mentalities at all stages of its development. In particular, [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] were quick to criticize the ''Annales'' historians for "attempts to include the study of mentalities in a general synthesis, which can only lead to the publication of articles reflecting a basic reliance upon faith accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason."&lt;ref name=Harsgor/&gt;{{rp|7}} Carlo Ginzburg himself has criticized the methods of the history of mentalities for its "decidedly classless character."&lt;ref name=Ginzburg/&gt;{{rp|xxx}}

'''Interbellum Generation''' is a term (derived from the [[Latin]] ''inter'' "between" and ''bellum'' "war") that is sometimes used to denote persons born in the [[United States]] during the first decade of the 20th century, often expressed specifically as the years 1901 to 1913.  The name comes from the fact that those born during this time were too young to have served in the military during [[World War I]], and were generally too old to serve as enlisted personnel in [[World War II]], although many of them could indeed be found in the armed forces in some capacity during the later conflict.

Members of this generation came of age either during the [[Roaring Twenties]] or the initial phase of the [[Great Depression]], prior to the election of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the promulgation of the [[New Deal]].  This fact contributed to the core of this generation holding lifelong [[left wing|left]]-[[Liberalism|liberal]] views in politics, especially on economic issues, although a few prominent  dissenters (such as [[Barry Goldwater]]) do stand out.  Most of their children belong to the [[Silent Generation]].

The four [[Presidents of the United States]] of the Interbellum Generation were [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (born in 1908), [[Ronald Reagan]] (born in 1911) and [[Richard M. Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]] (both born in 1913). (However, Reagan, Nixon and Ford served in World War II with members of the [[G.I. generation|Greatest Generation]].)

Living members of this generation include [[Richard Arvine Overton]], the oldest living World War II veteran. For deceased celebrities born in this era, see [[G.I. Generation]].

{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}

An '''invocation''' (from the [[Latin verbs|Latin verb]] ''invocare'' "to call on, invoke, to give") may take the form of:
[[File:Gustave dore crusades invocation to muhammad.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Invocation'' by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

*[[Supplication]], [[prayer]] or [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]].
*A form of [[Spirit possession|possession]].
*[[wikt:command|Command]] or [[conjuration]].
*[[Self-identification]] with certain spirits.

These forms are described below, but are not mutually exclusive. 
See also [[Theurgy]].

== Supplication or prayer ==
As a supplication or prayer it implies to call upon [[God]], a god, [[goddess]], or person, etc. When a person calls upon God, a god, or goddess to ask for something (protection, a favour, his/her spiritual presence in a ceremony, etc.) or simply for [[worship]], this can be done in a pre-established form or with the invoker's own words or actions. An example of a pre-established text for an invocation is the [[Lord's Prayer]].

All religions in general use invoking prayers, [[liturgies]], or [[hymns]]; see for example the [[mantra]]s in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], the [[Egypt]]ian ''Coming Out by Day'' (aka ''[[Book of the Dead]]''), the [[Orphic]] Hymns and the many texts, still preserved, written in [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] characters on clay tablets, addressed to [[Shamash]], [[Ishtar]], and other deities.

=== As alternative to prayer ===
An invocation can also be a secular alternative to a prayer. On August 30, 2012, Dan Nerren, a member of the Humanist Association of Tulsa, delivered a secular invocation to open a meeting of the City Council of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newson6.com/global/story.asp?s=19423373|title = Atheist Delivers Invocation At Tulsa City Council Meeting For First Time Ever|date = Aug 30, 2012&lt;!-- 9:27 PM EDT--&gt;|publisher = KOTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nerren was invited to perform the invocation as a compromise following a long-running dispute with the City Council over prayers opening meetings. The invocation was written by Andrew Lovley, a member of the Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists who had previously used the invocation in 2009 to invoke an inauguration ceremony for new city officials in [[South Portland, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.secularstudents.org/node/2938|title = Andrew Lovley's Secular Invocation|publisher = Secular Students Alliance|date = 2009-12-15 &lt;!-- - 10:08 --&gt; |author = Lyz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this usage, it is comparable to an [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] as an alternative for those who conscientiously object to taking [[oath]]s of any kind, be it for reasons of belief or [[non-belief]].

== A form of possession ==
The word "possession" is used here in its neutral form to mean "a state (sometimes psychological) in which an individual's normal personality is replaced by another". This is also sometimes known as 'aspecting'.  This can be done as a means of communicating with or getting closer to a deity or spirit, and as such need not be viewed synonymously with [[demonic possession]].

In some religious traditions including [[Paganism]], [[Shamanism]] and [[Wicca]], "invocation" means to draw a spirit or Spirit force into one's own body and is differentiated from "[[evocation]]", which involves asking a spirit or force to become present at a given location. Again, [[Aleister Crowley]] states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To "invoke" is to "call in", just as to "evoke" is to "call forth". This is the essential difference between the two branches of [[Magic (paranormal)|Magick]]. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the [[consciousness]]. In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates a microcosm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]], ''Magick, Book 4'', p.147&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Possessive invocation may be attempted singly or, as is often the case in Wicca, in pairs - with one person doing the invocation (reciting the liturgy or prayers and acting as anchor), and the other person being invoked (allowing themselves to become a vessel for the spirit or deity). The person successfully invoked may be moved to speak or act in non-characteristic ways, acting as the deity or spirit; and they may lose all or some self-awareness while doing so. A communication might also be given via imagery (a [[religious vision]]). They may also be led to recite a text in the manner of that deity, in which case the invocation is more akin to ritual drama. The Wiccan [[Charge of the Goddess]] is an example of such a pre-established recitation. See also the [[ritual]] of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]].

The ecstatic, possessory form of invocation may be compared to [[loa]] possession in the [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] tradition where devotees are described as being "ridden" or "mounted" by the deity or spirit. In 1995 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] journalist [[Carol Beckwith]] described events she had witnessed during Vodoun possessions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A woman splashed sand into her eyes, a man cut his belly with shards of glass but did not bleed, another swallowed fire. Nearby a believer, perhaps a yam farmer or fisherman, heated hand-wrought knives in crackling flames. Then another man brought one of the knives to his tongue. We cringed at the sight and were dumbfounded when, after several repetitions, his tongue had not even reddened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carol |last=Beckwith |title=The African Roots of Voodoo |publisher= National Geographic 188.2 |date=August 1995 |pages=102–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Possessive invocation has also been described in certain Norse rites where [[Odin]] is invoked to "ride" workers of [[seidr]] (Norse shamanism), much like the god rides his eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]].  Indeed, forms of possessive invocation appear throughout the world in most mystical or ecstatic traditions, wherever devotees seek to touch upon the essence of a deity or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J Wallis]], ''Shamans/Neo-Shamans: Ecstasies, Alternative Archaeologies and Contemporary Pagans'', p.96 {{ISBN|0-415-30202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Command or conjuration ==
{{main|Conjuration}}
Some have performed invocation for the purpose of controlling or extracting favors from certain spirits or deities.  These invocations usually involve a commandment or threat against the entity invoked.

The following is a curious example of such an invocation, found engraved in [[cuneiform]] on a statue of the Assyrian [[demon]] [[Pazuzu]].  Although it seems to constitute an identification with the demon, it was actually considered a protective [[amulet]] with the power to command this entity not to harm people or their possessions.{{citation needed|reason=this is a potentially dangerous invocation, and its true purpose should be verified|date=March 2010}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am Pazuzu, son of the king of the evil spirits, that one who descends impetuously from the mountains and bring the storms. That is the one I am.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is found in the book [[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]] during the Conjuration of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], where the goddess is evoked into a piece of bread and threatened to grant a wish:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I do not bake the bread, nor with it salt,
Nor do I cook the honey with the wine,
I bake the body and the blood and soul,
The soul of (great) Diana, that she shall
Know neither rest nor peace, and ever be
In cruel suffering till she will grant
What I request, what I do most desire,
I beg it of her from my very heart!
And if the grace be granted, O Diana!
In honour of thee I will hold this feast,
Feast and drain the goblet deep,
We will dance and wildly leap,
And if thou grant'st the grace which I require,
Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps
Shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], ''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Self-identification with certain spirits ==
Invocation can refer to taking on the qualities of the being invoked, such as the allure of [[Aphrodite]] or the ferocity of [[Kali]]. In this instance the being is literally called up from within oneself (as an [[archetype]]) or into oneself (as an external force), depending on the personal belief system of the invoker. The main difference between this type of invocation and the possessive category described above is that the former may appear more controlled, with self-identification and deity-identification mixed together. In practice, invocations may blend many or all of these categories.  See for example this Hymn to Astarte from the [[Songs of Bilitis]], first attributed to a contemporary of [[Sappho]] (but actually written by [[Pierre Louÿs]] in the 1890s):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mother inexhaustible and incorruptible, creatures, born the first, engendered by thyself and by thyself conceived, issue of thyself alone and seeking joy within thyself, [[Astarte]]! 
Oh! Perpetually fertilized, virgin and nurse of all that is, chaste and lascivious, pure and revelling, ineffable, nocturnal, sweet, breather of fire, foam of the sea! 
Thou who accordest grace in secret, thou who unitest, thou who lovest, thou who seizest with furious desire the multiplied races of savage beasts and couplest the sexes in the wood. 
Oh, irresistible Astarte! hear me, take me, possess me, oh, Moon! and thirteen times each year draw from my womb the sweet libation of my blood!&lt;ref&gt;From the Songs of Bilitis&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Komšija'''  ({{lang-tr|komşu}}, "[[neighbourhood|neighbor]]") or '''Komšiluk''' denotes the neighborhood in the [[Balkans]]. It was in the culture for Balkan families to serve their neighbor. Balkan neighbors or komshis had special relations between them, whether they were Muslim, Christians, or Jews. Their houses had two gates or doors, one facing the street, the other leading to the komshi. Somebody could easily arrive at the komshi gate from the opposite street without  walking through a public road, people offered their komshi food from their own table. It was Balkan culture that had its origin in [[Turkish people|Turkish]] culture.

''Komshi'' is made of mutual respect, reciprocal help and assistance, work and neighbourhood relationships, and invitations to important events of a family. People engaged in a ''komšiluk'' are called ''komšije''.

Shin portrayed the ''minjok'' as a warlike race that had fought bravely to preserve Korean [[Identity (social science)|identity]], had later declined, and now needed to be reinvigorated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Miyoshi Jager]], ''Narratives of Nation Building in Korea'' (2003), pp. 15-16; Andre Schmid, "Rediscovering Manchuria" (1997), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|period of Japanese rule]] (1910&amp;ndash;1945), this belief in the uniqueness of the Korean ''minjok'' gave an impetus for [[resistance movement|resisting]] Japanese [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policies and [[history|historical]] scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Hyung-il Pai, ''Constructing "Korean" Origins: A Critical Review of Archaeology, Historiography, and Racial Myth in Korean State-Formation Theories''.

==History==
{{see also|Korean nationalist historiography}}

===Early usage and origins===
Contrary to popular belief in the Koreas, the contemporary Korean ideology of a "pure Korean race" began only in the early 20th century when the Japanese annexed Korea&lt;ref name=myers /&gt; and launched a campaign to persuade them that they were of the same pure racial stock as the Japanese themselves.&lt;ref name=ucb /&gt;

In the colonial period, the Imperial Japanese's assimilation policy claimed that Koreans and Japanese were of common origin but the former always subordinate. The pure blood theory was used to justify colonialist policies to replace Korean cultural traditions with Japanese ones in order to supposedly get rid of all distinctions and achieve equality between Koreans and inlanders.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Ethnic pride source of prejudice, discrimination] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720053258/http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802 |date=2011-07-20 }}, Gi-Wook Shin, Asia-Pacific Research Center of Stanford University, 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The policy included changing Korean names into Japanese, exclusive use of Japanese language, school instruction in the Japanese ethical system, and Shinto worship.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt; [[Brian Reynolds Myers]], a professor at [[Dongseo University]], argues that seeing the failure of the pure [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]] policy, Japanese imperial ideologues changed their policy into creating a Korean ethnic-patriotism on par with the Japanese one. They encouraged Koreans to take pride in their Koreanness, in their history, heritage, culture and "dialect" as a brother nation going back to a common ancestry with the Japanese. Thus, Korean race nationalism can be seen as a deliberate and direct creation of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese empire]].&lt;ref name="myers"/&gt;{{page number needed|date=December 2016}}

===Independence===
[[File:Baitou Mountain Tianchi.jpg|thumb|right|Heaven Lake of [[Baekdu Mountain]] where [[Hwanung]], [[Dangun]]'s father, is said to have descended from heaven, constitutes a foundation for the legend of blood purity in Korean]]

[[Shin Chaeho]] (1880–1936), the founder of the nationalistic historiography of modern Korea and a [[Korean independence movement]] activist, published his influential book of reconstructed history ''[[Joseon Sanggosa]]'' (''The Early History of Joseon'') in 1924–25, proclaiming that Koreans are descendants of [[Dangun]], the legendary ancestor of Korean people, who merged with Buyo of [[Manchuria]] to form the [[Goguryeo]] people.&lt;ref name=gries&gt;The Koguryo Controversy,
National Identity, and Sino-Korean Relations Today [http://www.ou.edu/uschina/gries/articles/texts/Gries2005KoguryoEAIQ.pdf], Peter Hays Gries, Institute for US-China Issues, The University of Oklahoma&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing from the Japanese theory of nation, Shin Chaeho located the martial roots of the Korean in Goguryeo, which he depicted as [[militarist]] and expansionist which turned out to inspire pride and confidence in the resistance against the Japanese.&lt;ref name=gries /&gt; In order to establish Korean uniqueness, he also replaced the story of [[Gija Joseon]], whose founder ([[Jizi|Gija]]) was the paternal uncle or brother of the Chinese [[Shang]] emperor [[King Zhou of Shang|Zhou]], with the Dangun legend&lt;ref&gt;Andre Schmid, "Rediscovering Manchuria: Som Cj’aeho and the Politics of Territorial History in Korea," in The Journal of Asian Studies, 56, no. 1 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted that it was an important way to establish Korea’s uniqueness.&lt;ref name=gries /&gt;

After independence in the late 1940s, despite the split between North and South Korea, neither side disputed the ethnic homogeneity of the Korean nation based on a firm conviction that they are purest descendant of a legendary genitor and half-god figure called Dangun who founded [[Gojoseon]] in 2333 BCE based on the description of the ''[[Dongguk Tonggam]]'' (1485).&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?pid=694&amp;isid=30674&amp;arid=657709&amp;topMenu=&amp;topMenu1= Old Choson and the Culture of the Mandolin-shaped Bronze Dagger], Kim Jung-bae&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
In both Koreas, pure blood theory is a common belief,&lt;ref name=soksoo&gt;Kim Sok-soo, professor at Kyungpook National University, cited in Park Chung-a, "[http://www.dhseol.org/activity/ein2006_06.html Myth of Pure-Blood Nationalism Blocks Multi-Ethnic Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725232752/http://www.dhseol.org/activity/ein2006_06.html |date=2011-07-25 }}," ''The Korea Times'', August 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with even some South Korean presidents subscribing to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-north-koreas-motives-and-why-some-south-koreans-admire-the-north-83639|title=What the West gets wrong about North Korea's motives, and why some South Koreans admire the North|first=B.R.|last=Myers|publisher=The Conversation|date=September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916082701/http://theconversation.com/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-north-koreas-motives-and-why-some-south-koreans-admire-the-north-83639|archivedate=2017-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debates on this topic can be found sporadic in the South, whereas the public opinion in the North is hard to access. In a nationalistic view, to impugn or challenge the theory would have been tantamount to betraying Koreanness in the face of the challenge of an alien ethnic nation.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;

Some Korean scholars observed that the pure blood theory served as a useful tool for the South Korean government to make its people obedient and easy to govern when the country was embroiled in ideological turmoil.&lt;ref name=soksoo /&gt; It was especially true in the dictatorial leaderships by former presidents [[Syngman Rhee]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] when nationalism was incorporated into anti-Communism.&lt;ref name=soksoo /&gt;

===Role in contemporary South Korean society===
In South Korea, the notion of "pure blood" results in discrimination toward people of both "foreign-blood" and "mixed blood".&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; Those with this "mixed blood" or "foreign blood" are sometimes referred to as ''Honhyeol'' ({{Korean|혼혈|{{lang|ko|[[wikt:混#Korean|混]][[wikt:血#Korean|血]]}}}}) in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=Timothy|title=Rethinking Belongingness in Korea: Transnational Migration, ‘Migrant Marriages,’ and the Politics of Multiculturalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/3605631/Rethinking_Belongingness_in_Korea_Transnational_Migration_Migrant_Marriages_and_the_Politics_of_Multiculturalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean nationality law is based on [[jus sanguinis]]&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=gv /&gt; instead of [[jus solis]], which is a territorial principle that takes into account the place of birth when bestowing nationality. In this context, most South Koreans have stronger attachment to South Koreans residing in foreign countries and foreigners of South Korean descent, than to naturalized South Korean citizens and expatriates residing in South Korea.&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;&lt;ref name=gv /&gt; In 2005, the opposition [[Grand National Party]] suggested a revision of the current South Korean nationality law to allow South Korean nationality to be bestowed to people who are born in South Korea regardless of the nationalities of their parents but it was discarded due to unfavorable public opinion against such a measure.&lt;ref name="Park" /&gt;


According to Jon Huer, a columnist for the ''Korea Times'': {{quote|In trying to understand [South] Korea and [South] Koreans, we must recognize how important blood is to [South] Korea. [South] Koreans love blood, both in the real sense and metaphorically. They like to shed blood, sometimes their own in cut fingers and sometimes animal blood, in protest. They hold "blood relations" as supreme, above other links and connections. They often add "flesh" and "bone" to their rhetorical statements and preferences. In short, [South] Korea is quite fond of thinking of itself and its people in terms of blood...&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/06/272_47907.html|title=Korean Blood, Real and Imagined|date=3 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
====Challenges and the future====
Emma Campbell from the [[Australian National University]] argues that the conceptions of South Korean nationalism is evolving among young people and that a new form is emerging that has globalised cultural characteristics.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=Emma |date=22 June 2015 |title=The end of ethnic nationalism? Changing conceptions of national identity and belonging among young South Koreans |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nana.12120/full |journal=[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]] |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=483–502 |doi=10.1111/nana.12120 |access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics challenge the role of ethnicity in South Korean nationalism.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; According to Campbell’s study for which she interviewed 150 South Koreans in their twenties, the desire for reunification is declining. However, these who are in favor of a [[Korean unification]] state reasons different from [[ethnic nationalism]]. The respondents stated that they only wanted unification if it would not disrupt the life in the South or if North Korea achieves economic parity with the South. A small number of respondents further mentioned that they support a "unification on the condition that it did not take place in their lifetime."&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; Another reason stated for the wish for unification was the access to North Korea’s natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt; This notion of evolving nationalism has been further elaborated by the meaning of ''uri nara'' ({{lang-ko|우리나라}} ''my country'' [sic!]) for young South Koreans, which only refers to South Korea for them instead to the whole Korean peninsula.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 488-489 --&gt; Campbell’s interviews further showed that many young South Koreans have no problems to accepting foreigners as part of ''uri nara''.&lt;ref name="Campbell-2015"/&gt;&lt;!-- p. 492 --&gt;

====Criticism====
B. R. Myers noted in a 2010 ''New York Times'' editorial that there was relatively little public outrage in South Korea over the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the ROKS ''Cheonan'']] earlier that year, which he attributed partly to a feeling of sympathy towards North Korea among South Koreans, resulting from a closer identification with the Korean race than with the South Korean state.&lt;ref name=KoreaShrug&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |title=South Korea's Collective Shrug |date=27 May 2010 |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |first=Brian Reynolds |last=Myers |authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers |accessdate=April 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419024409/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28myers.html |archivedate=April 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers also stated that race nationalism in South Korea undermines the South Korean citizenry's patriotism towards South Korea by increasing sympathy towards North Korea, thus threatening the country's national security in the face of North Korean aggression, a sentiment shared by ''Korea Times'' columnist Jon Huer.&lt;ref name="koreatimes.co.kr"/&gt; He stated that South Koreans' race nationalism "is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2011/08/01/51/0302000000AEN20110801002700315F.HTML|title=(Yonhap Feature) Brian Myers: Korea's most dangerous writer? - YONHAP NEWS|website=english.yonhapnews.co.kr|quote=This is no problem when you have a nation state like Japan or Denmark, but is a problem when you have a state divided.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers has also stated that conversely, North Korea does not suffer from this dilemma as by and large the North Korean people tend to equate the "Korean race" and the country of North Korea as being one and the same, unlike in South Korea where the "Korean race" and South Korea are largely seen as different entities, the former positively, the latter negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freekorea.us/2017/08/01/propaganda-in-the-age-of-kim-jong-un-a-discussion-with-professor-b-r-myers/#sthash.eScL76im.dpbs|title=Propaganda in the age of Kim Jong-Un: A discussion with Professor B.R.

== Social issues ==
[[File:Hines Ward vs. Chiefs.jpg|thumb|upright|American football player [[Hines Ward]]'s visit to South Korea in 2006 has stirred debate if the country's society should be more accepting of "mixed blood" people.]]

As part of the deterioration of relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, North Korea  forced its male citizens who had married Soviet and Eastern European women to divorce, whereupon the women, a few hundred, were expelled from the country.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Lankov, The Real North Korea. Life and politics in the failed Stalinist utopia (Oxford 2015) page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  North Korea is alleged to have abducted foreign women in the 1970s to marry to foreign men that immigrated to North Korea in order to keep these men from having children with North Korean women.&lt;ref name="United Nations Human Rights Council 2014"/&gt; North Korea is accused of killing babies born to North Korean mothers and Chinese fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3204509.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - N Korea 'kills detainees' babies'|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, American football player [[Hines Ward]], who was born in Seoul to a South Korean mother and a [[African American|black American]] father, became the first South Korean-born American to win the NFL Super Bowl's MVP award. This achievement threw him into the media spotlight in South Korea.&lt;ref name=finder&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06099/680735-195.stm| title=Hines Ward scores big for social change| author=Chuck Finder| work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| date=2006-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he travelled to South Korea for the first time, he raised unprecedented attention to the acceptance of "mixed-blood" children. He also donated US$1 million to establish the "Hines Ward Helping Hands Foundation", which the media called "a foundation to help mixed-race children like himself in South Korea, where they have suffered discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06150/694237-66.stm| title=Ward kicks off his new charity| author=[[Associated Press]]| work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| date=2006-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hines Ward was granted "honorary" South Korean citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?no=283952&amp;rel_no=1|title=MVP Ward Visit Exposes Korean Racism - OhmyNews International|website=english.ohmynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while some South Koreans are fascinated by the bi-racial sportsman, the majority of ordinary mixed-race people and migrant workers face various forms of discrimination and prejudice.&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; In 2007, the "Korean pure blood theory" became an international issue when the U.N.

In 2007 the South Korean government passed the [[Act on Treatment of Foreigners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=47580|title=Korean Laws in English - Act on the Treatment of Foreigners in Korea|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/5575/south-korea/south-korea-overview.html|title=Minority Rights Group International : South Korea : South Korea Overview|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613001710/http://www.minorityrights.org/5575/south-korea/south-korea-overview.html|archivedate=13 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hurights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/newsinbrief-en/section1/2008/10/south-korea-support-for-multicultural-families-act-enacted.html|title=South Korea; Support for Multicultural Families Act Enacted - ヒューライツ大阪|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2007, the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] praised the Act on Treatment of Foreigners, but also expressed a number of concerns. The Committee was concerned "about the persistence of widespread societal discrimination against foreigners, including migrant workers and children born from inter-ethnic unions, in all areas of life, including employment, marriage, housing, education and interpersonal relationships." It also noted that the terminology such as "pure blood" and "mixed blood" used in South Korea, including by the government, is widespread, and may reinforce concepts of [[Racial superiority|racist superiority]]. The committee recommended improvement in the areas of treatment of migrant workers, abuse of and violence against foreign women married to South Korean citizens, and trafficking of foreign women for the purpose of sexual exploitation or domestic servitude.&lt;ref name=uncom&gt;http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/473424062.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also noted that contrary to popular domestic perception, South Korea was no longer "ethnically homogenous".&lt;ref name=nytimes2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/world/asia/02race.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=2 November 2009|location=New York|title=Race|publisher=New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legislation aimed at improving the integration of ethnic minorities into South Korean society, the [[Support for Multicultural Families Act]], was passed in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=58481|title=Korean Laws in English - SUPPORT FOR MULTICULTURAL FAMILIES ACT|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and revised in 2011).&lt;ref name=hurights/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=89160|title=Gov’t extends definition of multicultural families|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2009 statistics published by South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, there were 144,385 couples of international marriage in South Korea as of May 2008. 88.4% of immigrants were female, and 61.9% were from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.naver.com/view.nhn?doc_id=39555627&amp;dir_id=0&amp;page=0&amp;query=%EB%8B%A4%EB%AC%B8%ED%99%94%20%ED%86%B5%EA%B3%84|title=2009년 다문화가족 통계현황 (09년 4월현재):네이버 전문정보|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently{{When|date=January 2016}} it has been argued that South Korean society had already become a multicultural society, although foreigners make up for 3.4% of the South Korean population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sung-won|first1=Eum|title=Number of foreign residents in S.

Existing provisions in South Korean criminal law may be used to punish acts of racial discrimination, but were never used for that purpose&lt;ref name=uncom/&gt; until 2009, when the first case of a South Korean citizen verbally insulting a foreigner have been brought to court.&lt;ref name=nytimes2009/&gt;

In 2010, the South Korean government changed the oath of enlistment of Korean soldiers, so that they do not swear allegiance anymore to the Korean race, stating that this shows openness to multiculturalism.&lt;ref name=OathChosunIlbo&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/04/18/2011041801112.html |title=New Pledge of Allegiance to Reflect Growing Multiculturalism |quote=The military has decided to omit the word 'minjok,' which refers to the Korean race, from the oath of enlistment for officers and soldiers, and replace it with 'the citizen.'

In [[New Zealand folklore]], the '''Kumi Lizard''' is a purported reptile, possibly a giant [[monitor lizard]], which allegedly once lived in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/animals-mythical/1 1966 in ''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''New Zealand Mysteries'', author Robyn Gosset refers to a sighting of a Kumi in 1898 by a Maori bushman. Its length was estimated at 1.5 metres. In the first edition of the book, Gosset refers to several more accounts of the lizard which are absent from the second edition. These include an account from captain [[James Cook]], who was told by Maori in [[Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand)|Queen Charlotte Sound]] that huge, [[arboreal]] lizards were present in the surrounding bushland, and that they were greatly feared, as well as a sighting from 1875 of a large lizard washed up in a flooded [[Hokianga]] river and the discovery of bones possibly from the animal that same year.

More recent reports both come from 1898, one describing a large reptile seen near [[Gisbourne]], the other a huge creature akin to a monitor lizard which advanced toward a bushman in [[Arowhana]] before retreating into a [[Metrosideros|Rata]] tree. Although the animal itself was not spotted again, photographs of its footprints were taken.&lt;ref&gt;Gosset, Robyn. (1996). ''New Zealand Mysteries''. The Bush Press of New Zealand, pages 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8676">The '''last offices''', or '''laying out''', is the procedures performed, usually by a [[nurse]], to the body of a dead person shortly after [[death]] has been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;http://bereavementsupport.co.uk/how-will-the-person-be-cared-for-immediately-after-they-have-died/the-person-has-died-in-hospital/&lt;/ref&gt; They can vary between [[hospital|hospitals]] and between [[culture|cultures]].

==Name==
The word "offices" is related to the original [[Latin]], in which ''officium'' means "service, duty,  business".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=office&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence these are the "last duties" carried out on the body.

==Aims==
*To prepare the deceased for the mortuary (a funeral home or morgue), respecting their cultural beliefs
*To comply with legislation, in particular where the death of a patient requires the involvement of a Procurator Fiscal aka. Coroner
*To minimise any risk of cross-infection to relative, health care worker or persons who may need to handle the deceased
&lt;ref&gt;Rana, D., &amp; Upton, D. (2009). Psychology for nurses. Essex, UK: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
Often the body of the deceased is left for up to an [[hour]] as a mark of respect. The procedure then typically includes the following steps, though they can vary according to an institution's preferred practices:
*Removal of [[jewellery]] unless requested otherwise by the deceased's family. If left on it must be documented in the patient's property list.
*[[Wounds]], including [[Skin ulcer|pressure sores]], should be covered with a waterproof [[dressing (medical)|dressing]]. Tube insertion points should be padded with gauze and tape to avoid purging.
*The patient is laid on his/her back with arms by their side (unless religious customs demand otherwise). [[Eyelid]]s are closed.
*The [[jaw]] is often supported with a pillow or cervical collar.
*[[Dentures]] should be left in place, unless inappropriate.
*The [[bladder]] is drained by applying pressure on the lower [[abdomen]]. Orifices are blocked only if leakage of body fluid is evident.
*The body is then washed and dried, the mouth cleaned and the face shaved.
*An identification bracelet is put on the [[ankle]] detailing: the name of the patient; date of birth; date and time of death; name of ward (if patient died in hospital); patient identification number.
*The body is dressed in a simple garment or wrapped in a shroud. An identification label duplicating the above information is pinned to the wrap or shroud.
*A stretcher drawsheet is placed under the body to enable removal to a trolley for transportation to the morgue. These trolleys may often be disguised to resemble laundry carts if transportation has to pass through areas where members of the public may be present.

==Bathing the dead==
'''Washing the body of a dead person''', sometimes as part of a [[religious]] [[ritual]], is a customary [[funerary]] practice in several cultures. It was delegated to professionals in ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, by well-off [[Victorian (era)|Victorians]], and continues so in modern America, but was traditionally performed by "family, friends, and neighbors."&lt;ref name="Quigley2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christine Quigley|title=The Corpse: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM4BqO68wxEC&amp;pg=PA52|date=1 January 2005|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-2449-8|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Main|Bereavement in Judaism}} 
It is part of traditional [[Judaism|Jewish]] burial rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/nyregion/13burial.html|title=Reviving a Ritual of Tending to the Dead|work=The New York Times|date=December 12, 2010|author=Paul Vitello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Inquisition]] in Spain, bodies undergoing preparation for burial were sometimes scrutinized for signs that they had been washed, since this was seen as a marker of secret Jewish practice ([[crypto-Judaism]]).&lt;ref name="Eire2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carlos M. N. Eire|title=From Madrid to Purgatory: The Art and Craft of Dying in Sixteenth-Century Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEU-Nt9lRdsC&amp;pg=PA86|date=25 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52942-6|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism and Hinduism===
Bathing of the dead, known as ''yukan'', is also found in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Handbook of Death and Dying | editor1-last = Bryant | editor1-first= Clifton D. | editor-link = Clifton D. Bryant | year = 2003 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | page = 664}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC&amp;pg=PA153|date=10 March 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
It is a religious practice in [[Islam]], where the body is washed by members of the dead person's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/12/AR2010031202891.html|title=The Washing: In the Muslim custom of bathing the dead, she found a deep sense of reward -- and shaved off 40 sins|author=Reshma Memon Yaqub|date= March 21, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; When possible, three washings are performed: first with water infused with [[plum]] leaves, then with water infused with [[camphor]], and lastly with purified water.&lt;ref name="Bern-Klug2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mercedes Bern-Klug|title=Transforming Palliative Care in Nursing Homes: The Social Work Role|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtu80unvyV8C&amp;pg=PA262|date=13 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50707-3|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The washing is usually performed by others of the same gender, although Islamic [[Hausa people]] permit spouses to wash each other's bodies.&lt;ref name="JosephNaǧmābādī2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Suad Joseph|author2=Afsāna Naǧmābādī|title=Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures: Family, Body, Sexuality And Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzXzWgVajnQC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12819-0|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In West Africa===
Funerary bathing is performed in traditional funerals in some countries in [[West Africa]]. The ritual washing of the dead is believed to be one of the factors which resulted in the rapid spread of [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola virus]] in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-ebola-outbreak-so-bad-sierra-leone-emergency-quarantine-180952218/|title=The Difficulty of Burying Ebola's Victims|author=Mary Beth Griggs|date=July 31, 2014|publisher=Smithsonian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural references===
[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] speaks of washing the dead in accordance with the Greek custom, although she was limited to pouring water on the body of her brother [[Polyneikes]].&lt;ref name="Gibbons2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reginald Gibbons|title=Antigone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPI6agP4io0C&amp;pg=PT186|date=26 April 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-984020-5|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of bathing the dead has been depicted in a number of films. In the 1995 film ''[[Braveheart]]'', a young [[William Wallace]] watches as women bathe the bodies of his father and brother, who were killed in battle against English troops during the 13th century. The 2009 film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' depicts the washing of a deceased housewife in a Northern German village just before [[World War I]]. In the film ''[[A Midnight Clear]]'' (1992), set in the [[Battle of the Ardennes]] in [[World War II]], a small group of soldiers are able to take a brief respite from the war when they procure a bath tub and heat up some water.  After all have bathed, they wash the body of a comrade who was recently killed while trying to help a unit of German soldiers.

An episode of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' shows [[Nate Fisher]]'s body being "slowly and methodically" washed by his mother and brother.&lt;ref name="Ashenburg2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Ashenburg|title=The Dirt on Clean: An Unsanitized History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4a7cAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|date=8 April 2014|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4668-6776-5|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Li Europan lingues''''' is a quotation in [[Occidental language|Occidental]], an [[international auxiliary language]] devised by [[Edgar von Wahl]] in 
1922. It is used in some [[HTML]] [[Web template|template]]s as a fill-in or [[Filler text|placeholder]] text.  

One of the most common placeholder texts is [[lorem ipsum]]. A similar text of this type is the [[pangram]] ''[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]'', which is often used in fill-in text and to demonstrate and compare [[typeface]]s because it contains all 26 letters of the [[Latin alphabet]].

==Text==

When used as placeholder text, ''Li Europan lingues'' is usually one or two paragraphs and reads as follows:

:''Li Europan lingues es membres del sam familie. Lor separat existentie es un myth. Por scientie, musica, sport etc, litot Europa usa li sam vocabular. Li lingues differe solmen in li grammatica, li pronunciation e li plu commun vocabules. Omnicos directe al desirabilite de un nov lingua franca: On refusa continuar payar custosi traductores.''

:''At solmen va esser necessi far uniform grammatica, pronunciation e plu commun paroles. Ma quande lingues coalesce, li grammatica del resultant lingue es plu simplic e regulari quam ti del coalescent lingues. Li nov lingua franca va esser plu simplic e regulari quam li existent Europan lingues. It va esser tam simplic quam Occidental in fact, it va esser Occidental. A un Angleso it va semblar un simplificat Angles, quam un skeptic Cambridge amico dit me que Occidental es.''

;English translation:

:''The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.''

:''To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me that Occidental is.''

==History and discovery of ''Li Europan lingues'' text==

The text of ''Li Europan lingues'' is found in many HTML templates and through copying and uploading of templates this phrase seems to have found its use in many websites.

[[Don Harlow]] posted a message to the Auxlang List on 5 August 2006, mentioning its appearance in the "[[CSS Cookbook]]" from [[O'Reilly]] by [[Christopher Schmitt]], and in templates of webpages which implement [[CSS]]. [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0608a&amp;L=auxlang&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=7343]

[[Don Gasper]] posted another message to the same list suggesting a possible source:
:I have a theory, but it is only a theory. The Interlinguist/Occidentalist Ilmari Federn, who later adopted the name [[Charles Sprague (linguist)|Charles Sprague]] and came to live in England in the late 1930s, worked at the "[[Financial Times]]" in London. I think in the newspaper press. It is possible that he added the text in Interlingue to the standard Lorem ipsum passage. Unfortunately, I never asked him about this when I got to know him in the latter years of his life, in the early 1990s.

William Patterson was pleasantly surprised that evening to read about the appearance of [http://www.kafejo.com/misc/lorem.htm his version] of ''Lorem ipsum'' in the "CSS Cookbook" and quickly confessed. In June 1998, at a time when he was dabbling in Occidental, he had come across the ''Lorem ipsum'' text somewhere and learned about its use as a template. As was his wont when learning something new like that, he created a webpage about it. But while warning about the existence of "corrupt" versions, he offered one himself which included some Occidental text, a dash of [[Esperanto]], some variations of his given name, and a little bit of nonsense. In September 2002 he came across a copy of his version on the Web. Curious, he searched for other instances, and found that on 10 September 2002, an [[AllTheWeb]] search for the strings "ulliam" and "willum" returned 513 hits; by 10 December 2002, 962; and by 14 October 2003, 2337. (One page which he found particularly amusing was a Swedish translation of his own webpage&amp;mdash; Occidental, commentary, page colors, page title ''"Ailanto : Lorem ipsum"'' and all!) And now it's in the "CSS Cookbook"!

An HTML comment in the page that started it all attributes the Occidental text itself to [[S. W. Beer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">'''"Low culture"''' is a derogatory term for forms of [[popular culture]] that have [[Commoner|mass appeal]]. Its contrast is "[[high culture]]", which can also be derogatory. It has been said by [[culture theory|culture theorists]] that both high culture and low culture are [[subculture]]s.

The boundaries of low culture and high culture blur, through convergence. Many people are "omnivores", making cultural choices from different menus.

== Standards and definitions of low culture ==

In his book ''Popular Culture and High Culture'', [[Herbert J. Gans]] gives a definition of how to identify and create low culture:
{{quote|Aesthetic standards of low culture stress substance, form and being totally subservient; there is no explicit concern with abstract ideas or even with fictional forms of contemporary social problems and issues. ... Low culture emphasizes morality but limits itself to familial and individual problems and [the] values, which apply to such problems. Low culture is content to depict traditional working class values winning out over the temptation to give into conflicting impulses and behavior patterns.|Herbert Gans|&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Gans, ''Popular Culture and High Culture'' pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When applying that lens to mass media, it often includes shows that do not go too deeply into abstract ideas, or that do not address head-on contemporary social problems.

== Culture as class ==
Herbert Gans states in his book ''Popular Culture and High Culture'' that the different classes of culture are linked correspondingly to socio-economic and educational classes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Popular-Culture-High-Analysis-Evaluation/dp/0465026095 Herbert Gans ''Popular Culture and High Culture'' pg. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;
For any given socio-economic class, there is a culture for that class. Hence the terms high and low culture and the manifestation of those terms as they appeal to their respective constituents.

== Mass media ==

=== Audience ===
All cultural products (especially high culture) have a certain demographic to which they appeal most. Low culture appeals to very simple and basic human needs plus offers a perceived return to innocence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Discovering-Popular-Culture-Longman-Topics/dp/0321355962 , Anna Tomisino ''Discovering Pop Culture'', pg. 211.]&lt;/ref&gt; the escape from real world problems, or the experience of living vicariously through viewing someone else’s life on television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Discovering-Popular-Culture-Longman-Topics/dp/0321355962 , Anna Tomisino ''Discovering Pop Culture'', pg. 225 (although this is an excerpt from "The Happiest Place On Earth: Disney" by Eric Mazur and Tara Koda.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stereotypes ====
Low culture can be formulaic, employing [[Trope (literature)|trope conventions]], [[stock character]]s and character [[archetype]]s in a manner that can be perceived as more simplistic, crude, emotive, unbalanced, or blunt compared to high culture's implementations&amp;mdash;which may be perceived as more subtle, balanced, or refined and open for interpretations.

{{redirect|Narrator}}
'''Narration''' is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narration encompasses a set of techniques through which the [[author|creator of the story]] presents their story, including:
* '''Narrative point of view'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ezproxy.dacc.edu:4443/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.dacc.edu:4048/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=98402287&amp;site=eds-live|title=Narration|last=Woltag|first=Laura|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: the perspective (or type of personal or non-personal "lens") through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative voice'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: the format through which a story is communicated
* '''Narrative time''': the [[grammatical tense|grammatical placement]] of the story's time-frame in the past, the present, or the future.

A ''narrator'' is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator (author) of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. In the case of most written narratives (novels, short stories, poems, etc.), the narrator typically functions to convey the story in its entirety. The narrator may be a voice devised by the author as an anonymous, non-personal, or stand-alone entity; as the author as a character; or as some other fictional or non-fictional character appearing and participating within their own story. The narrator is considered ''participant'' if he/she is a character within the story, and  ''non-participant'' if he/she is an implied character or an omniscient or semi-omniscient being or voice that merely relates the story to the audience without being involved in the actual events. Some stories have [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to illustrate the storylines of various characters at the same, similar, or different times, thus allowing a more complex, non-singular point of view.

Narration encompasses not only ''who'' tells the story, but also ''how'' the story is told (for example, by using [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] or [[unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]]). In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.

== Narrative point of view ==
Narrative point of view or narrative perspective describes the position of the narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=James McCracken|title=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/|accessdate=October 16, 2011|edition=Online|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be thought of as a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that can also look back inside the narrator's mind.

=== First-person ===
{{Main article|First-person narrative}}
With the ''first-person'' point of view, a story is revealed through a narrator who is also explicitly a [[Character (arts)|character]] within his or her own story. In a first person narrative, the narrator can create a close relationship between the reader and the writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyile|first=Andrea Schwenke|date=1999|title=Expanding the View of First-Person Narration|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=185–202|doi=10.1023/a:1022433202145|issn=0045-6713}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the narrator reveals the plot by referring to this viewpoint character with forms of "I" (that is, the narrator is a person who openly acknowledges his or her own existence) or, when part of a larger group, "we". Frequently, the narrator is the [[protagonist]], whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A conscious narrator, as a human participant of past events, is an incomplete witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. Forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the [[focal character]].

=== Second-person ===

The ''second-person'' point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of the pronouns "you", "your", and "yours." The narrator is trying to address the audience, not necessarily directly, but rather to administer more of a connection. Stories and novels in second person are comparatively rare.  Examples include the short fiction of [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Junot Díaz]]. An example in contemporary literature is [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]],'' in which the second-person narrator is observing his life from a distance as a way to cope with a trauma he keeps hidden from readers for most of the book.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy."—Opening lines of [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|third}}Third-person&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ===
In the ''third-person'' narrative mode, characters are referred to by the narrator as "he", "she", or "they", but never as "I" or "we" (first-person), or "you" (second-person). This makes it clear that the narrator is an unspecified [[entity]] or uninvolved person who conveys the story and is not a character of any kind within the story, or at least is not referred to as such.&lt;ref name="Ricoeur1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Ricoeur|title=Time and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjBw9NuSkuEC&amp;pg=PA89|date=15 September 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71334-2|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied "commentary" or "voice", rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the  "he/she" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid.  ''The Narrator'', Iran: Baqney 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with ''third person subjective'' narration describing one or more character's personal feelings and thoughts, and ''third person objective'' narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. The second axis is the omniscient/limited axis, a distinction that refers to the knowledge held by the narrator. A ''third person omniscient'' narrator has, or seems to have, access to knowledge of all characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts; however, a ''third person limited '' narrator, in contrast, knows information about, and within the minds of, only a limited number of characters (often just one character). A limited narrator cannot describe anything outside of a focal character's particular knowledge and experiences.

=== Alternating person ===
While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have experimented with other points of view that, for example, alternate between different narrators who are all first-person, or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative perspective. The ten books of the ''[[Pendragon: Journal of an Adventure through Time and Space|Pendragon]]'' adventure series, by [[D. J. MacHale]], switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey and the disembodied third-person perspective of his friends back home.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Claire E (2004). "[http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/oct04/a-conversation-with-d-j-machale-10041 A Conversation With D.J. MacHale]." ''The Internet Writing Journal''. Writer Write, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Alias Grace]]'' provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]''.

[[Audrey Niffenegger]]'s ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife]]'' is a love story, told in alternating first person. This novel alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. Henry’s disorder called Chronic-Displacement causes him to be put in the wrong time. He is then put in emotional parts from his past and future, going back and forth in time. [[John Green (author)|John Green]] &amp; [[David Levithan]]'s novel ''[[Will Grayson, Will Grayson]]'' rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[A Long Way Down]]'' has four narrators who also, are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as “the suicide spot” and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group, and continue to meet up.

== Narrative voice ==
The narrative voice is essential for story telling, because it's setting up the story for the reader, for example, by "viewing" a character's thought processes, reading a letter written for someone, retelling a character's experiences, etc.

=== Stream-of-consciousness voice ===
{{Main article|Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)}}
A ''stream of consciousness'' gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]''. Irish writer [[James Joyce]] exemplifies this style in his novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

=== Character voice ===
One of the most common narrative voices, used especially with first- and third-person viewpoints, is the ''character voice'', in which a conscious "person" (in most cases, a living human being) is presented as the narrator; this character is called a ''viewpoint character''. In this situation, the narrator is no longer an unspecified entity; rather, the narrator is a more relatable, realistic character who may or may not be involved in the actions of the story and who may or may not take a biased approach in the [[storytelling]]. If the character is directly involved in the plot, this narrator is also called the viewpoint character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include [[Doctor Watson]], Scout in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and Nick Carraway of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.

==== Unreliable voice ====
{{Main article|Unreliable narrator}}
The unreliable narrative voice involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. The narrator of Poe's "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]," for example, is significantly biased, unknowledgeable, ignorant, childish, or is perhaps purposefully trying to deceive the audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third-person narrator may be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jlse.2017.46.issue-1/jls-2017-0005/jls-2017-0005.xml Unreliable Third Person Narration? The Case of Katherine Mansfield], ''Journal of Literary Semantics,'' Vol. 46, Issue 1, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistolary voice ===
{{Main article|Epistolary novel}}

The ''epistolary narrative voice'' uses a (usually fictional) series of letters and other documents to convey the plot of the story. Although epistolary works can be considered multiple-person narratives, they also can be classified separately, as they arguably have no narrator at all—just an author who has gathered the documents together in one place. One example is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]],'' which is a story written in a sequence of letters. Another is [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', which tells the story in a series of diary entries, letters and newspaper clippings. ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons), ''by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is again made up of the correspondence between the main characters, most notably the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. Langston Hughes does the same thing in a shorter form in his story "Passing", which consists of a young man's letter to his mother.

=== Third-person voices ===
The third-person narrative voices are narrative-voice techniques employed solely under the category of the third-person view.

==== {{anchor|omni3}}Third-person, omniscient&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt; ====
Historically, the ''third-person omniscient'' (or simply ''omniscient'') perspective has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by [[Charles Dickens]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Eliot]]. A story in this narrative mode is presented by a narrator with an overarching point of view, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Herman |first1=David |last2=Jahn |first2=Manfred |last3=Ryan |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory |year=2005 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-28259-8 |page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of omniscience is that this mode enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, truthfulness) of the plot. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable – although the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters.

In addition to reinforcing the sense of the narrator as reliable (and thus of the story as true), the main advantage of this mode is that it is eminently suited to telling huge, sweeping, epic stories, and/or complicated stories involving numerous characters. The disadvantage of this mode is the increased distance between the audience and the story, and the fact that – when used in conjunction with a sweeping, epic "cast-of-thousands" story – characterization tends to be limited, thus reducing the reader's ability to identify with or sympathize with the characters. A classic example of both the advantages and disadvantages of this mode is [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==== Third-person, subjective ====
The ''third-person subjective'' is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If there is just one character, it can be termed ''third-person limited'', in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character (often the [[protagonist]]) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using "he", "she", "it", and "they", but not "I". This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'', or Santiago in [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as "third person, subjective" modes that switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters.

This style, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the "over the shoulder" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in [[Robert Jordan]]'s ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', or [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.

The [[focal character]], [[protagonist]], [[antagonist]], or some other character's thoughts are revealed through the narrator. The reader learns the events of the narrative through the perceptions of the chosen character.

==== Third-person, objective ====
The ''third-person objective'' employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode, outside of fiction, is often employed by newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a "fly-on-the-wall" or "camera lens" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given voice through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. A typical example of this so-called ''camera-eye perspective'' is ''[[Hills Like White Elephants]]'' by [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This narrative mode is also called the ''third-person dramatic'' because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot—merely an uninvolved onlooker. It was also used around the mid-20th century by French novelists writing in the ''nouveau roman'' tradition.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

==== Third-person, free/indirect ====
{{main|Free indirect speech}}
The third person indirect style or [[Free indirect speech|free indirect style]] is a method of presenting a character's voice freely and spontaneously in the middle of an otherwise third-person non-personal narrator.

==== Third-person, alternating ====

Many stories, especially in literature, alternate between the third person limited and third person omniscient. In this case, an author will move back and forth between a more [[omniscient]] third-person narrator to a more personal third-person limited narrator. Typically, like the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series and the books by [[George R. R. Martin]], a switch of third-person limited viewpoint on some character is done only at chapter boundaries. ''[[The Home and the World]]'', written in 1916 by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series the point of view changes between characters at intervals.The ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series is told in "third person limited" (in which the reader is "limited" to the thoughts of some particular character) for much of the seven novels. However, it deviates to omniscient on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the limited view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, Snape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7475-8108-6|location=London|pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narrative time ==
The ''narrative tense'' or ''narrative time'' determines the [[grammatical tense]] of the story, meaning whether it is presented as occurring before, during, or after the time of narration, that is, in the past, present, or future. In narration using the past tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring before the time at which the narrative was constructed or expressed to an audience or before the present moment; this is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. In the present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring now—at the current moment—in [[present|real time]]. In English, this tense, also known as the "[[historical present]]", is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' trilogy by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the present moment, in a time-period yet to come. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of the future, so many future-tense stories have a [[prophecy|prophetic]] tone.

== Other narrative modes ==

=== Fiction-writing mode ===
''Narration'' has more than one meaning. In its broadest sense, narration encompasses all forms of storytelling, fictional or not: personal anecdotes, "true crime", and historical narratives all fit here, along with many other non-fiction forms. More narrowly, however, the term ''narration'' refers to all written fiction. In its most restricted sense, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator communicates directly to the reader.

Along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[description]], narration (broadly defined) is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. In the context of rhetorical modes, the purpose of narration is to tell a story or to narrate an event or series of events. Narrative may exist in a variety of forms: biographies, anecdotes, short stories, or novels. In this context, all written fiction may be viewed as narration.

Narrowly defined, narration is the fiction-writing mode whereby the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. But if the broad definition of narration includes all written fiction, and the narrow definition is limited merely to that which is directly communicated to the reader, then what comprises the rest of written fiction? The remainder of written fiction would be in the form of any of the other fiction-writing modes. Narration, as a fiction-writing mode, is a matter for discussion among fiction writers and writing coaches.

The ability to use the different points of view is one measure of a person's writing skill. The writing [[Marking scheme|mark schemes]] used for [[National Curriculum assessment]]s in [[England]] reflect this: they encourage the awarding of marks for the use of viewpoint as part of a wider judgment.

=== Other types and uses ===
In literature, ''person'' is used to describe the viewpoint from which the [[narrative]] is presented. Although second-person perspectives are occasionally used, the most commonly encountered are first and third person. ''Third person omniscient'' specifies a viewpoint in which readers are provided with information not available to characters within the story; without this qualifier, readers may or may not have such information.

In [[film|movies]] and [[video game]]s first- and third-person describe [[virtual camera system|camera viewpoints]]. The first-person is from a character's own perspective, and the third-person is the more familiar, "general" camera showing a scene. A so-called second-person may also be used to show a main character from a secondary character's perspective.

For example, in a [[horror film]], the first-person perspective of an [[antagonist]] could become a second-person perspective on a potential victim's actions. A third-person shot of the two characters could be used to show the narrowing distance between them.

In video games, a first-person perspective is used most often in the [[first-person shooter]] genre, such as in ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', or in simulations (racing games, flight [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], and such). Third-person perspectives on characters are typically used in all other games. Since the arrival of [[3D computer graphics]] in games it is often possible for the player to switch between first- and third-person perspectives at will; this is usually done to improve spatial awareness, but can also improve the accuracy of weapons use in generally third-person games such as the ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' franchise.

Text-based [[interactive fiction]] conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing, such as [[Zork]]. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from [[Spiderweb Software]] which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions.  [[Charles Stross]]'s novel [[Halting State]] was written in second person as an allusion to this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-441-01498-9|title=Halting State, Review|work=Publishers Weekly|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/05/and-another-thing.html|title=And another thing|author=Charles Stross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outdoor literature''' is a [[literature]] genre about or involving the outdoors. Outdoor literature encompasses several different [[literature|subgenre]]s including exploration literature, adventure literature, mountain literature and [[nature writing]]. Another subgenre is the [[guide book]], an early example of which was [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s guide to the [[Lake District]] published in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas West, (1821) [1778]. ''A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire''. Kendal: W. Pennington.&lt;/ref&gt; The genres can include activities such as exploration, survival, [[sailing]], [[hiking]], [[mountaineering]], [[whitewater]] boating, [[geocaching]] or [[kayaking]], or writing about nature and the environment.  [[Travel literature]] is similar to outdoor literature but differs in that it does not always deal with the out-of-doors, but there is a considerable overlap between these genres, in particular with regard to long journeys.

==History==
[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'' (1854) is an early and influential work. Although not entirely an outdoor work (he lived in a cabin close to civilization) he expressed the ideas of why  people go out into the wilderness to camp, backpack and hike: to get away from the rush of modern society and simplify life. This was a new perspective for the time and thus ''Walden'' has had a lasting influence on most outdoor authors.

{{quote|Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced […] Events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at Walden Pond have been influenced by it, including the national park system, the British labour movement, the creation of India, the civil rights movement, the hippie revolution, the environmental movement, and the wilderness movement. Today, Thoreau's words are quoted with feeling by liberals, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, and conservatives alike.| [[Ken Kifer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phred.org/~alex/kenkifer/www.kenkifer.com/thoreau/index.htm Analysis and Notes on Walden]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Walden Pond, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Walden Pond]] ]]
[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879), about his travels in [[Cévennes]] (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first [[sleeping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Travel with a Donkey in the Cevennes'' (1879); Re the first sleeping bag in 1876 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/gh5qCU47Ryyc2fOqSjKiLw]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of sailing [[Joshua Slocum]]'s ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'' (1900) is a classic of outdoor literature.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Slocum Society: [http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1895, Joshua Slocum set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and in  ''Sailing Alone Around the World'',&lt;ref name=SailingAlone&gt;Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; he described his departure:

{{quote|I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. […] A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.}}

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, he returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world, a distance of more than 46,000 miles (74,000&amp;nbsp;km).

The [[National Outdoor Book Award]] was established in 1997 as a [[United States|US]]-based non-profit program which each year honours the best in outdoor writing and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;National Outdoor Book Awards Official site:[http://www.noba-web.org/PastWins.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4368">'''Paratext''' is a concept in [[literature|literary interpretation]].  The [[Text (literary theory)|main text]] of published authors (e.g. the story, non-fiction description, poems, etc.) is often surrounded by other material supplied by the authors, editors, printers, and publishers, which is known as the paratext. These added elements form a frame for the main text, and can change the reception of a text or its interpretation by the public. Paratext is most often associated with [[book]]s, as they typically include a cover (with associated [[cover art]]), title, [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] (dedication, opening information, foreword), [[Book design#Back matter (end matter)|back matter]] (endpapers, colophon) footnotes, and many other materials not crafted by the author. Other editorial decisions can also fall into the category of paratext, such as the formatting or typography. Because of their close association with the text, it may seem that authors should be given the final say about paratextual materials, but often that is not the case. One example of controversy surrounding paratext is the case of the 2009 young adult novel ''[[Liar (novel)|Liar]]'', which was initially published with an image of a white girl on the cover, although the narrator of the story was identified in the text as black.

The concept of paratext is closely related to the concept of [[hypotext]], which is the earlier text that serves as a source for the current text.

==Theory==
[[literary theory|Literary theorist]] [[Gérard Genette]] defines paratext as those things in a published work that accompany the text, things such as the author's name, the title, [[preface]] or [[introduction (essay)|introduction]], or [[illustration]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Genette ''Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation'' page 1&lt;/ref&gt;
Genette states "More than a boundary or a sealed border, the paratext is, rather, a threshold." It is "a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that ... is at the service of a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it". Then quoting [[Philippe Lejeune]], Genette further describes paratext as "a fringe of the printed text which in reality controls one's whole reading of the text". This threshold consists of a peritext, consisting of elements such as titles, chapter titles, prefaces and notes. It also includes an epitext, which consists of elements such as interviews, publicity announcements, reviews by and addresses to critics, private letters and other authorial and editorial discussions – 'outside' of the text in question. The paratext is the sum of the peritext and epitext.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intertextuality|last=Allen|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-17475-6|location=USA and Canada|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plot drift''' is a phenomenon in storytelling in which the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the story deviates from its apparent initial direction. The phenomenon can affect written works, although it is often more noticeable in performed media such as [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s. Plot drift is generally (though not always) seen as contrary to good storytelling technique.

A sign of plot drift can be the increased introduction of new characters and settings near the end of a story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

A contrary literary technique might include the apparent introduction of plot drift, only to later reveal a connection to the rest of the story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

'''Psychological thriller''' is a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] narrative which emphasizes the unstable or delusional psychological states of its characters. In terms of context and convention, it is a [[Genre#Subgenre|subgenre]] of the broader ranging thriller narrative structure,&lt;ref name = DictionaryDotCom&gt;Dictionary.com, definition, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/psychological+thriller psychological thriller (definition)], Accessed November 3, 2013, "...a suspenseful movie or book emphasizing the psychology of its characters rather than the plot; this subgenre of thriller movie or book – Example: In a psychological thriller, the characters are exposed to danger on a mental level rather than a physical one....",&lt;/ref&gt; with similarities to [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] and [[detective fiction]] in the sense of sometimes having a "dissolving sense of reality". It is often told through the viewpoint of psychologically stressed characters, revealing their distorted mental perceptions and focusing on the complex and often tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters.&lt;ref name = Blackwell&gt;Christopher Pittard, Blackwell Reference, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405182904_chunk_g978140518290418_ss1-14 Psychological Thrillers], Accessed November 3, 2013, "...characteristics of the genre as “a dissolving sense of reality; reticence in moral pronouncements; obsessive, pathological characters; the narrative privileging of complex, tortured relationships” ( Munt 1994)..."&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers often incorporate elements of [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[Drama (film and television)|drama]], [[action film|action]], and [[paranoia]]. Not to be confused with [[psychological horror]], which involves more terror than [[wikt:psychosomatic|psychosomatic]] themes.

==Definition==
Peter Hutchings states varied films have been labeled psychological thrillers, but it usually refers to "narratives with domesticated settings in which action is suppressed and where thrills are provided instead via investigations of the psychologies of the principal characters."&lt;ref name=hutchings&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of Horror|last=Hutchings|first=Peter|page=253|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9780810870505|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC&amp;pg=PA253}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinguishing characteristic of a psychological thriller is it emphasizes the mental states of its characters: their perceptions, thoughts, distortions, and general struggle to grasp reality.&lt;ref name=packer&gt;{{cite book|title=Movies and the Modern Psyche | last=Packer | first=Sharon | publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2007|isbn=9780275993597|pages=87–90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX4goUP_yh0C&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to director [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]], psychological thrillers focus on story, character development, choice, and moral conflict; fear and anxiety drive the psychological tension in unpredictable ways. Madden stated their lack of spectacle and strong emphasis on character led to their decline in Hollywood popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/9032326/John-Madden-on-psychological-thrillers.html|title=John Madden on Psychological Thrillers|last=Bowie-Sell|first=Daisy|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=2012-01-23|accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers are suspenseful by exploiting uncertainty over characters' motives, honesty, and how they see the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Erin|last=Whitney|date=2012-11-15|work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]|url=http://www.backstage.com/interview/gretchen-mol-returns-stage-modern-thriller-good-mother/|title=Gretchen Mol Returns to the Stage in 'The Good Mother'|accessdate=2013-08-21|quote="element of a psychological thriller because ... suspenseful feeling of who did what, who's being honest ... about perception..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films can also cause discomfort in audiences by privileging them with information they wish to share with the characters; guilty characters may suffer similar distress by virtue of their knowledge.&lt;ref name="packer" /&gt;

However, [[James N. Frey]] defines psychological thrillers as a style, rather than a subgenre; Frey states good thrillers focus on the psychology of their antagonists and build suspense slowly through ambiguity.&lt;ref name="frey"&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Write a Damn Good Thriller|last=Frey|first=James N.|authorlink=James N. Frey|pages=15–19|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] | year=2010 | isbn=9781429913638|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POPvQNgZYIQC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators and/or film distributors or publishers who seek to distance themselves from the negative connotations of horror often categorize their work as a psychological thriller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/story/six-things-that-still-drive-me-psycho|title=Six Things that Still Drive Me Psycho|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[DreadCentral]]|date=2008-05-27|accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same situation can occur when critics label a work to be a psychological thriller in order to elevate its perceived literary value.&lt;ref name="frey" /&gt;

==Literary devices and techniques==
* [[Plot twist]] – Films such as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[The Skeleton Key]]'' have advertised the fact that they contain plot twists and asked audiences to refrain from revealing spoilers. Psychological thrillers with poorly received plot twists, such as ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]'', have suffered in the box office.&lt;ref name=twist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-08-11-skeleton-key-main_x.htm|title=This Shocking Twist Is ... Secret|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2005-08-11|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unreliable narrator]] – [[Andrew Taylor (author)|Andrew Taylor]] identifies the unreliable narrator as a common literary device used in psychological thrillers and traces it back to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s influence on the genre. Criminal insanity may be explored as a theme.&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7833135.stm|title=The DNA of detection|last=Taylor|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Taylor (author)|work=[[BBC]]|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MacGuffin]] – Alfred Hitchcock pioneered the concept of the MacGuffin, a goal or item that helps to move the plot. The MacGuffin is frequently only vaguely defined, and it can be used to increase [[suspense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/971272-196/the-week-in-preview-i-am-a.html|title=The Week in Preview: "I am a typed director. If I made Cinderella, the audience would immediately be looking for a body in the coach." – Alfred Hitchcock|first=Teresa|last=Santoski|work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Nashua Telegraph]]|date=2012-08-13|accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Many psychological thrillers have emerged over the past years, all in various media (film, literature, radio, etc.). Despite these very different forms of representation, general trends have appeared throughout the narratives. Some of these consistent themes include:&lt;ref name=packer/&gt;

* [[Death]]
* [[Existence]]/[[Intention|Purpose]]
* [[Identity (philosophy)|Identity]]
* [[Mind]]
* [[Perception]]
* [[Reality]]

In psychological thrillers, characters often have to battle an inner struggle. Amnesia is a common [[plot device]] used to explore these questions. Character may be threatened with death, be forced to deal with the deaths of others, or fake their own deaths.&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; Psychological thrillers can be complex, and reviewers may recommend a second or third viewing to "decipher its secrets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Holden | date=2011-04-14 | work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/movies/the-double-hour-italian-thriller-review.html|title=Romance or Film Noir? Both, and a Thriller|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common elements may include [[stock character]]s, such as a [[Hardboiled|hardboiled detective]] and [[serial killer]], involved in a [[cat and mouse]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/07/31/your_psychological_thriller/ | title=Your Psychological Thriller | last=Wright | first=Chris|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=2011-07-31|accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sensation novel]]s, examples of early psychological thrillers, were considered to be socially irresponsible due to their themes of sex and violence. These novels, among others, were inspired by the exploits of real-life detective [[Jack Whicher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview29|title=The Prince of Sleuths|last=Summerscale|first=Kate|authorlink=Kate Summerscale|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-04-04|accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water, especially floods, is frequently used to represent the unconscious mind, such as in ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' and ''[[In Dreams (film)|In Dreams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Movies and the Mind|last=Indick|first=William|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] | year=2004 | isbn=9780786480920 | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU8B-6Bvb94C&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological thrillers may not always be concerned with plausibility. Peter Hutchings defines the [[giallo]], an Italian subgenre of psychological thrillers, as violent murder mysteries that focus on style and spectacle over rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The A to Z of Horror Cinema|last=Hutchings|first=Peter|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9780810870505|pages=141–143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC&amp;pg=PA141}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter B. Flint of ''[[The New York Times]]'', detractors of Alfred Hitchcock accused him of "relying on slick tricks, illogical story lines and wild coincidences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0813.html | title=Alfred Hitchcock Dies; A Master of Suspense|last=Flint|first=Peter B.|work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1980-04-30 | accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has been described as "an exercise in double-tracking one's public image: on the one hand, defining oneself through committed allegiance to a radical cause, but on the other, vitally, demonstrating this allegiance because it is the fashionable, ''[[:wiktionary:au courant|au courant]]'' way to be seen in moneyed, name-conscious Society."&lt;ref name=Molotov&gt;{{cite web |last=Bracewell |first=Michael |title=Molotov Cocktails |work=[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]] |date=November–December 2004 |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190439/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike dedicated [[Activism|activists]], [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]], or [[Political dissent|dissenters]], those who engage in "radical chic" remain frivolous political agitators. They are [[Ideology|ideologically]] invested in their cause of choice only so far as it advances their social standing.

"[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] chic" is a modern expression with similar connotations. This derivative, however, de-emphasizes the [[Social commentary|class satire]] of Wolfe's original term, instead accentuating concerns over the [[semiotics]] of radicalism (such as the [[aestheticization of violence]]).

In languages such as [[American English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] the term has become widely used to indicate people identifying themselves as [[Socialism|socialists]] or radical leftists while conducting upper-class lifestyles.

==Origin and meaning==
The phrase "radical chic" originated in a 1970 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' article by [[Tom Wolfe]], titled "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's",&lt;ref name="nymag1970"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/docs/07/05/070529radical_chic.pdf|title=Radical Chic: that Party at Lenny's|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|date=8 June 1970|work=New York|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later reprinted in his books ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]'' and ''[[The Purple Decades]]''. In the essay, Wolfe used the term to satirize composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] and his friends for their absurdity in hosting a fundraising party for the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]—an organization whose members, activities, and goals were clearly incongruous with those of Bernstein's elite circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foote |first=Timothy |title=Fish in the Brandy Snifter |date=1970-12-21 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904627,00.html? |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe's concept of radical chic was intended to lampoon individuals  (particularly [[Elitism|social elites]] like the [[jet set]]) who endorsed [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] radicalism merely to affect worldliness, assuage [[white guilt]], or garner prestige, rather than to affirm genuine political convictions.

{{Quote|[Wolfe's] subject is how culture's patrician classes – the wealthy, fashionable intimates of high society – have sought to luxuriate in both a vicarious glamour and a monopoly on virtue through their public espousal of street politics: a politics, moreover, of minorities so removed from their sphere of experience and so absurdly, diametrically, opposed to the islands of privilege on which the cultural aristocracy maintain their isolation, that the whole basis of their relationship is wildly out of kilter from the start. ... In short, Radical Chic is described as a form of highly developed decadence; and its greatest fear is to be seen not as prejudiced or unaware, but as middle-class.|Michael Bracewell|"Molotov Cocktails"&lt;ref name=Molotov /&gt;}}

==Background==
The concept of "fashionable" espousal of radical causes by members of wealthy society in this case had been argued against by Bernstein's wife, [[Felicia Montealegre]], prior to the publication of "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's", a fact Wolfe details in it. The essay appeared in the June 8, 1970 issue of ''New York'', 20 weeks after the actual fund raiser at the Bernstein residence was held on January 14. The first report of the event appeared the following day in a piece by ''[[The New York Times]]'' style reporter [[Charlotte Curtis]], who was in attendance. Curtis wrote in part: "Leonard Bernstein and a Black Panther leader argued the merits of the Black Panther party's philosophy before nearly 90 guests last night in the Bernsteins' elegant Park Avenue duplex." According to Wolfe, the release of the story worldwide was followed by strong criticism of the event: "The English, particularly, milked the story for all it was worth and seemed to derive one of the great cackles of the year from it."&lt;ref name=nymag1970 /&gt;

The negative reaction prompted publication of an op-ed in the ''Times'' on January 16 entitled "False Note on Black Panthers" that was severely critical of the Black Panther Party and Bernstein:

{{Quote|Emergence of the Black Panthers as the romanticized darlings of the politico-cultural jet set is an affront to the majority of black Americans. ... the group therapy plus fund-raising soiree at the home of Leonard Bernstein, as reported in this newspaper yesterday, represents the sort of elegant slumming that degrades patrons and patronized alike. It might be dismissed as guilt-relieving fun spiked with social consciousness, except for its impact on those blacks and whites seriously working for complete equality and social justice.&lt;ref name="nyt_false_note"&gt;{{cite news|title=False Note on Black Panthers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 16, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Felicia Montealegre wrote and personally delivered a response to this op-ed to the ''Times'' offices.&lt;ref name="nymag_html"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=Tom Wolfe on Radical Chic and Leonard Bernstein's Party for the Black Panthers|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index15.html|work=Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's|publisher=New York|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her response she wrote:

{{Quote|As a civil libertarian, I asked a number of people to my house on Jan. 14 in order to hear the lawyer and others involved with the Panther 21 discuss the problem of civil liberties as applicable to the men now waiting trial, and to help raise funds for their legal expenses. ... It was for this deeply serious purpose that our meeting was called. The frivolous way in which it was reported as a "fashionable" event is unworthy of the Times, and offensive to all people who are committed to humanitarian principles of justice.&lt;ref name=nymag_html /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_letter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Felicia M.|title=Letters to the Editor of The Times: Panthers' Legal Aid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html |accessdate=4 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terrorist chic==

'''Terrorist chic''' (also known as "terror chic" or "militant chic") is a more recent and specific variation of the term. It refers to the [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of symbols, objects, and aesthetics related to radical [[Militant (word)|militants]], usually in the context of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daly |first=Susan |title=Is the war over for terrorist chic? |work=[[Independent.ie]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=2008-11-08 |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/is-the-war-over-for-terrorist-chic-1528669.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herr |first=Cheryl |title=Terrorist Chic and Marching Season Style |work=[[The Vacuum]] |publisher=Factotum |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue17/is17artterchi.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such imagery is deployed [[Subversion (politics)|subversively]], the process exemplifies aestheticization of propaganda. Regardless, because terrorist chic derives its [[iconography]] from groups and individuals often associated with violent conflict or [[terrorism]], the term carries a greater pejorative tone than "radical chic."

Instances of terrorist chic have variously been interpreted as morally irresponsible, earnestly [[Counterculture|counter-cultural]], ironically [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], or benignly apolitical. According to Henry K. Miller of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the most well-known example is the ubiquitous appearance of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara in popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Henry K |title=Fatal attraction |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2002-10-28 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280033 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases that have been labeled terrorist chic include: the Prada-Meinhof fashion line (a pun on [[Prada]] and the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof Gang]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Connolly |first=Kate |title=Astrid Proll's journey to Terror Chic |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2002-10-06 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/06/germany.kateconnolly |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smiley |first=Shannon |title=Germany Debates 'Terrorist Chic': Art and Fashion Stir Memories of Leftist Violence in '70s |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=2005-02-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38447-2005Feb19.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion of combining [[keffiyeh]]s and military-style clothing such as camo prints and heavy boots, outside the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Daniel |title='Terrorist Chic' and Beyond |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=2006-04-09 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/09/magazine/tm-terrorchic15 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lando |first=Michal |title=US chain pulls 'anti-war' keffiyehs |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |publisher=Mirkaei Tikshoret Ltd. |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467767600&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |accessdate=2009-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Che embodied third world revolution, a drawing-room, radical-chic hope===

Noting the sustained interest in Che, Bernstein suggested that "the end of the cold war and the failure of the third-world revolution" allowed for the "scrutiny of Guevara, [as] a symbol of both the idealism and the [[moral blindness]] of the decade of protest" to take place free in a context free "of ideological partisanship and rancor."&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997 /&gt;

The film followed most other pop-culture trends by showing a glamorized and romanticized portrayal of Che as a 'heroic liberator'.&lt;ref name=chechiclatimes7ju2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TimeMagazine14june1999&gt;{{cite news|title=Che Guevarra: The Guerrilla|first=Ariel|last=Dorfman|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991268,00.html|date=14 June 1999|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro won the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]], and the film received mostly positive reviews.

'''Real time''' within the media is a method where events are portrayed at the same rate at which the characters experience them. For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. If a daily real-time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning. This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision. In some stories, every minute of screen time is a minute of fictional time. In other stories, such as the daily comic strip ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time.

Real time fiction dates back to the climactic structure of classical [[Greek drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://department.monm.edu/cata/rankin/classes/cata171/lectures/chapter15.htm  "Dramatic Structure: Climactic, Episodic, and Other Forms", Monmouth College, IL]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
Often, use of [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screens]] or [[picture-in-picture]]s are used to show events occurring at the same time, or the context in which various [[subplot]]s are affecting each other. Examples include the television series ''[[24 (television)|24]]'' and films ''[[Timecode (film)|Timecode]]'' and ''[[Phone Booth (film)|Phone Booth]]''. On-screen clocks are often used to remind the audience of the real-time presentation.

==Video games==
In a real-time computer game or simulation, events in the game occur at the same rate as the events which are being depicted. For instance, in a real-time combat game, in one hour of play the game depicts one hour of combat.

*''[[Night Trap]]''
*''[[The Last Express]]''
*''[[24: The Game]]''
*''[[Titanic: Adventure Out of Time]]

==Comic books and strips==
In [[comic books]], the use of real time is made more complicated by the fact that most serial comics are released on a monthly basis and are traditionally 20 to 30 pages long, making it difficult to tell a story set in real time without overlooking important events from one month to the next. Another explanation is the prevalence of the [[super-hero]] genre in American comics, and the [[iconic]] status attached to such characters : it is often considered that such mythological, sometimes godlike heroes cannot age in real time without losing the characteristics that make them special. Hence the more common use of [[floating timeline]]s in [[Marvel Comics]] or [[DC Comics]]. Exceptions include [[Marvel Comics]]' [[New Universe]] line of books, [[Erik Larsen]]'s long-running ''[[Savage Dragon]]'' ongoing series, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s ''[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]'' (three non-canon miniseries exploring the notion of "what if Superman and Batman could age?"), and [[Ben Dunn]]'s ''[[Ninja High School]]''.

Comic strips which feature characters aging in real-time include:

* ''[[Ninja High School]]''
* ''[[Hellblazer]]'' John Constantine's events take place within an "active continuity".
* ''[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]''
* ''[[Savage Dragon]]''
* ''[[New Universe]]'' (Marvel Comics imprint, 1986–1989)
* ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' A weekly comic book series by [[DC Comics]]
* ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' (Characters have aged in real-time since the series started in 1977)
* ''[[Gasoline Alley]]'' (Characters have grown up, aged and died in real time since the 1920s)
* ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'' (for its first 28 years of existence)
* ''[[Doonesbury]]'' (Characters age in real-time and interact with real history)
* ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]''

==Novels==
In the [[Inspector Rebus]] series of detective novels (17 as of 2010) by the Scottish writer [[Ian Rankin]], characters age in step with the publication date. Rebus is stated to have been born in 1947; in the 2007 novel ''[[Exit Music]]'' he reached 60, and retired.

The [[Mandie]] series of children's mystery novels by [[Lois Gladys Leppard]] are exactly one hundred years from the present real time and ended by the eighteenth year (or one hundred and eighteenth year) of the main protagonist in 2006 at the reader's end of childhood and adolescence.

In ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' the entire story takes place in real time.

The '''Republican Generation''' is an identified generational cohort within the [[Strauss Howe generational theory]], born between 1742 and 1766.

This generation is known for participating in several global revolutionary movements during the [[Age of Revolution]]. 

This generation witnessed political turmoil in response to growing [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and the vast [[Social inequality|social inequalities]] exacerbated by ruthless competition between European Monarchists.

They came of age during British imperialism and during a time when the viability of [[mercantilism]] was being questioned.

Relying on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophy]], they unleashed violent episodes of revolution, vilified Monarchy, and promoted [[Republicanism]].

In [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]], they participated in the [[American Revolutionary War]], secured Independence from British rule, and established a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] system of governance, based on [[Federal republic|constitutional republicanism]] and [[representative democracy]].

==Notable Persons==

Notable persons affiliated with this generation include [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], [[Maximilien Robespierre]], and [[Camille Desmoulins]].

'''Sophistication''' has come to mean a few things, but its original definition was "to denature, or simplify". Today it is common as a measure of refinement—displaying [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], [[wisdom]] and subtlety rather than crudeness, [[stupidity]] and [[vulgarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OjwEQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Sophistication |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History |author=Faye Hammill|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the perception of [[social class]], sophistication can be linked with concepts such as [[social status|status]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] and [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;

== Scope of sophistication ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In social terms, the connotations of sophistication depends on whether one is an insider or an outsider of the sophisticated class.  Sophistication can be seen as "a form of snobbery," or as "among the most desirable of human qualities."&lt;ref&gt;

A study of style conveys an idea of the range of possible elements through which one can demonstrate sophistication in [[elegance]] and [[fashion]], covering the art of "[...] the shoemaker, the hairdresser, the cosmetologist, the cookbook writers, the chef, the diamond merchant, the couturieres, and the fashion queens, the inventors of the folding umbrella ... and of champagne."&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], ''sophia'' was the special [[insight]] of [[poet]]s and [[prophet]]s.  This then became the wisdom of [[philosophers]] such as [[sophists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sophistication |author=Mark Backman |chapter=The Roots of Our Sophistication |isbn=978-0-918024-91-6 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But their use of [[rhetoric]] to win arguments gave sophistication a derogatory quality. Sophistry was then the art of misleading.

The system of modern Western sophistication has its roots in France, arguably helped along its way by the policies of King [[Louis XIV]] (reigned 1643–1715).&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last       = DeJean
| first      = Joan
| title         = The essence of style: how the French invented high fashion, fine food, chic cafes, style, sophistication, and glamour
| year      = 2003
| publisher = Free Press
| location  = New York
| isbn      = 978-0-7432-6413-6
| page      = 3
| quote         = In the sixteenth century, the French were not thought of as the most elegant or the most sophisticated European nation. By the early eighteenth century, however, people all over Europe declared that 'the French are stylish' or 'the French know good food,' just as they said, 'the Dutch are clean.' France had acquired a sort of monopoly on culture, style, and luxury living, a position that it has occupied ever since. [...] Beginning in the late seventeenth century, travelers were saying what novelists and filmmakers are still repeating: travel to Paris was guaranteed to add a touch of magic to every life. [...] [F]rom this moment on, that touch of magic became widely desired: elegance, luxury, and sophistication became factors to be reckoned with.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The English regarded sophistication as decadent and deceptive until the aristocratic [[sensibility|sensibilities]] and refined elegance of Regency [[dandy|dandies]] such as [[Beau Brummell]] (1778–1840) became fashionable and admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=413279&amp;sectioncode=26 |journal=[[Times Higher Education]] |author=Deborah Longworth |date=2 Sep 2010 |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of sophistication ==

Recognised varieties of sophistication include:

* cultural sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:
{{cite book
| last       = Holt
| first      =  Douglas
|author2=Douglas Cameron
 | title         = Cultural Strategy: Using Innovative Ideologies to Build Breakthrough Brands

| year      = 2010
| publisher = Oxford University Press
| isbn      = 0-19-958740-X
| pages      = 91–92
| quote         = The pursuit of cultural sophistication (Bourdieu's cultural capital) was until recently a niche phenomenon in America. It existed mainly in 'old-money' families, which dominated elite breeding grounds (prep schools, Ivy league universities, elite liberal arts colleges), and in the small Bohemian circles in the country's biggest cities. [...] The transformation of the American class dynamic from a single-minded striving for economic abundance to a multi-dimensional striving for sophistication in addition to abundance – a mixture of status pursuits more typical of Europe – was seeded in the 1960s.                   = adam markovich
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;(or culturedness)
* intellectual sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:{{cite book
| last       = Hodgson
| first      = Marshall G. S
| authorlink = Marshall Hodgson
| title         = The venture of Islam: conscience and history in a world civilization

| page      = 323
| quote         = But the mutakallim's universe of discourse now included the whole range of Falsafah with its intellectual sophistication.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the analysis of [[humor]], [[Victor Raskin]] distinguishes "two types of sophistication: limited access, or allusive knowledge, and complex processing".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last       = Attardo
| first      = Salvatore

| publisher = Walter de Gruyter
| isbn      = 978-3-11-014255-6
| page      = 216
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquiring sophistication ==

Methods of acquiring the appearance of personal sophistication include:

* educational travel – note the function of the traditional [[Grand Tour]] for European aesthetes&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last       = Warneke
| first      = Sara

| year      = 1995
| publisher = Brill
| isbn      = 978-90-04-10126-5
| page      = 242
| quote         = By the second half of the seventeenth century the experience of the Grand Tour marked the socially successful gentleman. In 1678 Gailhard noted that many travelled Englishmen regarded their home-bred compatriots as their social inferiors and affected foreign accents, fashions and mannerisms in order to demonstrate their sophistication.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Finishing school]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| last1        = Mackintosh
| first1       = Prudence
|date=January 1986
| title        = Little Women

&lt;/ref&gt;

On a societal level commentators can associate various forms of sophistication with [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Comic balloons 4 types 1x4.svg|thumb|The four most common speech balloons, top to bottom: speech, whisper, thought, scream.]]

'''Speech balloons''' (also '''speech bubbles''', '''dialogue balloons''' or '''word balloons''') are a graphic convention used most commonly in [[comic book]]s, [[comic]]s and [[cartoon]]s to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing the speech or thoughts of a given character in the comic. There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a '''thought bubble'''.

==History==

One of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the "[[speech scroll]]s", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in [[Mesoamerican]] art between 600 and 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper| author=Hull, Kerry Michael| title=Verbal Art and Performance in Ch’orti’ and Maya Hieroglyphic Writing| year=2003| url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012021647/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2003/hullkm039/hullkm039.pdf| archivedate=2006-10-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as "banderoles") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the [[American Revolution]] (including some published by [[Benjamin Franklin]]) often used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/erelrev.htm|title=Religion and the American Revolution, Divining America, TeacherServe®, National Humanities Center|work=rtp.nc.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/wood/ykid/illustrated.htm The Yellow Kid on paper and stage, Contemporary illustrations]''. Retrieved October 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation.&lt;ref name=ArtOfCaricature&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofcaricature00wrig#page/134/mode/2up/ The Art of Caricature], p. 134, by Grant Wright; published September 1904, by Baker &amp; Taylor Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the [[comics]] industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.

[[Richard F. Outcault]]'s [[Yellow Kid]] is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' and the early [[Tarzan (comics)|''Tarzan'' comic strip]] in the 1930s. In Europe, where [[text comics]] were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like [[Alain Saint-Ogan]]'s ''[[Zig et Puce]]'' (1925), [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' (1929)  and [[Rob-Vel]]'s ''[[Spirou (comics)|Spirou]]'' (1938).

==Popular forms==

===Speech bubbles===
The most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.

When one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in [[Mad Magazine]], due to its "[[call-and-response]]" dialogue-based humor.

An off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being "off screen") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in [[manga]], has the tail pointing ''into'' the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of [[Marjane Satrapi]] (author of ''[[Persepolis (graphic novel)|Persepolis]]'').

In American &lt;!--- Is the description American necessary? Isn't this technique also used in manga, etc? ---&gt; comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the [[point of view (literature)|viewpoint character]], often as an unspecified member of a crowd.

Characters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to [[voice-over]] in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast.  In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or [[quotation mark]]s.

===Thought bubbles===
Thought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the "fuzzy" bubble.

The chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, [[cloud]]-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.

Often animal characters like [[Snoopy]] and [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] "talk" using thought bubbles.  Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.

Another, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the "fuzzy" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as [[Ken Akamatsu]]), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.

Writers and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.

===Other forms===
The shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:
*''Scream bubbles'' indicate a character is screaming or shouting, usually with a jagged outline or a thicker line which can be colored.  Their lettering is usually larger or bolder than normal.
*''Broadcast bubbles'' (also known as ''radio bubbles'') may have a jagged tail like the conventional drawing of a lightning flash and either a squared-off or jagged outline. Letters are sometimes italicised without also being bold. Broadcast bubbles indicate that the speaker is communicating through an electronic device, such as a radio or television, or is robotic.
*''Whisper bubbles'' are usually drawn with a dashed (dotted) outline, smaller font or gray lettering to indicate the tone is softer, as most speech is printed in black. &lt;BR&gt;Another form, sometimes encountered in manga, looks like an occidental thought bubble.
*''Icicle bubbles'' have jagged "icicles" on the lower edge, representing "cold" hostility.  
*''Monster bubbles'' have blood or slime dripping from them.
*''Colored bubbles'' can be used to convey the emotion that goes with the speech, such as red for anger or green for envy. This style is seldom used in modern comics. Alternatively (especially in online-published comics), colours can be used to provide an additional cue about who is speaking. Main characters often have individual thematic colours, and their speech bubbles are frequently tinted with their colour; especially in situations when there are no characters visible for speech bubbles to point to.

==Captions==
Captions are generally used for [[narration]] purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.&lt;ref name=Piekos&gt;Piekos, Nate. [http://www.blambot.com/articles_grammar.shtml "Comic Book Grammar &amp; Tradition" (Updated 2015)], Blambot website. Accessed Jan. 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist-specific variations==
[[Image:YellowKid.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Yellow Kid]]'s words appear on his shirt]]

Some characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the [[Yellow Kid]], an early [[United States|American]] [[comic strip]]. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run [[Shirt Tales#TV series|American animated TV series of the early 1980s]] used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the "T-shirts" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. 

Also noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by [[Dave Sim]] for his comic ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]''. Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.

An early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was [[Walt Kelly]], in his ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in [[blackletter]], P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, "Mr. Pig" (a take on [[Nikita Khrushchev]]) speaks in [[faux Cyrillic]], etc.

In the famous French comic series ''[[Asterix]]'', [[René Goscinny|Goscinny]] and [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]] use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in [[blackletter]], Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with "Nørdic åccents", Egyptians in faux [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''. The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.

Font variation is a common tactic in comics. ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' series, written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Letterer|lettered]] by [[Todd Klein]], features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]], speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven [[Characters of The Sandman#Matthew|Matthew]] speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|title= Comics You Should Own – ''Sandman''|first= Greg|last= Burgas|date= January 7, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140410022316/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/01/07/comics-you-should-own-sandman/|archivedate= April 10, 2014|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'''s recurring ''[[Monroe (comic strip)|Monroe]]'' comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.

In [[manga]], there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice.  [[Characters of Negima (16-31)#Satsuki Yotsuba|Satsuki Yotsuba]] in the manga series [[Negima]] is notable because she speaks almost ''entirely'' in side scribble.

==Graphic symbols==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Speech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.

===Punctuation marks===
One of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big [[question mark]] (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An [[exclamation mark]] (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.

In [[manga]], the [[ellipsis]] (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the [[Japan]]ese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition.  Japanese even has a sound effect for "deafening silence", {{nihongo|''shiin''|シーン|}}.

===Foreign languages===
In many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by [[Brackets|angle brackets]] or chevrons {{angbr|like this}}.

[[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s series about [[Love and Rockets (comics)|Palomar]] is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a [[Hispanic]] country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main [[Hispanophone]] characters in the series.

Some comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in ''Asterix''.

Another convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, [[Asterix and the Goths|''Asterix''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Goths]] speak in [[blackletter]].

Since the Japanese language uses [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two writing directionalities]] (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.

===The big Z===
It is a convention in [[United States|American]] comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to [[Rudolph Dirks]]' early 20th-century strip ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Cecil. [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/42997/why-does-z-stand-for-snoring-and-how-do-other/ "The Straight Dope: Why Does Z Stand for Snoring? And how do other languages represent the sound?,"] ''Washington City Paper'' (July 27, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strips.

Originally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the [[English language]], but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries.  An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Megan. [https://www.wired.com/2015/05/using-emoji-wrong/ "WE’RE ALL USING THESE EMOJI WRONG,"] ''Wired'' (05.21.15).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawings within the speech bubble===
Singing characters usually have [[musical note]]s drawn into their word balloons. [[Archie Comics]]' [[Melody Valentine]], a character in their ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.

The above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the ''Asterix'' series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually  preceding a violent outburst by the same character).

A stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.

[[Light bulbs]] are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.

In the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&amp;%$@*$#), sometimes called [[The Lexicon of Comicana|grawlixes]]. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is [[censorship|censored]] by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.

One example is the [[Spain|Spanish]] ''[[Mortadelo]]'' series, created by [[Francisco Ibáñez Talavera|Francisco Ibáñez]]. Although not specifically addressed to children, ''Mortadelo'' was born during [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[dictatorship]], when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.

When ''Mortadelo'' was portrayed on film by Spanish director [[Javier Fesser]] in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: "When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?"

==Order==
In order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in [[English language|English]], the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are "stacked", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.

==Lettering==
Traditionally, a cartoonist or occupational [[letterer]] would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand.  A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs.  The [[font]]s used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.

Traditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in [[upper-case]], with a few exceptions:
* Name particles such as ''de'' and ''von'', and the "c" in a [[surname]] of Scottish or Irish origin starting with ''Mc''
* To indicate a frightened or quiet manner of speech
* An interjection such as "er", "um", etc.

When hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, Drew. [http://multiversitycomics.com/columns/looking-at-lettering-caps-vs-mixed-case/ "Looking at Lettering: CAPS vs Mixed Case,"] ''Multiversity Comics'' (April 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing.  Since the mid-1980s, [[mixed case]] lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).

From 2002–2004, [[Marvel Comics]] experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.

In many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, [[serif]] versions of "I" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a [[sanserif]] (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun "I" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as [[Blambot]]'s "DigitalStrip.ttf" and "AnimeAce.ttf" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.

==Substance of balloons==
In several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous [[meta-]]like purposes. In ''[[Peanuts]]'', for example, the notes played by [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip ''[[Sturmtruppen]]'' they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an [[Archie (comics)|Archie]] comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.

In the Flemish ''[[Suske en Wiske]]'' series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the [[pensieve]] in the [[Harry Potter]] series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at [[supersonic]] speed.

In the novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]'', the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.

==Computer-generated speech balloons==
Many digital artists generate speech balloons with [[List of vector graphics editors|general-purpose illustration software]].  Products like [[Comic Book Creator]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Comic Life]] for [[Mac OS X]] and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.

[[File:Hans Rottenhammer - Allegory of the Arts - WGA20147.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Rottenhammer]], ''Allegory of the Arts'' (second half of the 16th century). [[Gemäldegalerie]], Berlin.]]

'''The arts''' refers to the [[Aesthetics|theory]] and [[Art|physical expression]] of [[creativity]] found in human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s. Major constituents of the arts include [[literature]] (including [[drama]], [[poetry]], and [[prose]]), [[performing arts]] (among them [[dance]], [[music]], and [[theatre]]), and [[visual arts]] (including [[architecture]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[sculpting]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g., [[cinematography]]) or artwork with  the written word (e.g., [[comics]]). From prehistoric [[cave paintings]] to modern day [[films]], art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Definitions==
In its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is "good" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines "the arts" as "painting, sculpture, music, theatre, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20arts|title=Definition of The Arts|work=Merriam-Webster|language=en|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Congress]], in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined "the arts" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/361_r8.html|title=Congressional definition of "the arts"|last=Van Camp|first=Julie|date=22 November 2006|website=PHIL 361I: Philosophy of Art|publisher=California State University, Long Beach|language=en|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The term 'the arts' includes, but is not limited to, music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, architecture and allied fields, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic and craft arts, industrial design, costume and fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, film, video, tape and sound recording, the arts related to the presentation, performance, execution, and exhibition of such major art forms, all those traditional arts practiced by the diverse peoples of this country. (sic) and the study and application of the arts to the human environment.}}

==History==
{{main article|History of art}}

In [[Ancient Greece]], all art and craft was referred to by the same word, ''[[techne]]''. Thus, there was no distinction among the arts. [[Ancient Greek]] art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt). In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. [[Eastern art]] has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of [[Indian art|India]], [[Tibetan art|Tibet]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]]. Religious [[Islamic art|Islamic]] art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.

In modern [[academia]], the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the [[humanities]]. Some subjects in the humanities are [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and [[logic]].

The arts have also been classified as seven: [[painting]], [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[performing]] and [[Film|cinema]].
Some view literature, painting, sculpture, and music as the main four arts, of which the others are derivative; [[drama]] is literature with [[acting]], [[dance]] is music expressed through [[Motion (physics)|motion]], and [[song]] is music with literature and [[Human voice|voice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/Esthetics_Main.html|title=Esthetics|last=Rowlands|first=Joseph|last2=Landauer|first2=Jeff|date=2001|website=Importance of Philosophy|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] on top of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]]]]

Architecture is the [[art]] and [[science]] of [[design]]ing [[building]]s and [[structure]]s. The word ''architecture'' comes from the Greek ''arkhitekton'', "master builder, director of works," from ''αρχι-'' (arkhi) "chief" + ''τεκτων'' (tekton) "builder, carpenter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=architect (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of [[town planning]], [[urban design]], and [[landscape architecture]] to the microlevel of creating [[furniture]]. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and [[cost]] for the [[Construction|builder]], as well as function and [[aesthetics]] for the [[Consumer|user]].

[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

In modern usage, architecture is the [[art]] and [[discipline]] of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or [[system]]. The term can be used to connote the ''implied architecture'' of abstract things such as [[music]] or [[mathematics]], the ''apparent architecture'' of natural things, such as [[geology|geological]] formations or the [[structural biology|structure of biological cells]], or explicitly ''planned architectures'' of human-made things such as [[software]], [[computers]], [[Enterprise architecture|enterprises]], and [[database]]s, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a ''subjective [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'' from a human perspective (that of the ''user'' in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] or components of some kind of [[structure]] or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing [[aesthetics]]. This distinguishes it from [[applied science]] or [[engineering]], which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.

In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a [[hospital]] or a [[stadium]], to the apparently simpler, such as planning [[residential]] houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political [[symbol]]s, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.

=== Ceramics ===
{{Main article|Ceramic art}}

Ceramic art is art made from [[ceramic]] materials (including [[clay]]), which may take forms such as [[pottery]], [[tile]], [[figurine]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[tableware]]. While some ceramic products are considered [[fine art]], some are considered to be [[Decorative arts|decorative]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], or [[Applied arts|applied]] art objects. Ceramics may also be considered [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] in [[archaeology]].Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery." In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce [[studio pottery]]. In modern ceramic engineering usage, "ceramics" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes [[glass]] and [[mosaic]] made from glass ''[[tessera]]e.''

===Conceptual art===
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}

Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/conceptual-art|title=Conceptual art|publisher=Tate|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practise the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].

===Drawing===
{{Main article|Drawing}}

Drawing is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[Pen|pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil|colour pencils]], [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An [[artist]] who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''drafter'', ''draftswoman'', or ''draughtsman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/draftsman|title=The definition of draftsman|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as [[illustration]]s, [[comics]] and [[animation]].

===Painting===
{{Main article|Painting}}

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]

Painting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. [[Drawing]], [[gesture]] (as in [[gestural painting]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[narrative|narration]] (as in [[narrative art]]), or [[abstraction]] (as in [[abstract art]]), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=Lincoln|title=The Music of Painting|journal=The American Scholar|date=Summer 2014|volume=83|issue=3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a [[still life]] or [[landscape art|landscape painting]]), [[Photorealism|photographic]], abstract, narrative, [[symbol]]istic (as in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist art]]), [[emotion|emotive]] (as in [[Expressionism]]), or [[Politics|political]] in nature (as in [[Artivism]]).

Modern painters have extended the practice considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. Collage is not painting in the strict sense since it includes other materials. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]], [[wood]] or strands of hair for their [[Texture (painting)|artwork texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Elito Circa]], [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]].

===Photography===
{{Main article|Fine art photography}}

Photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to [[photojournalism]], which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.

===Sculpture===
{{Main article|Sculpture}}

'''Sculpture''' is the branch of the [[visual arts]] that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the [[plastic arts]]. Durable sculptural processes originally used [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in [[stone]], [[metal]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood]] and other materials; but since [[modernism]], shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by [[welding]] or modelling, or [[Molding (process)|moulded]], or [[Casting|cast]].

==Literary arts==
{{Main article|Language|Literature}}
{{Listen|filename=Sonnet18.ogg|title=Sonnet 18|description= '''''[[Sonnet 18]]''''' by [[William Shakespeare]] part of the Fair Youth [[Sonnet sequence|sequence]] of [[sonnet]]s.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Literature is literally "acquaintance with letters" as in the first sense given in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The noun "literature" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''littera'' meaning "an individual written character ([[Letter (alphabet)|letter]])." The term has generally come to identify a collection of [[writing]]s, which in Western culture are mainly [[prose]] (both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]), [[drama]] and [[poetry]]. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be [[oral literature|oral]] as well, and include such [[genre]]s as [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[legend]], [[Mythology|myth]], [[ballad]], other forms of oral [[poetry]], and as [[Folklore|folktale]]. [[Comics]], the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the "[[ninth art]]" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading bande dessinée : critical approaches to French-language comic strip|last=Miller|first=Ann|year=2007|isbn=9781841501772|oclc=939254581|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==
{{Main article|Performing arts}}

Performing arts comprise [[dance]], [[music]], [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[mime]], and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford companion to philosophy|last=Honderich|first=Ted|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|isbn=9780199264797|oclc=180031201|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called ''performers'', including [[actor]]s, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;with tools such as [[costume]] and [[Theatrical makeup|stage makeup]].

===Music===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:MozartExcerptK331.svg|thumb|A musical score by [[Mozart]]. {{audio|MozartExcerptK331.mid|Play}}]]

Music is an art form whose [[Media (arts)|medium]] is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs melody and harmony), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]]. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric pieces]]. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within "the arts," music may be classified as a [[performing art]], a [[fine art]], and [[auditory art]].

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}

Theatre or theater (from Greek ''theatron'' (''θέατρον)''; from ''theasthai'', "behold")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=theater&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=theater (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle – indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]] and [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]].

===Dance===
[[File:Ballroom dance exhibition.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[ballroom]] dance exhibition]]
{{Main article|Dance}}

[[Dance]] (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', of unknown origin)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dance&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=dance (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally refers to human [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of expression or presented in a [[social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. ''Dance'' is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s (e.g. [[Bee Dance language|bee dance]], [[Courtship display|mating dance]]), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (e.g. ''the leaves danced in the wind''), and certain [[dance (music)|musical forms]] or [[music|genres]]. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. In [[sport]]s, [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are dance disciplines while [[Martial arts]] "[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]" are often compared to dances.

==Multidisciplinary artistic works==
Areas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as [[film]], [[opera]] and [[Performance Art|performance art]]. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for "works", because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional [[opera]], the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music). [[File:Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute.png|thumb|left|Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute]]The composer [[Richard Wagner]] recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' ("The Ring of the Nibelung"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("synthesis of the arts"), sometimes referred to as "Music Drama" in [[English language|English]], emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical [[ballet]] is another form which emerged in the 17th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.

Other works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as [[Performance Art|performance art]]. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. [[John Cage]] is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition ''[[Living Room Music]]'' composed in 1940 is a "quartet" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.

==Other arts==
There is no clear line between art and [[culture]].  Cultural fields like [[gastronomy]] are sometimes considered as arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/new-face-french-gastronomy/ |title=The New Face of French Gastronomy - Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied arts===
{{Main article|Applied arts}}
The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;"applied art" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. www.oxfordreference.com. Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/applied-art |title=Applied art &amp;#124; Define Applied art at |publisher=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "applied art" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.

===Video games===
{{See also|Video games as an art form}}
A debate exists in the fine arts and [[video game culture]]s over whether video games can be counted as an art form.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=12 December 2012|title=An Art World for Artgames|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/viewArticle/119|last=Parker|first=Felan|journal=Loading...|language=en|volume=7|issue=11|issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators – not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets.

Within social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.&lt;ref name="video-games-and-arts"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=Video Games Playing: A substitute for cultural consumptions?|last1=Borowiecki|first1=Karol J.|last2=Prieto-Rodriguez|first2=Juan|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=239–258|doi=10.1007/s10824-014-9229-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.676.2381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a "work of art" when applying of a grant.{{fact|date=October 2018}} In 2012, the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] presented an exhibit, ''The Art of the Video Game''.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames" /&gt; Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.

{{for|the class of words|Profanity}}
'''Vulgarity''' is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined.  This judgement may refer to [[language]], [[visual art]], [[social class]]es, or [[social climber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bayley claims it can never be [[self-referential]] because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of [[sophistication]] which thereby elevates the subject above the [[:wikt:vulgar|vulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/4/298 |title=Vulgarity |author=John Bayley |journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1964 |volume=4 |pages=298–304 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/4.4.298 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, "vulgar" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country.  From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: "having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred".  In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior.  In a [[George Eliot]] novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|pages=1–10|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words.  In [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Beauchamp's Career]]'', an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is "engaged", nor "betrothed", "affianced", or "plighted".  Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as ''[[toilet]]'' eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of "[[cultural capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|page=17|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Vulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or [[Obscenity|obscene]], [[synonym]]ous with the 'general' meaning of [[profanity]].

The word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is "cursing." However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, "Cursing in America" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the "dirty words" because it "allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered  taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is ''fuck''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomquist, Robert F. "The F-Word: A Jurisprudential Taxonomy of American Morals (In a Nutshell)." Santa Clara L. Rev. 40 (1999): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cursing ===
Curse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
Religious curses may include "Damn you", "God damn you", "To hell with you". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like "Fuck you" or "Eat shit and die".

=== Profanity ===
Profanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. 

For a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6525">"'''Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?'''" is a 1971 essay by American art historian [[Linda Nochlin]]. It is considered a pioneering essay for both [[art history#Feminist Art History|feminist art history]] and [[feminist art theory]].&lt;ref name="rijsingen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rijsingen|first=Miriam van|editor=Rosemarie Buikema, Anneke Smeli|title=Women's Studies and Culture: A Feminist Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztJ0vUysZCQC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1995|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781856493123|pages=94–105|chapter=How purple can it be?: Feminist art history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In this essay, Nochlin explores the institutional – as opposed to the individual – obstacles that have prevented women in the West from succeeding in the arts. She divides her argument into several sections, the first of which takes on the assumptions implicit in the essay's title, followed by "The Question of the Nude," "The Lady's Accomplishment," "Successes," and "[[Rosa Bonheur]]." In her introduction, she acknowledges "the recent upsurge of feminist activity" in America as a condition for her interrogation of the ideological foundations of [[art history]], while also invoking [[John Stuart Mill]]'s suggestion that "we tend to accept whatever ''is'' as natural".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Women, Art and Power &amp; Other Essays.|date=1988|publisher=HARPER COLLINS (PA)|location=United States|isbn=0064301834|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her conclusion, she states: "I have tried to deal with one of the perennial questions used to challenge women's demand for true, rather than token, equality by examining the whole erroneous intellectual substructure upon which the question "Why have there been no great women artists?" is based; by questioning the validity of the formulation of so-called problems in general and the "problem" of women specifically; and then, by probing some of the limitations of the discipline of art history itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Women, Art and Power and Other Essays.|date=1988|publisher=HARPER COLLINS (PA)|location=United States|isbn=0064301834|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history and legacy==
First published in 1971 as "Why Are There No Great Women Artists?" in ''Woman in Sexist Society: Studies in Power and Powerlessness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gornick|editor1-first=Vivian|editorlink=Vivian Gornick|editor2-last=Moran|editor2-first=Barbara|title=Woman in Sexist Society: Studies in Power and Powerlessness|chapter=Why Are There No Great Women Artists?|last=Nochlin|first=Linda|location=New York|publisher=Basic Books|date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nochlin's essay was revised, retitled "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?" and published in ''[[ArtNews]]''. It was also released with other essays and photographs in ''Art and Sexual Politics: Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hess|editor1-first=Thomas B.|editor2-last=Baker|editor2-first=Elizabeth C.|title=Art and Sexual Politics: Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mothersill"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mothersill|first=Mary|year=1974|title=Review of Hess and Baker, ''Art and Sexual Politics: Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?''|journal=[[The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism]]|volume=32|issue=3|pages=435–36|jstor=428436|doi=10.2307/428436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leighninger, Jr.|first=Robert D.|year=1977|title=Review of Hess and Baker, ''Art and Sexual Politics: Why Have There been No Great Women Artists?''|journal=[[Contemporary Sociology]]|volume=6|issue=3|pages=303–4|jstor=2064782|doi=10.2307/2064782}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay has been reprinted regularly since then, including in Nochlin's ''Women, Art, and Power and Other Essays''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Women, Art and Power and Other Essays.|date=1988|publisher=HARPER COLLINS (PA)|location=United States|isbn=0064301834}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Women Artists: The Linda Nochlin Reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Nochlin|editor1-first=Linda|editor2-last=Reilly|editor2-first=Maura|title=Women Artists: The Linda Nochlin Reader|location=New York|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?" is generally considered required reading for the fields of [[art history#Feminist Art History|feminist art history]] and [[feminist art theory]] inasmuch as it calls out the institutional barriers to the visual arts that women in the Western tradition historically faced. Nochlin considers the history of women's art education as well as the nature of art and of artistic [[genius]]. The essay has also served as an important impetus for the rediscovery of [[women artists]], followed as it was by the exhibition ''[[Women Artists: 1550-1950]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Florence|year=1977|title=Editorial|journal=[[Women's Studies Newsletter]]|volume=5|issue=4|page=2|jstor=40042534 .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleanor Munro called it "epochal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro|first=Eleanor C.|authorlink=Eleanor Munro|title=Originals: American Women Artists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmexC6OiYusC&amp;pg=PA531|year=2000|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=9780306809552|pages=7, 531}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Miriam van Rijsingen]] "it is considered the genesis of feminist art history".&lt;ref name="rijsingen"/&gt;

The essay's title and content have inspired a number of essays and publications about the absence of women in certain professional fields, such as "Why Are There No Great Women Chefs?" by Charlotte Druckman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Druckman|first=Charlotte|year=2010|title=Why Are There No Great Women Chefs?|journal=Gastronomica|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–31|jstor=10.1525/gfc.2010.10.1.24|doi=10.1525/gfc.2010.10.1.24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 an exhibition was held to increase visibility for women artists entitled Women's Work: the Montana Women's Centennial Art Survey Exhibition 1889-1989 inspired by Nochlin's groundbreaking contribution.

The '''William Phelps Ornithological Collection,''' also known as the Phelps Ornithological Museum, is a museum of [[Natural science|natural sciences]] dedicated to the study, exhibition and preservation of the [[Bird|birds]] of [[Venezuela]] and the rest of Latin America. The collection is located east of Caracas and in the geographic center of [[Metropolitan Region of Caracas|Greater Caracas]], in the heart of the [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande district]]. The William Phelps ornithological collection is the most important in [[Latin America]] and it is also the most important private collection in the world in its research area.&lt;ref name=":282"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this private museum one will find important Phelps family study books, as well as 8000 scientific volumes in the library,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|author=Marcos Kirschstein y José Daniel Ramos|title=El bulevar de Sabana Grande esconde un misterio de ochenta años|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/videos/cultura/bulevar-sabana-grande-esconde-misterio-ochenta-anos_69876|date=2018-01-29|accessdate=2018-05-29|work=El Nacional|location=|page=|number=|Apellido 2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 83,000 anatomical specimens, more than 80,000 skins, etc.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;  For the year 1990, it was said that the William Phelps Ornithological Collection contained more than 76,300 skins and a small number of anatomical specimens, in the Gran Sabana Building of [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande]]. The Phelps library in 1990 already had 6,000 books, 800 journals and 5,500 reprints, mostly from natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;
 
== History ==

The ornithological collection was born in 1938, although it did not have its own headquarters on the [[Boulevard of Sabana Grande]] until 1949. At the beginning of 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the passing of time, the collection has been growing&lt;ref name=":282" /&gt; and still has great international scientific relevance. In 2005, an investigation was carried out on "plumage differences in four subspecies of golden warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in [[Venezuela]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.neotropicalbirdclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C23-Restall.pdf|title=On plumage differences in four subspecies of Golden-crowned Warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in Venezuela|last=Restall|first=Robin|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Gustavo|date=2005|journal=Cotinga|number=23|pages=33–36|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=|last3=Lentino|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Importance ===
The Phelps Foundation has been recognized worldwide for its scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fundacionwhphelps.org/web/nosotros/|title=Nosotros – Colección Ornitológica Phelps|website=fundacionwhphelps.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937, this foundation has dedicated to the study of the distribution of birds in Venezuela as well as to the dissemination of ornithology in Venezuela. Since 1949, it has expanded globally in its mission to discover, interpret and disseminate information about ornithology through a program of scientific research, education and dissemination in the natural sciences. The Foundation has had an important global trajectory for which it is recognized and is a regional compulsory study resource on tropical birds for experts who want to know more about this area. This museum has historically been connected to the American Museum of Natural History, thanks to the work of Billy Phelps.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithological collection has also been expanded thanks to the research carried out with Armando Dugand from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/33067/1/32820-121526-1-PB.pdf|title=AVES DE LA RIBERA COLOMBIANA DEL RIO NEGRO (FRONTERA DE COLOMBIA Y VENEZUELA)|last=Dugand|first=Armando|last2=Phelps|first2=William|authorlink2=|date=1948|journal=Libro|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds to carry out these investigations were collected by the Phelps Foundation.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

=== Research ===
In March and April 1977, the Phelps Ornithological Collection, with the collaboration of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Border Commission, Demarcador de Limites, carried out a collection of birds at Cerro Urutaní (62 ° 05'W, 3 ° 40'N), which is a low altitude tepui on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border in the Sierra Pacaraima. A total of 511 specimens of birds were collected between 1150 and 1280 meters high s.n.m., representing 78 different species. Gilberto Pérez Chinchilla, Manuel Castro and Dickerman prepared the copies of the collection. A full report on these birds was published in the international press and was published in the Bulletin of the "American Museum of Natural History", [[New York City|New York]]. It was necessary to work in conjunction with the Boundary Directorate of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/Phelps%20%26%20Dickerman%201980.pdf|title=CUATRO SUBESPECIES NUEVAS DE AVES (FURNARIIDAE, FORMICARIIDAE) DE LA REGION DE PANTEPUI, ESTADO BOLIVAR Y TERRITORIO AMAZONAS, VENEZUELA|last=Phelps|first=William|last2=Robert|first2=Dickerman|date=1980|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias Naturales|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''world language''' is spoken internationally and is learned and spoken by a large number of people as a [[second language]]. A world language is characterized not only by the total number of speakers (native and second language speakers), but also by its geographical distribution, as well as use in [[international organizations]] and [[diplomatic relations]].&lt;ref name="weltalmanach.de"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.weltalmanach.de/stichwort/stichwort_weltsprachen.html |title=Fischer Weltalmanach |publisher=S.

One of the most widely spoken and fastest spreading world languages today is [[English language|English]], which has over 980,000,000 first- and [[English as a second or foreign language|second-language]] users worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng |title=English |website=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

===Asian languages===

====Arabic====
[[Arabic language|Arabic]] gained international prominence because of the medieval [[Islamic conquests]] and the subsequent [[Arabization]] of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and it is also a [[liturgical language]] amongst Muslim communities outside the [[Arab World]].

====Chinese====
[[Standard Chinese]] is the direct replacement of [[Classical Chinese]], which was a historical [[lingua franca]] in [[Far East Asia]] until the early 20th century, and today serves as a common language between speakers of other [[varieties of Chinese]] not only within [[China proper]] (between the [[Han Chinese]] and other unrelated ethnic groups), but in [[overseas Chinese]] communities. It is also widely taught as a second language internationally.

====Indian languages====
The [[Languages of India|major languages]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] have numbers of speakers comparable to those of major world languages primarily due to the large population in the region rather than a supra-regional use of these languages, although [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (including all [[Hindi dialects]], and [[Urdu]]), [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] may fulfill the criteria in terms of supra-regional usage and international recognition.{{fact|date=August 2018}} As an example, the native speaking population of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] vastly outnumber those who speak French as a first language, and it is one of the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]] (ranking fifth&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/country |title=Summary by country |website=Ethnologue |access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sixth&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |title=Languages Spoken by More Than 10 Million People |accessdate=2007-02-18 |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109093116/http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |archivedate=January 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the world with nearly 230 million total speakers, and is known for its long and rich literary tradition.

===European languages===

====English====
In addition to 370 million native speakers, English is estimated to have over 610 million second-language speakers,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; including anywhere between 200 and 350 million learners/users in China alone,&lt;ref name="Wei Su 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=Rining|author2=Jinzhi Su|title=The statistics of English in China|journal=English Today|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=28|issue=03|year=2012|pages=10–14|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266078412000235|doi=10.1017/s0266078412000235|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at varying levels of study and proficiency, though this number is difficult to accurately assess.&lt;ref name="Crystal2006"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511791154&amp;cid=CBO9780511791154A019 |title=A History of the English Language |last=Crystal |first=David |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |editor-last=Hogg |editor-first=Richard |pages=420-439 |chapter=9 - English worldwide |editor-last2=Denison |editor-first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is also increasingly becoming the dominant language of scientific research and papers worldwide, having even outpaced national languages in Western European countries, including France, where a recent study showed that English has massively displaced French as the language of scientific research in "hard" as well as in applied sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Héran |first=François |date=June 2013 |title=No English please!

====French====
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[French language|French]] was the language of communication and diplomacy, and the favoured second language among the elite and the educated classes in Europe (including Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Ukraine) - as well as in many [[Middle East and North Africa]]n countries such as Syria, Egypt, Ottoman Turkey and Iran. In addition, French enjoyed high status in some southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), and several South American ones like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. However, French has declined steadily since World War I, being gradually displaced by English - although in Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, French continues to be the favoured second language. Moreover, French still remains one of the [[working language]]s of many international organizations, including the [[United Nations]], [[European Union]] and [[NAFTA]]. French is also internationally recognized to be of high [[linguistic prestige]], still used in diplomacy and international commerce, as well as having a significant portion of second language speakers throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/official-languages/ |title=Official Languages |website=United Nations |access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====German====
[[German language|German]] served as a lingua franca in large portions of Europe for centuries, mainly the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. It remains an important second language in much of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], and in the international scientific community.

====Russian====
[[Russian language|Russian]] was used in the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and its teaching was made compulsory in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. However, the use and teaching of Russian has declined sharply in both the former Eastern bloc and the [[near abroad]] since the break up of the Soviet Union and Russia’s deputy education minister was quoted as saying in December 2013 that the number of Russian speakers had fallen by 100 million since that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/russias-waning-soft-power-in-central-asia/ |title=Russia’s Waning Soft Power in Central Asia |last=Blank  |first=Stephen |date=9 January 2015 |website=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/71376 |title=Kyrgyzstan’s Russian-Language Teaching Getting Squeezed Out |  |date=15 December 2014 |work=Eurasianet |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/english-replaces-russian-as-top-foreign-language-of-study-in-ex-soviet-georgia/1528063.html |title=English Replaces Russian as Top Foreign Language of Study in Ex-Soviet Georgia |last=Brooke |first=James |date=17 October 2012 |work=VOA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still widely spoken throughout the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Baltic states]].

Russian is the largest [[native language]] in Europe, one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages]] of the [[United Nations]], one of two official languages aboard the [[International Space Station]] and the third most widespread language on the [[Languages used on the Internet|Internet]] after [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language/all |title=Usage Statistics and Market Share of Content Languages for Websites |website=w3techs.com |language=en |access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spanish====
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|world's second-most spoken native language]], after [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Spanish was used in the [[Spanish Empire]] and today is in use in [[Spain]], in [[Latin American]] countries (except Brazil, French Guyana, Suriname, Guiana, Haiti and other Caribbean islands), and is spoken in many parts of the [[United States]], particularly in Florida and the states which border Mexico. Indeed, by 2013 Spanish was the most widely taught non-English language in American secondary schools and schools of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Goldberg |first=David |title=Enrollments in Languages Other Than English in United States Institutions of Higher Education, Fall 2013 |date=February 2015 |url=https://www.mla.org/content/download/31180/1452509/EMB_enrllmnts_nonEngl_2013.pdf |publisher=Modern Language Association of America |access-date=May 11, 2017 |last2=Looney |first2=Dennis  |last3=Lusin |first3=Natalia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[Official languages of the United Nations|official language of the United Nations]]. As of December 2017 Spanish had the third largest number of internet users by language (after English and Chinese).&lt;ref name="NIUBL-IWS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm |title=Number of Internet Users by Language |website=Internet World Stats |access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historical languages which had international significance as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of a historical [[empire]] include [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] in [[Ancient Egypt]]; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] in the various [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations and empires in the [[Ancient Near East]]; [[Ancient Greek]] in the [[Greek colonies]] in the form of various dialects, evolving to [[Koine Greek]] in the [[Hellenistic world]], after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Macedonian Empire]], and subsequently in the [[Greek East and Latin West|eastern part]] of the Roman Empire and the territories of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; [[Latin]] in the [[Roman Empire]] and presently as the standard liturgical language for the Catholic faithful worldwide; [[Classical Chinese]] in [[East Asia]] during the [[Imperial era of Chinese history]]; [[Persian language|Persian]] during the various succeeding [[Persian Empire]]s, and once served as the second lingua franca of the [[Islamic World]] after Arabic;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization |last=Nasr  |first=Seyyed Hossein |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanskrit]] during the ancient and medieval historical periods of various states in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], and like Latin an important liturgical language of the [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religions]].

The [[Romance languages]] bear testimony to the role of [[Latin]] as the ''lingua franca'' of the [[Roman Empire]]; for example, [[Italian language|Italian]] has always been important in the [[Mediterranean]] region, and nowadays it is the most-spoken language among members of the [[Roman catholic]] hierarchy and it is also used in music (especially [[Opera]]) and the fashion industry. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] was similarly important as the primary language of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Koine Greek]] was the "world language" of the [[Hellenistic period]], but its distribution is not reflected in the distribution of [[Modern Greek]] due to the linguistic impact of the [[Slavs|Slavic]], [[Muslim conquests|Arabic]] and [[Turkic migration|Turkic]] expansions. The distribution of the Arabic and [[Turkic languages]], in turn, are a legacy of the [[Caliphate]]s and the [[Turkic Khaganate]], respectively.

Just as all the living world languages owe their status to [[linguistic imperialism]], the suggestion of a given language as a world language or "[[universal language]]" has strong political implications. Thus, Russian was declared the "world language of [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]]" in Soviet literature, which at the same time denounced French as the "language of fancy courtiers" and English as the "jargon of traders".&lt;ref name="Pei105"&gt;Pei, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[international auxiliary languages]] have been introduced as prospective world languages, the most successful of them being [[Esperanto]], but none were learned by as many people as the world languages were.  Many natural languages have been proffered as candidates for a global ''[[lingua franca]]''.&lt;ref name="Pei105"/&gt;

==Living world languages==
Some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-world-language.htm |title=What Is a World Language? (with pictures) |website=wisegeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/11/what-global-language/378425/|title=What Global Language?|first=Barbara|last=Wallraff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; define a living world language as having the following properties:
* a large number of speakers
* a substantial fraction of non-native speakers (function as ''[[lingua franca]]'')
* [[official language|official]] status in several countries
* use across several regions in the world 
* a linguistic community not defined strictly along [[ethnicity|ethnic]] lines ([[multiethnic]], [[pluricentric language]])
* one or more [[standard language|standard registers]] which are widely [[language education|taught]] as a [[foreign language]]
* association with [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|linguistic prestige]]
* use in [[international trade relations]]
* use in [[international organizations]]
* use in the [[academic community]]
* significant body of [[literature]]
 
Certain languages with greater than 100 million speakers, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], are not listed. Japanese, although considered to be one of the most significant languages internationally, along with the listed world languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm|title=The World's 10 most influential Languages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not considered a world language ''per se''. Japan as a region is nearly homogeneous from ethnic, cultural and linguistic standpoints. Thus Japanese has little history as a ''lingua franca'' amongst communities who do not share a mother tongue or first language; their overseas communities are strongly tied to ethnicity. While international interest since the 1980s has prompted many major universities, secondary schools, and even primary schools worldwide to [[Japanese language education|offer courses in the language]], Japanese only exerts a regionally limited sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' Pei p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
:{{note|Alpha|α}} In contrast to other pluricentric languages (e.g., Arabic or Malay), [[Ethnologue]] only lists "Standard German", thereby excluding Swiss German and numerous other varieties of German. Summing up Standard German as well as all undisputed German dialects/varieties (see ISO-list in infobox at [[German language]]) that are not listed under "Standard German" results in ca. 90 M native speakers. Furthermore, Ammon (2014)&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014"/&gt; points out that Ethnologue overestimates L2 speakers, thus underestimating L1 speakers, in Germany by 5M --&gt; 95M L1 speakers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28589">{{Nihongo3|"fourth generation"|四世|'''Yonsei'''}} is a [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese diasporic]] term used in countries, particularly in [[North America]] and in [[Latin America]], to specify the great-grandchildren of [[Japanese immigrants]] ([[Issei]]). The children of Issei are [[Nisei]] (the second generation). [[Sansei]] are the third generation,&lt;ref&gt;In Japanese counting, "one, two, three, four" is "ichi, ni, san, yon"—''see'' [[Japanese numerals]]&lt;/ref&gt; and their offspring are Yonsei.&lt;ref&gt;Nomura, Gail M.

==History==
[[File:Asian Family in Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|The great-grandchildren of these Japanese-Brazilian (''Nipo-brasileiros'') immigrants would be called ''Yonsei''.]]
The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in [[Mexico]] in 1897,&lt;ref name="mofa-Mexico"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html  ''Japan-Mexico Foreign Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the four largest populations of Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants live in [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Peru]].

''Yonsei'' is a term used in geographic areas outside Japan to specify the child of at least one ''Sansei'' (third generation) parent, who is the child of at least one ''Nisei'' (second generation), who is the child of at least one ''Issei'' parent. An Issei is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] person who emigrated from Japan. Typically, if a person is ''Yonsei,'' more than one of his or her great-grandparents were born in Japan.

===Brazilian ''Yonsei''===
{{main|Japanese Brazilians}}
Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside [[Japan]], numbering an estimate of more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/brazil/index.html Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Japan-Brazil Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; more than that of the 1.2&amp;nbsp;million in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR:041&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en US Census data 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112230718/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR:041&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en |date=November 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Yonsei'' Japanese Brazilians are statistically significant component of that ethnic minority in that [[South America]]n nation, comprising 12.95% of the Japanese Brazilian population in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Doi, Elza Takeo.

===American ''Yonsei''===
{{main|Japanese Americans}}
The term [[Yonsei Japanese American|''Yonsei'' Japanese American]] refers generally to ''Yonsei'' citizens of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Murakami-Tsuda, Vicky. [http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/1707 "A Yonsei's Reflections…on Unearthing My Family's Values,"] Discover Nikkei. June 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term's usage is flexible—describing both ''emigrant'' and ''immigrant'' experiences. Most of the interned [[Japanese Peruvians|Japanese-Peruvian]] ''Nisei'' who were deported from Peru during World War II became naturalized American citizens; but they considered their naturalized children as ''Sansei,'' meaning three generations away from the emigrants who had sailed to South America at the turn of the century. From this perspective, the sons and daughters of these formerly stateless refugees would be ''Yonsei,'' even as offspring of parents who would be otherwise categorized as ''Issei'' or "first generation" immigrants would also be called ''Nisei.''&lt;ref&gt;Higashide, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ORE5wfUNdccC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=Adios+to+Tears:+The+Memoirs+of+a+Japanese-Peruvian+Internee+in+U.S.+Concentration+Camps&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PPA222,M1  p. 222.]&lt;/ref&gt;

(2002). "Making Yonsei" in Okamura Jonathan (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lE0OAAAACAAJ ''The Japanese American Contemporary Experience in Hawaii.''] Honolulu: [[University of Hawaii Press]]. {{ISBN|0-8248-2687-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she compares and contrasts the ''yonsei'' generation with previous Hawaiian Japanese generations.&lt;ref name="Okamura-138"/&gt;

The ''yonsei'' differ from previous generation of Japanese-Americans in that the overt discrimination, World War II and the internment camps which overshadowed the lives of previous generations are concepts unrelated to their daily existence.&lt;ref name="Armbruster"&gt;Armbruster, Shirley. (1998-3-1). "Melding into the melting pot Third-generation Japanese-Americans who intermarry want their children to remember and honor their heritage", ''[[The Fresno Bee]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of obvious struggles or difficulties faced by previous generations of Japanese-Americans, the ''yonsei'' are sometimes called the "spoiled generation".&lt;ref&gt;Okamura. (2008). p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''yonsei'' generation in Hawai'i can be compared to white Americans in the continental U.S. The ''yonsei'' have an equal, if not higher, educational, economic and political status as their continental white counterparts, and also have a low immigration rate, as Japanese immigration has declined since 1965.&lt;ref name="Ishikawa"&gt;Ishikawa, Juri (2006). ''Yonsei Japanese American Women in Hawai'i'' quoted in Okamura, Jonathan Y. (2008). ''Ethnicity and Inequality in Hawai'i'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=mmqx_G9qzScC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA143#PPA144,M1 p.144.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, intermarriage with non-Japanese became common in the Japanese American community in the 1960s. Intermarriage among Japanese Americans was at approximately 50% by the 1970s, and at 70% in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Armbruster"/&gt; This cultural distance from the original homeland results in a "symbolic" expression of ethnicity seen in both the continental white and the Hawaiian ''yonsei'' groups. Outside of the continental white population, the ''yonsei'' of Hawai'i are one of the few U.S. ethnic groups that express their ethnicity in a "symbolic" way.&lt;ref name="Ishikawa"/&gt;

While members of the ''sansei'' and ''yonsei'' generation may visit Japan, they tend to see this activity only as tourism. Japanese cultural structure is generally not present among the ''yonsei'' generation.&lt;ref&gt;Okamura. (2008). p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2006 study of ''yonsei'' women in Hawai'i, this generation of Japanese-Americans tends to assert their ethnicity in such "symbolic" ways as the celebration of holidays and ceremonies associated with Japan, eating ethnic foods, and the use of Japanese middle-names. The study noted that the ''yonsei'' generation considered its ethnicity to be less important than did previous generations of Japanese-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Ishikawa (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mmqx_G9qzScC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143 p.143-144.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cheryl Lynn Sullivan, an ethnic research who specializes in the Japanese-American community of California, wrote, "It is common in the Japanese American community not to consider yonsei Japanese American -- they are 'just plain Americans.' This is especially true of children who are the offspring of Japanese American-Euro-American marriages."&lt;ref name="Armbruster"/&gt; Others celebrate their ancestry in cultural exchanges based around youth and sports events, e.g. [http://www.yonseiyouth.com/ Yonsei Basketball Association].

According to a 2011 columnist in ''The Rafu Shimpo'' of Los Angeles, "Younger Japanese Americans are more culturally American than Japanese" and "other than some vestigial cultural affiliations, a ''Yonsei'' or ''Gosei'' is simply another American."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, George Toshio. [http://rafu.com/news/2011/02/itns-ja-newspapers/  "Into the Next Stage: Japanese American Newspapers: Over and Out?"] ''Rafu Shimpo'' (US). February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different organizations were created within the Japanese American community in order for the children of these Japanese American families to have a place where they could partake in different extracurricular activities, such as basketball, golf, baseball, etc. One such organization was the Yonsei Basketball Association, which was created in 1993 by Frank Kiyomura. Its mission statement is, "Our program was founded with a goal of providing a cultural exchange program for Fourth Generation Japanese-American youth from Southern California. We want to provide an opportunity for all participants to experience their heritage and cultural roots. In addition, we hope to provide a goodwill exchange of ideas and cultures by living with local Japanese families." Every year they give out scholarships to selected children from the Japanese American community and assemble both a boys' and girls' team together to send and play in a tournament in Japan.&lt;ref name="yonseibasketball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yonseibasketball.org/|title=Yonsei Basketball Association &amp;#124;|publisher=yonseibasketball.org|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, distinct generational subgroups developed, each with different sociocultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences.&lt;ref name="mclellan36"&gt;McLellan, Janet.

{{main|Japanese diaspora}}
The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ "What is Nikkei?"] Japanese American National Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;   The collective memory of the ''Issei'' and older ''Nisei'' was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911, which contrasted sharply with the Japan that newer immigrants had more recently left. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.&lt;ref name="mclellan37"&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA37,M1  p. 37.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, the significant differences in life experiences and opportunities has done little to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives amongst their children and grandchildren.

The ''Yonsei,'' their parents, their grandparents, and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA68,M1  p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently just over one hundred thousand [[Japanese community in the United Kingdom|British Japanese]], mostly in [[London]]; but unlike other ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' communities elsewhere in the world, these Britons do not conventionally parse their communities in generational terms as ''Issei,'' ''Nisei,'' or ''Sansei.'' Usually in Britain, there are only Issei and Nisei anyway, since Nisei almost always marry non-Japanese, and Issei to a lesser extent.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBijCPLvWyUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=keiko+itoh++united+kingdom&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA7,M1  p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of ''yonsei'' who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the ''nikkei.'' Although the names highlighted here are over-represented by ''sansei'' from North America, the Latin American member countries of the [[Pan American Nikkei Association]] (PANA) include [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]], in addition to the English-speaking [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Japanese Canadians: [http://www.najc.ca/thenandnow/relations_pana.php PANA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218195725/http://www.najc.ca/thenandnow/relations_pana.php |date=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
