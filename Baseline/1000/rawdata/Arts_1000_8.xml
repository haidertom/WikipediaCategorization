'''The aestheticization of politics''' was an idea first coined by [[Walter Benjamin]] as being a key ingredient to [[Fascist]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jay|first=Martin|year=1992|title="The Aesthetic Ideology" as Ideology; Or, What Does It Mean to Aestheticize Politics?|journal=Cultural Critique|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|issue=21|jstor=1354116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, life and the affairs of living are conceived of as innately [[art]]istic, and related to as such politically. [[Politics]] are in turn viewed as artistic, and structured like an [[art form]] which reciprocates the artistic conception of life being seen as art.

This has also been noted as being connected to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] movement and postulated as its main motivation for getting involved in the Fascist regime of [[Italy]].

Alternately, "[[politicization of aesthetics]]" (or "politicization of art") has been used as a term for an [[ideology|ideologically]] opposing synthesis, sometimes associated with the [[Soviet Union]], wherein art is ultimately subordinate to political life and thus a result of it, separate from it, but which is attempted to be incorporated for political use as theory relating to the consequential political nature of art. The author [[Emilio Gentile]] has stressed that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and both regimes had a large degree of the other. In Benjamin's original formulation, however, the politicization of aesthetics was treated conceptually as the polar opposite of the aestheticization of politics, the former treated as a kind of revolutionary praxis, redeeming force, or "antidote" to the corrupting fascistic influence of the latter.

'''Anamorphosis''' is a distorted projection or perspective requiring the viewer to use special devices or occupy a specific vantage point (or both) to view a recognizable image. Some of the media it is used in are painting, photography, sculpture and installation, toys, and film special effects.  The word "anamorphosis" is derived from the Greek prefix ''ana&amp;#8209;'', meaning "back" or "again", and the word ''morphe'', meaning "shape" or "form". An optical anamorphism is the visualization of a mathematical operation called an [[affine transformation]].&lt;ref name="Sánchez-Reyes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sánchez-Reyes|first1=Javier|last2=Chacón|first2=Jesús M.|title=Anamorphic Free-Form Deformation|journal=Computer Aided Geometric Design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167839616300826 |accessdate=February 23, 2017 |pages=30–42|doi=10.1016/j.cagd.2016.06.002|date=August 1, 2016|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of extreme anamorphosis has been used by artists to disguise [[caricature]]s, [[erotic]] and [[scatological]] scenes, and other furtive images from a casual viewer, while revealing an undistorted image to the knowledgeable spectator.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Daniel L. |title=Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer: History, Technique and Current Practice |journal=Leonardo |date=1992 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179 |doi=10.2307/1575710|jstor=1575710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of projection==
[[File:Anamorphosis chair.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of mirror anamorphosis]]

There are two main types of anamorphosis: ''perspective'' (oblique) and ''mirror'' (catoptric). More-complex anamorphoses can be devised using distorted lenses, mirrors, or other optical transformations.

Examples of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival]] anamorphosis date to the early [[Renaissance]] (fifteenth century).&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977" /&gt; Examples of mirror anamorphosis were first seen in the late Renaissance (sixteenth century).

With mirror anamorphosis, a conical or cylindrical [[mirror]] is placed on the drawing or painting to transform a flat distorted image into an apparently undistorted picture that can be viewed from many angles. The deformed image is painted on a plane surface surrounding the mirror. By looking into the mirror, a viewer can see the image undeformed.

With ''Channel anamorphosis'' or ''[[turning picture]]s'' two different images are on different sides of a corrugated carrier. A straight frontal view shows an unclear mix of the images, while each image can be viewed correctly from a certain angle.

==History==
===Early Use of Distorted Perspective===
The prehistoric cave paintings at [[Lascaux]] may make use of anamorphic technique, because the oblique angles of the cave would otherwise result in distorted figures from a viewer's perspective.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The ancient historians [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Tzetzes]] both record a sculpture competition between [[Alcamenes]] and [[Phidias]] to create an image of [[Minerva]]. Alcamenes' sculpture was beautiful, while Phidias' had grotesque proportions. Yet once both had been mounted on pillars, the decelerated perspective made Phidias' Minerva beautiful and Alcamenes' ugly.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=7-8}}

===Renaissance===
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' with a ''[[memento mori]]'' anamorph skull in the foreground, 1533 ]]

[[File:Holbein Skull.jpg|thumb|Viewed from the correct oblique angle, the diagonal in ''The Ambassadors'' transforms into an undistorted ''memento mori''.]]

During the Renaissance, artists' experimentation with optics and perspective lead to more advanced development of anamorphic imagery. At this time, religious thought and science were equally important to the technique's growth in Europe. {{r|Baltrušaitis 1977| p=70}} The earliest known example, known as ''Leonardo's Eye'', was executed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and is included in the ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (1483-1518). He later completed several large-scale anamorphic commissions for the King of France. [[Vignolo]] credited [[Tommasso Lauretti]] as the originator of a perspectival anamorphic technique in one of the earliest written descriptions in ''Two Rules'', compiled between 1530 and 1540 but not published until 1583. Without access to Vignolo's work, many other descriptions and examples were created before 1583.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977| p=29-30,32-33}}

''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' (c. 1533) by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] is well known for the prominent oblique anamorphic transformation in the painting. In this artwork, a distorted shape lies diagonally across the bottom of the frame. Viewing this from an acute angle transforms it into the plastic image of a [[human skull]]. The painting is regarded as a ''[[vanitas]]'' - a meditation on the transience of life - with the skull a symbolic ''[[memento mori]]''. The altered perspective required to see the image reflects the contemporary practice of painting skulls on the reverse of otherwise tranquil paintings.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|chapter=7 Holbein's 'The Ambassadors'}} Four centuries later, the painting inspired the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jaques Lacan]] to note in ‘Of the Gaze as ''Objet Petit a''’ (1973) that the use of anamorphism, particularly in this painting, is one of the few methods for making viewers aware of their gaze.&lt;ref name="Scott DS Project"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Maria |title=Deciphering the Gaze in Lacan's 'Of the Gaze as Objet Petit {{!}} The DS Project |url=http://thedsproject.com/portfolio/deciphering-the-gaze-in-lacans-of-the-gaze-as-objet-petit-a/ |website=The DS Project |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century, a revival of fantastical anamorphic imagery occurred.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=26-28}} Mirror anamorphosis emerged at this time in Italy and China. It remains uncertain whether Jesuit missionaries imported or exported the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication |jstor= 3049875|title= Review: Anamorphic Act by Jurgis Baltrušaitis |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major works on perspective were published: ''Perspective''(1612) by [[Salomon de Caus]], and ''Curious Perspective'' (1638) by [[Jean-Francois Niceron]]. Each contained extensive  scientific and practical infromation on anamorphic imagery. In Niceron's work, three types of large-scale anamorphism are explained: 'optical' (looking horizontally); 'anoptric' (looking upwards); and 'catoptric' (looking down ie. from a mezzanine). A conical perspective is also described.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=26-28}}

[[File:Sant'Ignazio - affresco soffitto -antmoose.jpg |thumb|[[Andrea Pozzo]]'s painted ceiling in the [[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Church of St. Ignazio]], 1690]]
[[Baroque]] ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' murals often used anamorphism to combine actual architectural elements with illusory painted elements to create a seamless effect when viewed  from a specific location. The dome and vault of the [[Sant'Ignazio|Church of St. Ignazio]] in Rome, painted by [[Andrea Pozzo]], represented the pinnacle of illusion. Due to neighboring monks complaining about blocked light, Pozzo was commissioned to paint the ceiling to look like the inside of a dome, instead of building a real dome. As the ceiling is flat, there is only one spot where the illusion is perfect and a dome looks undistorted.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Anamorphosis could be used to conceal images for privacy or personal safety, and many secret portraits were created of deposed royalty. A well-known anamorphic portrait of the English [[King Edward VI]] was completed a year before his execution in 1546, only visible when viewed through a hole in the frame. It was later hung at [[Whitehall Palace]], and may have influenced [[Shakespeare]] during the writing of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=16-18}} Many anamorphic portraits of [[King Charles I]] were created and shared following his 1649 execution.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=28}}  A secret mirror anamorphosis portrait of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] can only be recognized when a polished cylinder is placed in the correct position. To possess such an image would have been seen as [[treason]] in the aftermath of the 1746 [[Battle of Culloden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westhighlandmuseum.org.uk/collections/the-jacobites/secret-portrait/ |title=Now you see me  |publisher=[[West Highland Museum]] |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth Century===
[[File:Thomas-Mole-Living Emblem-1919-USMC.jpg|thumb|Thomas and Mole, ''Living Emblem'' (1919). USMC]]
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, anamorphic images had come to be used more as [[children's games]] than fine art.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; By the twentieth century, some artists wanted to renew the technique of anamorphosis for aesthetic and conceptual effect. During the First World War [[Arthur Mole]], an American commercial photographer, used anamorphic techniques to create patriotic images from massive assembled groups of soldiers and reservists. When seen from high above, the gathered people resolved into recognizable pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Radio |first1=Minnesota Public |title=MPR: Group setting |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/01/28_robertsc_grouppix/ |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=news.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=28 January 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcel Duchamp]] was interested in anamorphosis. His last work ''[[Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas]]'' (1946-66) used mild anamorphosis to force viewers into the position of peep-hole voyeurs in order to see a nude, anonymous human body.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Surrealist]] artist [[Salvador Dalí]] used extreme [[foreshortening]] and anamorphism in his paintings and works, and had a [[glass floor]] installed in a room next to his studio to enable radical perspective studies from above and below.&lt;ref name=GlassFloor&gt;{{cite book|last=Ades|first=ed. by Dawn|title=Dalí's optical illusions : [Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, January 21 - March 26, 2000 : Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, April 19 - June 18, 2000 ; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, July 25 - October 1, 2000]|year=2000|publisher=Yale Univ.

==Impossible objects==
[[File:Necker cube.svg|thumb|Necker cube]]
In the twentieth century, artists began to play with perspective by drawing "impossible objects". These objects included stairs that always ascend, or cubes where the back meets the front. Such works were popularized by the artist [[M. C. Escher]] and the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]]. Although referred to as "impossible objects", such objects as the [[Necker Cube]] and the [[Penrose triangle]] can be sculpted in 3-D by using anamorphic illusion. When viewed at a certain angle, such sculptures appear as the so-called impossible objects.

==Ames Rooms==
[[File:Ames room forced perspective.jpg|thumb|Ames room forced perspective]]
[[File:Ames room.JPG|thumb|Ames room]]
The [[Ames room]] was invented by American scientist [[Adelbert Ames]], Jr. in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.psychologie.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/ames_room.html |title=Ames Room |first= |last= |work=psychologie.tu-dresden.de |year=2001  |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When viewed through a peephole, the room appears to have normal perspective. However, all other viewpoints reveal that the room is constructed of irregular trapezoids. Similar effects had been achieved during the Renaissance through the use of "accelerated perspective" in stage design. These included productions by Scamozzi (1588-9), Furtenbach (1625), Sabbattini (1637) and Troili (1672).&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baltrušaitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810906624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most interesting effects of an Ames room is that the distorted perspective can make people and objects looks much bigger or smaller than they really are.&lt;ref name="EB Anamorphosis"&gt;{{cite web |title=Anamorphosis art |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/anamorphosis-art |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=18 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Ames rooms are widely used in cinema for [[practical special effects]]. A well-known example is the homes in the Shire from the [[Lord of The Rings (film franchise)|Lord of the Rings]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]] films. Through the use of [[forced perspective]], the character of Gandalf appeared much larger than the characters of Frodo and Bilbo, without the use of digital effects.&lt;ref name="Cosmos"&gt;{{cite web |last1=England |first1=Jason |title=Hobbit houses and the Moon trick the brain and eye {{!}} Cosmos |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/hobbit-houses-and-moon-trick-brain-and-eye |website=cosmosmagazine.com |accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=en |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==
[[Cinemascope]], [[Panavision]], [[Technirama]], and other [[widescreen]] formats use anamorphosis to project a wider image from a narrower film frame. The [[IMAX]] company uses even more extreme anamorphic transformations to project moving images from a flat film frame onto the inside of a [[sphere|hemispheric]] dome, in its "Omnimax" or "IMAX Dome" process.
 
The technique of anamorphic projection can be seen quite commonly on text written at a very flat angle on roadways, such as "Bus Lane" or "Children Crossing", to make it easily read by drivers who otherwise would have difficulty reading obliquely as the vehicle approaches the text; when the vehicle is nearly above the text, its true abnormally elongated shape can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 3B.20 Pavement Word, Symbol, and Arrow Markings|url=https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part3/part3b.htm#section3B20|work=[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]|publisher=United States [[Federal Highway Administration]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in many sporting stadiums, especially in [[Rugby football]] in [[Australia]], it is used to promote company brands which are painted onto the playing surface; from the television camera angle, the writing appear as signs standing vertically within the field of play.

Much writing on shop windows is in principle anamorphic, as it was written mirror-reversed on the inside of the window glass.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==In the work of contemporary artists==
[[File:Manfred Stader Stocznia Szczecinska 1 (Piotr Kuczynski).jpg|thumb|Anamorphic street art by [[Manfred Stader]]]]
While not a widespread in contemporary art, anamorphosis as a technique has been used by contemporary artists in painting, photography,  [[printmaking]], sculpture, film and video, digital art and games, [[holography]],&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; [[street art]] and [[Installation art|installation]]. The latter two art forms are largely practised in public areas such as parks, city centres and transit stations&lt;ref name="WebUrbanist"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=SA |title=Perspective Puzzle: Anamorphic Art in the Toronto Subway |url=https://weburbanist.com/2010/05/08/perspective-puzzle-anamorphic-art-in-the-toronto-subway/ |website=WebUrbanist |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1975 a major exhibition was held focusing exclusively on anamorphic imagery - ''Anamorphoses: Games of Perception and Illusion in Art''. The artist [[Jan Beutener]] created ''The Room'' - a major new installation - specifically for the exhibit.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

The ''Presence of Absence'' is an ongoing exhibition focusing on anamorphic art. It features work by [[Patrick Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

===Sculpture and Installation===
[[File:West Bromwich Bus Station - sign and mosaic's (5580214957).jpg|thumb|Anamorphic mosaic art in a [[West Bromwich]] bus station.]]

Since the mid-20th century, many artists have made use of anamorphosis in public artworks. American [[Land art]] pioneer [[Michael Heizer|Michael Heizer's]] ''Complex One'' (1972-1974), a massive earth and concrete structure in the [[Nevada]] desert, creates a rectangular frame for a [[mastaba]] when viewed from a specific location.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; Inspired by [[Luxor]] and other ancient monumental sites, it is part of the larger work ''City'', an enormous sculpture running a mile and a half long. The entire work will not be completed until 2020.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodyear |first1=Dana |title=A Monument to Outlast Humanity |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/michael-heizers-city |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Marcus Raetz]] created anamorphic sculptures ranging in size from large-scale public installation to something that could fit in your hand. One of his largest pieces, ''Kopf'', revealed the form of a person's head in profile when viewed from a specific vantage-point. It was installed in a public park in [[Basel, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Shigeo Fukuda]], a Japanese artist and designer globally renowned for his satirical posters on anti-war and environmental advocacy&lt;ref name="NYT Fukuda"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heller |first1=Steven |title=Shigeo Fukuda, Graphic Designer of Wit and Allusion, Dies at 76 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/arts/design/20fukuda.html |accessdate=18 November 2018 |date=19 January 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, created posters and sculptures making use of both types of anamorphosis in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="illusionworks Fukada"&gt;{{cite web |title=Art of Shigeo Fukada |url=https://psy2.psych.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/art_of_shigeo_fukuda.html |publisher=Illusionworks |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote multiple books on the topic of optical illusions.

While anamorphic images were not his exclusive area of focus, the American artist [[Jonathan Borofsky]] created installations in the 1980's using anamorphic techniques, exhibiting at institutions such as the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Jean-Max Albert]] created three public sculptures using anamorphosis:''Un carré pour un square'', ''Cube fantôme'' and ''Reflet anamorphose'' (1985). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, French artist [[François Abélanet]]'s anamorphic garden work ''Qui croire? (Who to believe?)'' was featured in front of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Adams|first=Henry|title=Is a "Garden" the World's Greatest New Artwork?|date=Nov 29, 2011|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/art/2011/11/is-a-garden-the-worlds-greatest-new-artwork/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felice Varini|Felici Varini's]] 2014 work ''Three Ellipses for Three Locks'' in [[Hasselt, Belgium]] is an image of three loops that are  made up of segments painted on to over 100 buildings. It is only visible from a specific vantage point over the city.&lt;ref name="EB Anamorphosis" /&gt;

===Drawing and Painting===
The Swedish artist Hans Hamngren produced and exhibited many examples of mirror anamorphosis in the 1960s and 1970s. 

===Photography===
Beginning in 1967, Dutch artist [[Jan Dibbets]] based an entire series of photographic work titled ''Perspective Corrections'' on the distortion of reality through perspective anamorphosis. This involved the incorporation of land art into his work, where areas dug out of the Earth formed squares from specific perspectives.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

===Street Art===
Anamorphic effects are popular in street art, sometimes called "Slant Art" when accomplished on sidewalks. Examples are the [[sidewalk chalk]] drawings of [[Kurt Wenner]] and [[Julian Beever]]&lt;ref name="WebUrbanist" /&gt;, where the chalked image, the pavement, and the architectural surroundings all become part of an illusion. Art of this style can be produced by taking a photograph of an object or setting at a sharp oblique angle, then putting a grid over the photograph. Another elongated grid is placed on the sidewalk based on a specific perspective, and visual elements of one are transcribed into the other, one grid square at a time.

In 2016, the street artist [[JR (artist)|JR]] completed a massive temporary anamorphic illusion over the [[Louvre|Louvre's]] pyramid, making the modern structure disappear and the original building appear as though it was still in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="JR 2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=JR completes monumental anamorphic artwork on the louvre's glass pyramid |url=https://www.designboom.com/art/jr-louvre-museum-installation-paris-05-24-2016/ |website=designboom architecture &amp; design magazine |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animal style''' art is an approach to decoration found from [[China]] to [[Northern Europe]] in the early [[Iron Age]], and the [[barbarian art]] of the [[Migration Period]], characterized by its emphasis on animal motifs. The [[zoomorphic]] style of decoration was used to decorate small objects by warrior-herdsmen, whose economy was based on breeding and herding animals, supplemented by trade and plunder.&lt;ref&gt;Emma C.Bunker, ''Animal Style Art from East to West'', Asia Society. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Animal art]] is a more general term for all art depicting animals.

{{Main article|Scythian art}}

[[Scythian art]] makes great use of animal motifs, one component of the "[[Scythian]] triad" of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild [[animal art]]. The cultures referred to as Scythian-style included the [[Cimmerian]] and [[Sarmatian]] cultures in European [[Sarmatia]] and stretched across the [[Eurasian steppe]] north of the [[Near East]] to the [[Ordos culture]] of [[China]]. These cultures were extremely influential in spreading many local versions of the style.&lt;!--See Ptolemy's European Sarmatia [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Claudius_Ptolemy-_The_World.jpg]]--&gt;

[[Steppe]] jewellery features various animals including stags, cats, birds, horses, bears, wolves and mythical beasts. The gold figures of stags in a crouching position with legs tucked beneath its body, head upright and muscles tight to give the impression of speed, are particularly impressive. The "looped" antlers of most figures are a distinctive feature, not found in Chinese images of deer. The species represented has seemed to many scholars to be the [[reindeer]], which was not found in the regions inhabited by the steppes peoples at this period.  The largest of these were the central ornaments for shields, while others were smaller plaques probably attached to clothing.  The stag appears to have had a special significance for the steppes peoples, perhaps as a clan [[totem]]. The most notable of these figures include the examples from:
*the burial site of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]] in the [[Kuban]] dating from the 6th century BC (Hermitage)
*[[Tápiószentmárton]] in [[Hungary]] dating from the 5th century BC, now [[National Museum of Hungary]], [[Budapest]]
*[[Kul Oba]] in the [[Crimea]] dating from the 4th century BC (Hermitage).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Loehr|Loehr, Max]], "The Stag Image in Scythia and the Far East", ''Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America'', Vol. 9, (1955), pp. 63-76, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20066973 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic form is the [[openwork]] plaque including a stylized tree over the scene at one side, of which two examples are illustrated here. Later large Greek-made pieces often include a zone showing Scythian men apparently going about their daily business, in scenes more typical of Greek art than nomad-made pieces. Some scholars have attempted to attach narrative meanings to such scenes, but this remains speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, Ann, "Interpreting Scythian Art: East vs. West",
''Artibus Asiae'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1977), pp. 124-138, {{DOI|10.2307/3250196}}, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3250196 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gold was widely used by the ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the predominant material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse harness, leather belts &amp; personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins &amp; belts, helped to act as armour.
[[Image:Permic bear.jpg|thumb|150px|Bronze idol of a [[bear]] found in the [[Perm Krai]], 6th or 7th century.]]

The use of the animal form went further than just ornament, these seemingly imbuing the owner of the item with similar prowess and powers of the animal which was depicted. Thus the use of these forms extended onto the accoutrements of warfare, be they swords, daggers, scabbards, or axes.

A distinct [[Permian bronze casts|Permian style]] of bronze or copper alloy objects from around the 5th–10th centuries AD are found near the [[Ural mountains]] and the [[Volga]] and [[Kama River|Kama]] rivers in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanova, Vera, "[http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/visual_arts/200/ Perm Animal Style]", ''Russia.ic.com'' (23 June 2006), retrieved 23 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germanic animal style==
The study of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] zoomorphic decoration was pioneered by [[Bernhard Salin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Bernhard Salin|Biography on swedish Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; in a work published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''Die altgermanische Thierornamentik'', Stockholm 1904, [https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4889930W/Die_altgermanische_Thierornamentik The Open Library online text], written in German and heavily illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; Salin classified animal art from roughly 400 to 900 AD into three phases. The origins of these different phases remain the subject of debate; developing trends in late-Roman popular provincial art was an element, as were proceeding traditions of the nomadic Asiatic steppe peoples. Styles I and II are found widely across Europe in the art of the "barbarian" peoples during the [[Migration Period]].

'''Style I'''. First appearing in northwest Europe, first expressed with the introduction of the [[chip carving]] technique applied to bronze and silver in the 5th century. It is characterized by animals whose bodies are divided into sections, and typically appear at the fringes of designs whose main emphasis is on abstract patterns.

'''Style II'''. After about 560–570 Style I, declining, began to be supplanted. The animals of Style II are whole beasts, their bodies elongated into "ribbons" which intertwined into symmetrical shapes with no pretense of naturalism—rarely with legs—tending to be described as serpents, though heads often have characteristics of other animals. The animals become subsumed into ornamental patterns, typically [[interlace (art)|interlace]]. Examples of Style II can be found on the gold purse lid ([[:Image:Sutton.Hoo.PurseLid.RobRoy.jpg|picture]]) from [[Sutton Hoo]] (c. 625).

After about 700 localised styles develop, and it is no longer very useful to talk of a general Germanic style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yZVeZnUXMiAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Salin+animal+style&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Dj2KTNGGEY_KjAfQp4GKBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Salin%20animal%20style&amp;f=false Rituals of power: from late antiquity to the early Middle Ages],  By Frans Theuws, Janet L. Nelson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Salin '''Style III''' is found mainly in Scandinavia, and may also be called [[Viking art]].  Interlace, where it occurs, becomes less regular and more complex, and if not three-dimensional animals are usually seen in profile but twisted, exaggerated, surreal, with fragmented body parts filling every available space, creating an intense detailed energetic feel. Animals' bodies become hard for the unpractised viewer to read, and there is a very common motif of the "gripping beast" where an animal's mouth grips onto another element of the composition to connect two parts. Animal style was one component, along with [[Celtic art]] and late classical elements, in the formation of style of [[Insular art]] and [[Anglo-Saxon art]] in the British Isles, and through these routes and others on the Continent, left a considerable legacy in later Medieval art.

Other names are sometimes used: in [[Anglo-Saxon art]] Kendrick preferred "Helmet" and "Ribbon" for Styles I and II.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3cU4kkROdekC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=Salin+animal+style&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Dj2KTNGGEY_KjAfQp4GKBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Salin%20animal%20style&amp;f=false Hills]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">'''Art fabrication''' is a process or service relating to the production of large or technically difficult artworks.

When a lone artist or designer is incapable or chooses not to realize the creation of his or her own design or conception, he or she may enlist the assistance of an art fabrication studio.  Typically, an art fabrication studio has access to the resources, specialized machinery, and labor necessary to execute particularly complex projects.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Notable art fabricators==

Lippincott, Inc., founded in 1966 by Donald Lippincott and Roxanne Everett, was the first company to devote itself exclusively to art fabrication using industrial techniques. The company encouraged a collaborative relationship between artists and the fabrication crew, allowing the creation of work using media that artists had not previously used. Lippincott, Inc. fabricated work for almost 100 artists, including [[Barnett Newman]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Indiana]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Lee was born in [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire]] and attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1899 and subsequently qualified as a solicitor before becoming a director of the Sheffield cutlery manufacturers Walker &amp; Hall. He was a territorial officer with the [[Sherwood Foresters]] from 1903 and on the outbreak of [[World War One]] was mobilised with his regiment and sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1916 he served as a Major in Dublin where the Foresters suffered heavy losses during the [[Easter Rising]] and was awarded the DSO. He was then transferred to the HQ of the British Expeditionary Force as a Lieutenant-Colonel where he was appointed military censor. He had several well-recorded disputes with war artists, particularly [[William Orpen]] and [[Christopher Nevinson]] whose ''Paths of Glory'' Lee attempted to censor. Nevinson, however, still exhibited the work at a London exhibition in 1918 with a piece of brown paper across it bearing the word "Censored". Lee was awarded an OBE for his war work.&lt;ref name=IWMpaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20211|title=''Paths of Glory'' by CRW Nevinson |year=|accessdate=6 May 2017|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the war, Lee returned to Sheffield and his cutlery firm. In 1932 he served as [[Master Cutler]] &lt;ref&gt;http://925-1000.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=43796&lt;/ref&gt; of the Company of Cutlers. Lee, who had become a friend of William Orpen continued the friendship until Orpen's death in 1931 and was responsible for commissioning Orpen to paint [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] in 1923 on behalf of [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] of which Lee was a committee member..&lt;ref name="Upstone"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Upstone|publisher=Imperial War Museum &amp; Philip Wilson Publishers|year=2005|title=William Orpen: Politics Sex &amp; Death |ISBN=0 85667 596 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's personal papers were donated to the [[Imperial War Museum]] after his death, by his son Peter Murray Lee who had served as an intelligence officer in World War Two.

'''Inspiration''' (from the Latin ''inspirare'', meaning "to breathe into") is an unconscious burst of [[creativity]] in a literary, musical, or other artistic endeavour.  The concept has origins in both [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]] and [[Hebraism]]. The [[Greeks]] believed that inspiration or "[[enthusiasm]]" came from the [[muses]], as well as the gods [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]. Similarly, in the Ancient Norse religions, inspiration derives from the gods, such as [[Odin]]. Inspiration is also a divine matter in [[Hebrew]] poetics. In the ''[[Book of Amos]]'' the prophet speaks of being overwhelmed by God's voice and compelled to speak.  In [[Christianity]], inspiration is a gift of the [[Holy Spirit]].

In the 18th century [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[John Locke]] proposed a model of the human mind in which ideas associate or resonate with one another in the mind. In the 19th century, Romantic poets such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] believed that inspiration came to a poet because the poet was attuned to the (divine or mystical) "winds" and because the soul of the poet was able to receive such visions. In the early 20th century, [[Psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]] believed himself to have located inspiration in the inner psyche of the artist. [[Psychology|Psychiatrist]] [[Carl Gustav Jung]]'s theory of inspiration suggests that an artist is one who was attuned to [[racial memory]], which encoded the [[archetype]]s of the human mind.

The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of art sees it as the expression of the friction between economic base and economic superstructural positions, or as an unaware dialog of competing ideologies, or as an exploitation of a "fissure" in the ruling class's ideology. In modern [[psychology]] inspiration is not frequently studied, but it is generally seen as an entirely internal process.

==History of the concepts==

===Ancient models of inspiration===
In Greek thought, inspiration meant that the poet or artist would go into [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] or ''furor poeticus,'' the divine frenzy or poetic madness.  He or she would be transported beyond his own mind and given the gods' or goddesses own thoughts to embody.

Inspiration is prior to consciousness and outside of skill (''ingenium'' in Latin).  Technique and performance are independent of inspiration, and therefore it is possible for the non-poet to be inspired and for a poet or painter's skill to be insufficient to the inspiration. In [[Hebrew]] poetics, inspiration is similarly a divine matter.  In the ''[[Book of Amos]]'', 3:8 the prophet speaks of being overwhelmed by God's voice and compelled to speak.  However, inspiration is also a matter of [[revelation]] for the prophets, and the two concepts are intermixed to some degree.  Revelation is a conscious process, where the writer or painter is aware and interactive with the vision, while inspiration is involuntary and received without any complete understanding.

In [[Christianity]], [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] is a gift of the [[Holy Spirit]]. [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] said that all scripture is given by inspiration of God (''[[2 Timothy]]'') and the account of [[Pentecost]] records the Holy Spirit descending with the sound of a mighty wind.  This understanding of "inspiration" is vital for those who maintain [[Biblical literalism]], for the authors of the scriptures would, if possessed by the voice of God, not "filter" or interpose their personal visions onto the text. For church fathers like [[Saint Jerome]], [[David]] was the perfect poet, for he best negotiated between the divine impulse and the human consciousness.

In northern societies, such as [[Old Norse]], inspiration was likewise associated with a gift of the gods.  As with the Greek, Latin, and Romance literatures, Norse bards were inspired by a magical and divine state and then shaped the words with their conscious minds.  Their training was an attempt to learn to shape forces beyond the human.  In the [[Venerable Bede]]'s account of [[Cædmon]], the Christian and later Germanic traditions combine.  Cædmon was a herder with no training or skill at verse.  One night, he had a dream where [[Jesus]] asked him to sing.  He then composed ''[[Cædmon's Hymn]],'' and from then on was a great poet.  Inspiration in the story is the product of [[Divine grace|grace]]: it is unsought (though desired), uncontrolled, and irresistible, and the poet's performance involves his whole mind and body, but it is fundamentally a gift.

===Renaissance revival of ''furor poeticus''===
The Greco-Latin doctrine of the divine origin of poetry was available to medieval authors through the writings of Horace (on [[Orpheus]]) and others, but it was the Latin translations and commentaries by the neo-platonic author [[Marsilio Ficino]] of [[Plato]]'s dialogues ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and (especially) ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' at the end of the 15th century that led to a significant return of the conception of ''furor poeticus''.&lt;ref name=castor&gt;Grahame Castor.  ''Pléiade Poetics: A Study in Sixteenth-Century Thought and Terminology.'' Cambridge University Press: 1964, pp. 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ficino's commentaries explained how gods inspired the poets, and how this frenzy was subsequently transmitted to the poet's auditors through his rhapsodic poetry, allowing the listener to come into contact with the divine through a chain of inspiration.  Ficino himself sought to experience ecstatic rapture in rhapsodic performances of Orphic-Platonic hymns accompanied by a lyre.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. B. Allen.  "Renaissance Neoplatonism."  ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism''.  Vol III: The Renaissance.  Glyn P. Norton, ed.  Cambridge U: 1999, pp. 436-438. {{ISBN|0-521-30008-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine was also an important part of the poetic program of the French Renaissance poets collectively referred to as ''[[La Pléiade]]'' ([[Pierre de Ronsard]], [[Joachim du Bellay]], etc.); a full theory of divine fury / [[enthusiasm]] was elaborated by [[Pontus de Tyard]] in his ''Solitaire Premier, ou Prose des Muses, et de la fureur poétique'' (Tyard classified four kinds of divine inspiration: (1) poetic fury, gift of the Muses; (2) knowledge of religious mysteries, through [[Bacchus]]; (3) prophecy and divination through [[Apollo]]; (4) inspiration brought on by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]/Eros.)&lt;ref name=castor /&gt;
''

===Enlightenment and Romantic models===
In the 18th century in [[England]], nascent [[psychology]] competed with a renascent celebration of the mystical nature of inspiration.  [[John Locke]]'s model of the human mind suggested that ideas associate with one another and that a string in the mind can be struck by a resonant idea.  Therefore, inspiration was a somewhat random but wholly natural association of ideas and sudden unison of thought.  Additionally, Lockean psychology suggested that a natural sense or quality of mind allowed persons to see unity in perceptions and to discern differences in groups.  This "fancy" and "wit," as they were later called, were both natural and developed faculties that could account for greater or lesser insight and inspiration in poets and painters.

The musical model was satirized, along with the ''[[afflatus]],'' and "fancy" models of inspiration, by [[Jonathan Swift]] in ''[[A Tale of a Tub]].''  Swift's narrator suggests that madness is contagious because it is a ringing note that strikes "chords" in the minds of followers and that the difference between an inmate of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]] and an emperor was what pitch the insane idea was.  At the same time, he satirized "inspired" radical [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ministers who preached through "direct inspiration."  In his prefatory materials, he describes the ideal dissenter's pulpit as a barrel with a tube running from the minister's posterior to a set of bellows at the bottom, whereby the minister could be inflated to such an extent that he could shout out his inspiration to the congregation.  Furthermore, Swift saw fancy as an antirational, mad quality, where, "once a man's fancy gets astride his reason, common sense is kick't out of doors."

The divergent theories of inspiration that Swift satirized would continue, side by side, through the 18th and 19th centuries.  [[Edward Young]]'s ''Conjectures on Original Composition'' was pivotal in the formulation of [[Romantic literature|Romantic]] notions of inspiration.  He said that [[genius (literature)|genius]] is "the god within" the poet who provides the inspiration.  Thus, Young agreed with psychologists who were locating inspiration within the personal mind (and significantly away from the realm either of the divine or demonic) and yet still positing a supernatural quality.  Genius was an inexplicable, possibly spiritual and possibly external, font of inspiration.  In Young's scheme, the genius was still somewhat external in its origin, but Romantic poets would soon locate its origin wholly within the poet.  Romantic writers such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (''The Poet''), and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] saw inspiration in terms similar to the Greeks: it was a matter of madness and irrationality.

Inspiration came because the poet tuned himself to the (divine or mystical) "winds" and because he was made in such a way as to receive such visions.  [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s accounts of inspiration were the most dramatic, and his ''[[The Eolian Harp]]'' was only the best of the many poems Romantics would write comparing poetry to a passive reception and natural channelling of the divine winds.  The story he told about the composition of ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' has the poet reduced to the level of scribe.  [[William Butler Yeats]] would later experiment and value [[automatic writing]].  Inspiration was evidence of genius, and genius was a thing that the poet could take pride in, even though he could not claim to have created it himself.

===Modernist and modern concepts===
[[Sigmund Freud]] and other later psychologists located inspiration in the inner psyche of the artist.  The artist's inspiration came out of unresolved psychological conflict or childhood trauma.  Further, inspiration could come directly from the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]].  Like the Romantic genius theory and the revived notion of "poetic phrenzy," Freud saw artists as fundamentally special, and fundamentally wounded.  Because Freud situated inspiration in the unconscious mind, [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists sought out this form of inspiration by turning to dream diaries and automatic writing, the use of [[Ouija boards]] and found poetry to try to tap into what they saw as the true source of art.  [[Carl Gustav Jung]]'s theory of inspiration reiterated the other side of the Romantic notion of inspiration indirectly by suggesting that an artist is one who was attuned to something impersonal, something outside of the individual experience: [[racial memory]].

[[Materialism|Materialist]] theories of inspiration again diverge between purely internal and purely external sources.  [[Karl Marx]] did not treat the subject directly, but the Marxist theory of art sees it as the expression of the friction between economic base and economic superstructural positions, or as an unaware dialog of competing ideologies, or as an exploitation of a "fissure" in the ruling class's ideology.  Therefore, where there have been fully Marxist schools of art, such as [[Soviet Realism]], the "inspired" painter or poet was also the most class-conscious painter or poet, and "[[formalism (art)|formalism]]" was explicitly rejected as decadent (e.g. [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s late films condemned as "formalist error").  Outside of state-sponsored Marxist schools, Marxism has retained its emphasis on the [[class consciousness]] of the inspired painter or poet, but it has made room for what [[Frederic Jameson]] called a ''"political unconscious"'' that might be present in the artwork.  However, in each of these cases, inspiration comes from the artist being particularly attuned to receive the signals from an external crisis.

In modern psychology, inspiration is not frequently studied, but it is generally seen as an entirely internal process.  In each view, however, whether empiricist or mystical, inspiration is, by its nature, beyond control. 

An example of a modern study on inspiration is one that was conducted by Takeshi Okada and Kentaro Ishibashi, published in 2016 in the multidisciplinary journal, ''[[Cognitive Science (journal)|Cognitive Science]].''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okada|first=Takeshi|last2=Ishibashi|first2=Kentaro|date=2017-09-01|title=Imitation, Inspiration, and Creation: Cognitive Process of Creative Drawing by Copying Others' Artworks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12442/abstract|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=41|issue=7|pages=1804–1837|doi=10.1111/cogs.12442|issn=1551-6709}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this three-part study, groups of Japanese undergraduate art students were observed to determine whether copying or simply musing upon example artworks that served as their inspiration would increase their creative output. The results of the first and second experiment revealed that copying artwork enabled the students to produce creative drawings that were qualitatively different, but only when the example—the inspiration—featured a style that was unfamiliar to the students. The third experiment revealed that only musing upon the unfamiliar inspiration produced the same effect as copying it. Okada and Ishibashi suggest that these unfamiliar examples were able to facilitate the creativity of the students because they challenged the students' perspectives on drawing. They admit, however, that it is unclear whether their results can be generalized to professional artists as well, but they cite examples of artists, namely [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]], who extensively imitated the work of other artists, which might suggest that "imitation is an effective driver of creativity, even for experts."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types. There is [[academia|academic]] criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals, then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature (often called 'a [[review]]') which is seen by a wider public through newspapers, television and radio. The academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic, the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The '''Baghdad School''' was a relatively short-lived yet influential school of [[Islamic art]] developed during the late 12th century in the capital [[Baghdad]] of the ruling [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The movement had largely died out by the early 14th century, five decades following the invasion of the [[Mongols]] in 1258 and the downfall of the Abbasids' rule, and would eventually be replaced by stylistic movements from the [[Mongol]] tradition.  The Baghdad School is particularly noted for its distinctive approach to manuscript illustration.  The faces depicted in illustrations were individualized and expressive, with the scenes often highlighting realistic features of everyday life from the period.  This stylistic movement used strong, bright colors, and employed a balanced sense of design and a decorative quality, with illustrations often lacking traditional frames and appearing between lines of text on manuscript pages.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v. "Baghdad school," accessed May 04, 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48804/Baghdad-school.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Baghdad School of art is noted for its manuscript artwork. The school consisted of calligraphers, illustrators, transcribers and translators, who collaborated to produce illuminated manuscripts derived from non-Arabic sources. The characteristic Baghdad School artistic style, which features sprightly characters bearing highly expressive faces and hand gestures (rather than stereotypical people), reached its peak in the first half of the 13th-century, although some examples can be identified at earlier periods.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad School," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., CRC Press, 2003, p. 1259&lt;/ref&gt;  Illustrations in this style represent a skilful blend of Byzantine, Persian and Arab features.&lt;ref&gt;Ekhtiar, M., ''Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' New York, N.Y., [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2011, p. 94; Ipşiroğlu, M.S., ''Painting and Culture of the Mongols,'' Abrams, 1966, p. 37; Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Very few illuminated copies of the [[Quaran|Q'ran]] from this period have survived, but a number of secular manuscripts are still extant.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., [[CRC Press]], 2003, p. 1259.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts are primarily scientific treatises or social commentaries. 

The descriptor, "Baghdad School", was coined by the French [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], Eustache De Lorey, in 1938, when he curated an exhibition of illustrations from ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani]]'' for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Some art historians and curators used the term, ''Mesopotamian School,''&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin,'' n.d.,  p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1930, pp 18-20 or Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars have suggested that the term should be replaced with something broader, such as the Arab School of Miniatures, because its exponents were not just confined to Baghdad and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Osier, P., ''Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and illustrations of ''[[De Materia Medica]]''==

The [[Greeks|Greek]] [[materia medica]], in particular herbals and [[bestiaries]], which described the characteristics and medicinal uses of various plants and animals found in the Mediterranean world, were among the books transcribed.&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;“Preparation of Medicine from Honey: Leaf from an Arabic Translation of the Materia Medica of Dioscorides [Iraq, Baghdad School] (13.152.6)”. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000--. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/13.152.6 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several Arabic translations of [[Dioscorides]]' work, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' have been discovered. [[Dioscorides]]' treatise was considered especially important, and remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;

Of these, a manuscript known as the ''Mashhad Manuscript'', originally believed to be 13th-century  work, has been reassessed and now dated to between 1152 and 1176, providing one of the earliest examples of illustrations in the style of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref&gt;Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has no colophon with date, but it has a 4-page introduction written by Mihran ibn Mansur ibn Miihran, who translated it for Najm ad-din Alpi, the Urtuqid prince, ruler from 1152 to 1176.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of these translations is the translation and work probably by Abdallah ibn al-Fadl.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, M., ''New Accessions of Islamic Art,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257747.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d., p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has a colophon which establishes the date as the month of Rajab 620 A.H./ July-August 1224&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations were considered especially important, and it remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;  [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned Greek physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt; 

Among the illustrated manuscript leaves of the 13th-century [[Dioscorides]]' ''Materia Medica'' is the page entitled, “Physician Preparing an Elixir," also referred to by The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History as “Preparation of Medicine from Honey.”  It is dated 1224 CE and was found in [[Iraq]] or Northern Jazira, possibly [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;  The page depicts an illustration of a bearded physician with a colorful blue headscarf and red clothing seated on an ornamental stool.  He is mixing a yellow pot with a ladle while overlooking a yellow cauldron hanging from a red tripod above a wide blue container.  His other hand is raised up towards his mouth.  A large blue jug lies to the left of the tripod.  Two overhanging trees on either side of the scene bear leaves and two different types of what appear to be colorful fruit or flowers—red on the left and yellow on the right.  The ground below the scene is covered with green grass, however there is no background depicted in the illustration thus reducing the sense of depth. The style of illustration depicted on this manuscript leaf is thus an excellent example of the Baghdad School: the colors are bright and distinctive, the objects depicted in the scene have a balanced, symmetrical design with the trees framing the illustration, and finally, the man’s face appears to be in a state of deep, expressive contemplation.  The scene itself has a realistic and personalized quality to it, depicting a physician in a natural setting as he prepares a medicinal mixture containing honey for his patients, and yet also has ornamental characteristics with its design and choice of colors—another distinctive feature of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

==Transcription and illustration of ''Maqamat''==
The Abbasid artist, [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]], who lived in [[Baghdad]] in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th-centuries), was one of the pre-eminent exponents of the Baghdad school. In 1236-37, he is known to have transcribed and illustrated the book, ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (also known as the ''Assemblies'' or the ''Sessions''), a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative concerns the travels of a middle-aged man as he uses his charm and eloquence to swindle his way across the Arabic world.&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works ==
[[File:Two men talking. An image from Kalila wa Dimna.jpg|thumb|''Two men talking'' from ''Kalila wa Dimna,'' c. 1222]]

Yet other examples of work in the style of the Baghdad School include the illustrations in ''Kalila wa Dimna'' ([[Panchatantra|Fables of Bidpai]]), (1222); a collection of fables by the Hindu, Bidpai translated into Arabic ,&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., CRC Press, 2003, p. 1259; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1930, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rasa'il al-Ikhwan al-Safa'' (The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren) (1287); an example of an illuminated manuscript produced after the Mongol invasion.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]; Brend, B., ''Islamic Art,'' [[Harvard University Press]], 1991, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the 20th-century, al-Waiti's illustrations and the Baghdad School served as an inspiration for [[Iraqi art#Jama’et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|The Baghdad Modern Art Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,'' p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the 1950s by artists, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], members of the group believed that the Mongol invasion of the 13th-century represented a "break in the chain of pictorial Iraqi art"&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted to reassert a national identity and build a distinctive Iraqi identity which referenced heritage and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]], 1991, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; As the leader of the group, Saleem promoted the idea of ''istilham al-turath'' – "seeking inspiration from tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shabout | first=N. | chapter=Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism | title=Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World | url=http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blog fiction''' is a form of blogging that can be defined as any forms of narrative written and published through online web journals such as LiveJournal. Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, AA, Fictional Blogs, Uses of Blogs, Peter Lang, Bruns, A &amp; Jacobs, J (ed), New York, pp. 199-210. {{ISBN|0820481246}} (2006) [Research Book Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.mga.edu/eds/ebookviewer/ebook?sid=9590c575-d91b-46ef-a66d-65d75126b5d6@sessionmgr102&amp;ppid=Page-__-107&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EK {{full citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Readers generally cannot access the university proxy link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as "a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper." Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commforum.mit.edu/hypertext-in-historical-context-vannevar-bush-and-ted-nelson-revisited-bc527272125|title=Hypertext in Historical Context: Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson Revisited|date=30 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake or real blogs==
Fictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. 

Fake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch [[scareware]] and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scambusters.org/fakeblog.html|title=8 Clues That Point to a Fake Blog.html|website=www.scambusters.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Real blog fiction===

Fictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogbasics.com/what-is-a-blog/|title=What Is a Blog? - Blog Basics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]], which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best "blook" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and "official" status in the world of fiction and academia. 

Some people{{who|date=December 2017}} say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.

In the arts, '''bricolage''' ([[French language|French]] for "[[DIY]]" or "do-it-yourself projects") is the construction or creation of a work from a diverse range of things that happen to be available, or a work created by mixed media.

The term ''bricolage'' has also been used in many other fields, including [[anthropology]], philosophy, critical theory, education, computer software, and business.

==Origin==
''Bricolage'' is a French [[loanword]] that means the process of [[improvisation]] in a human endeavor. The word is derived from the French verb ''bricoler'' ("to tinker"), with the English term [[DIY]] ("Do-it-yourself") being the closest equivalent of the contemporary French usage. In both languages, ''bricolage'' also denotes any works or products of DIY endeavors.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |last= Baldick |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Baldick |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn= 9780199208272 |page=42 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=dictionary%20of&amp;pg=PA42 |accessdate=29 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broady&gt;{{Cite book |title=Colloquial French 2: The Next step in Language Learning |last=Broady |first=Elspeth |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-26647-5 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JM2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==

===Music===
Instrumental bricolage in music includes the use of [[found object]]s as instruments, such as:

*[[Spoon (musical instrument)|Spoons]]
*[[Musical saw]]
*Australasian [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]] made from a [[tea chest]]
*Comb and wax paper for [[humming]] through
*[[eucalyptus|Gumleaf]] humming
*[[Lagerphone]] (made from a stick and bottle tops)
*[[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[steelpan|steel drums]] (made from [[drum (container)|industrial storage drums]])
*[[African drums]] and [[thumb piano]]s made from recycled pots and pans.
*American super instruments made from recorders and bicycle bells or metal rods and keys
*[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp dancing]] is an example of the use of bricolage in music and dance, utilizing everyday objects, such as trash cans and broom sticks, to produce music.
*Many of the musical instruments created by American composer [[Harry Partch]] utilize unusual items, such as automotive [[hubcap]]s and [[pyrex]] [[carboy]]s.

Stylistic bricolage is the inclusion of common musical devices with new uses.  Shuker writes, "Punk best emphasized such stylistic bricolage".&lt;ref&gt;Shuker ''Popular Music: Key Concepts'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical bricolage flourishes in music of sub-cultures where: 
*experimentation is part of daily life (pioneers, immigrants, artistic communities),
*access to resources is limited (such as in remote, discriminated or financially disconnected sub-cultures) which limits commercial influence (e.g. acoustic performers, ghetto music, hippie, folk or traditional musicians), and
*there is a political or social drive to seek individuality (e.g. rap music, peace-drives, drummers' circles)

Unlike other bricolage fields, the intimate knowledge of resources is not necessary. Many punk musicians, for instance, are not musically trained, because they believe training can discourage creativity in preference for accuracy. Also, careful observation and listening is not necessary, it is common in spontaneous music to welcome 'errors' and disharmony. Like other bricolage fields, bricolage music still values trusting one's ideas and self-correcting structures such as targeted audiences.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Visual art===
In art, bricolage is a technique or creative mode, where works are constructed from various materials available or on hand, and is seen as a characteristic of many [[postmodern]] works.

These materials may be [[mass-produced]] or "junk". See also: [[Kurt Schwitters|Merz]], [[polystylism]], [[collage]], [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]].

Bricolage can also be applied to [[Improvisational theatre|theatrical forms of improvisation]], where the main strategy is to use the environment and materials at hand. The environment is the stage and the materials are often pantomimed. The use of the stage and the imaginary materials are all made up on the spot, so the materials which are at hand are actually things that the players know from past experiences (i.e. an improvisation of ordering fast food: One player would start with the common phrase "How may I help you?").

Bricolage is also applied in [[interior design]], through blending styles and accessorizing spaces with what is "on hand". Many designers use bricolage to come up with innovative and unique ideas.

===Architecture===
Bricolage is considered the jumbled effect produced by the close proximity of buildings from different periods and in different architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bricolage |title=bricolage - definition of bricolage by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a term that is admiringly applied to the architectural work of [[Le Corbusier]], by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book ''Collage City'', suggesting that he assembled ideas from found objects of the [[history of architecture]]. This, in contrast to someone like [[Mies Van der Rohe]], whom they called a "hedgehog", for being overly focused on a narrow concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Academics==

===Literature===
In literature, bricolage is affected by [[intertextuality]], the shaping of a text's meanings by reference to other texts.

===Cultural studies===
In [[cultural studies]] bricolage is used to mean the processes by which people acquire objects from across [[social division]]s to create new [[cultural identity|cultural identities]]. In particular, it is a feature of [[subculture]]s such as the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement. Here, objects that possess one meaning (or no meaning) in the dominant culture are acquired and given a new, often subversive meaning. For example, the [[safety pin]] became a form of decoration in punk culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hebdige, Dick. ''Subculture: the Meaning of Style.'' London: Routledge, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology&lt;!--linked from 'Claude Lévi-Strauss'--&gt;===
The term "psychological bricolage" is used to explain the mental processes through which an individual develops novel solutions to problems by making use of previously unrelated knowledge or ideas they already possess.

The first, “social bricolage,” was introduced by cultural anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in 1962. Lévi-Strauss was interested in how societies create novel solutions by using resources that already exist in the collective social consciousness. The second, "creative cognition,” is an intra-psychic approach to studying how individuals retrieve and recombine knowledge in new ways.  Psychological bricolage, therefore, refers to the cognitive processes that enable individuals to retrieve and recombine previously unrelated knowledge they already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Karlesky, M., &amp; Lee, F. "Psychological Bricolage, Integrating social identities to produce creative solutions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Shalley, M. Hitt, &amp; J. Zhou. Oxford Handbook of Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychological bricolage is an intra-individual process akin to [[Karl E. Weick]]’s notion of bricolage in organizations, which is akin to Lévi-Strauss' notion of bricolage in societies.&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Karl Weick, "Organizational Redesign as Improvisation", reprinted in ''Making Sense of the Organization''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
In his book ''[[The Savage Mind]]'' (1962, English translation 1966), French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] used  "bricolage" to describe the characteristic patterns of mythological thought. In his description it is opposed to the engineers' creative thinking, which proceeds from goals to means. Mythical thought, according to Lévi-Strauss, attempts to re-use available materials in order to solve new problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Lévi-Strauss |title=La Pensée sauvage |location=Paris |year=1962 }} English translation as ''The Savage Mind'' (Chicago, 1966). {{ISBN|0-226-47484-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |title=Bricolage [Tesugen&amp;#93; |publisher=Tesugen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035434/http://tesugen.com/archives/03/08/bricolage |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varenne.tc.columbia.edu/bib/info/levstcld066savamind.html |title=Varenne: quotes from Lévi-Strauss (1963 [1962&amp;#93;) |publisher=Varenne.tc.columbia.edu |date=1999-05-11 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] extends this notion to any discourse. "If one calls ''bricolage'' the necessity of borrowing one's concept from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is ''bricoleur''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacques |last=Derrida |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |url=http://hydra.humanities.uci.edu/derrida/sign-play.html |title=Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences |publisher=Hydra.humanities.uci.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], in their 1972 book ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]'', identify ''bricolage'' as the characteristic [[mode of production]] of the schizophrenic producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Anti-Œdipus|Anti-Oedipus]]: Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. Trans. Robert Hurley, Mark Seem, and Helen R. Lane. Continuum edition. London: Continuum, 2004 (1972). p.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In the discussion of [[Constructionism_(learning_theory)|constructionism]], [[Seymour Papert]] discusses two styles of solving problems. Contrary to the analytical style of solving problems, he describes bricolage as a way to learn and solve problems by trying, testing, playing around.

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] and [[Shirley R. Steinberg]] have used the term bricolage in educational research to denote the use of multiperspectival research methods. In Kincheloe's conception of the research bricolage, diverse theoretical traditions are employed in a broader critical theoretical/critical pedagogical context to lay the foundation for a transformative mode of multimethodological inquiry. Using these multiple frameworks and methodologies, researchers are empowered to produce more rigorous and praxiological insights into socio-political and educational phenomena.

Kincheloe and Steinberg theorize a critical multilogical epistemology and critical connected ontology to ground the research bricolage. These philosophical notions provide the research bricolage with a sophisticated understanding of the complexity of knowledge production and the interrelated complexity of both researcher positionality and phenomena in the world. Such complexity demands a more rigorous mode of research that is capable of dealing with the complications of socio-educational experience. Such a critical form of rigor avoids the reductionism of many monological, mimetic research orientations (see Kincheloe, 2001, 2005; Kincheloe &amp; Berry, 2004; Steinberg, 2015; Kincheloe, McLaren, &amp; Steinberg, 2012).

==Information technology==

===Information systems===
In [[information systems]], bricolage is used by [[Claudio Ciborra]] to describe the way in which [[strategic information system]]s (SIS) can be built in order to maintain successful [[competitive advantage]] over a longer period of time than standard SIS. By valuing tinkering and allowing SIS to evolve from the bottom-up, rather than implementing it from the top-down, the firm will end up with something that is deeply rooted in the [[organisational culture]] that is specific to that firm and is much less easily imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Ciborra, Claudio (1992). "From Thinking to Tinkering: The Grassroots of Strategic Information Systems", ''The Information Society'' 8, 297–309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
In her book ''[[Life on the Screen]]'' (1995), [[Sherry Turkle]] discusses the concept of bricolage as it applies to problem solving in code projects and workspace productivity.  She advocates the "bricoleur style" of programming as a valid and underexamined alternative to what she describes as the conventional structured "planner" approach.  In this style of coding, the programmer works without an exhaustive preliminary specification, opting instead for a step-by-step growth and re-evaluation process.  In her essay "Epistemological Pluralism", Turkle writes: "The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turkle |first=Sherry |url=http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html |title=Epistemological Pluralism |publisher=Papert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==
The visual arts is a field in which individuals often integrate a variety of knowledge sets in order to produce inventive work. To reach this stage, artists read print materials across a wide array of disciplines, as well as information from their own social identities.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbledick, Susie. "Information-Seeking Behavior of Artists: Exploratory Interviews."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the artist [[Shirin Neshat]] has integrated her identities as an Iranian exile and a woman in order to make complex, creative and critical bodies of work.&lt;ref&gt;2010 TED Talk, "Shirin Neshat: Art in Exile."&lt;/ref&gt; This willingness to integrate diverse knowledge sets enables artists with multiple identities to fully leverage their knowledge sets. This is demonstrated by Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Chi-Ying Chen and Fiona Lee, who found that individuals were shown to exhibit greater levels of innovation in tasks related to their cultural identities when they successfully integrated those identities.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez-Burks, J., Cheng, C. &amp; Lee, F. "Increasing Innovation Through Identity Integration."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[Karl Weick]] identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage in organizations.&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;
 
*Intimate knowledge of resources
*Careful observation and listening
*Trusting one's ideas
*Self-correcting structures, with feedback

Nasim Nicholas Taleb mentions it in his book ''[[Antifragile]]''.

==In popular culture==

===Fashion===
In his essay "Subculture: The Meaning of Style", [[Dick Hebdige]] discusses how an individual can be identified as a bricoleur when they "appropriated another range of commodities by placing them in a symbolic ensemble which served to erase or subvert their original straight meanings".&lt;ref&gt;"Subculture: The Meaning of Style". Dick Hebdige. In ''Cultural Studies: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael Ryan. 2008. p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion industry uses bricolage-like styles by incorporating items typically utilized for other purposes. For example, candy wrappers are woven together to produce a purse. The movie ''[[Zoolander]]'' parodies this concept with "Derelicte", a line of clothing made from trash.

===Television===
* ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' is a television series in which the protagonist is the paragon of a bricoleur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Bogost |title=Comparative Video Game Criticism |url=http://gac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/41 |work= [[Games and Culture]] |volume= 1, No. 1 |pages=41–46 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating solutions for the problem to be solved out of immediately available found objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3018">'''Buon Fresco''' '''Affresco''',&lt;ref&gt;Dizionario Italiano&lt;/ref&gt; Italian for '''''true fresco''''', is a [[fresco]] [[painting]] technique in which alkaline-resistant [[pigment]]s, ground in water, are applied to wet [[plaster]].

It is distinguished from the [[fresco-secco]] (or ''a secco'') and [[finto fresco]] techniques, in which paints are applied to dried plaster.

==Description==
The buon fresco technique consists of painting with pigment ground in [[water]] on a thin layer of wet, fresh, [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]], for which the Italian word is , [[intonaco]]. Because of the chemical makeup of the plaster, a [[Binder (material)|binder]] is not required.

After a number of hours the plaster reacts with the air in a process called [[carbonatation]]. This chemical reaction fixes the pigment particles at the plaster's surface in a protective crystalline mesh known as the lime crust.&lt;ref&gt;Fresco Painting: The Dichotomy of Rigorous Craft and Artistic Expression, Tessa Lindsey&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of '''Buon fresco''' is its durability.  In ''[[fresco-secco]]'', by contrast, the color does not become part of the wall and tends to flake off over time.  The chief disadvantage of '''Buon fresco''' is that it must be done quickly without mistakes.

The painter plasters and paints only as much as can be completed in a day, which explains the Italian term for each of these sections, ''[[giornata]]'', or a day's work.  The size of a [[giornata]] varies according to the complexity of the painting within it.  A face, for instance, might take an entire day, whereas large areas of sky can be painted quite rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Frescoes dating from the 17th century BC using this technique have been found n the excavations of [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island of [[Santorini]] in [[Greece]], changing our beliefs about art in prehistoric times.

One of the first painters in the post-classical period to use this technique was the Isaac Master in the Upper [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in [[Assisi]].

In medieval and Renaissance Italy, a wall to be frescoed was first prepared with a rough, thick undercoat of plaster known as the arriccio.  When this was dry, assistants copied the master painter's composition onto it with reddish-brown pigment or charcoal.  The artist made any necessary adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ceramic glaze''' is an impervious layer or coating of a [[vitreous enamel|vitreous]] substance which has been fused to a [[ceramic]] body through firing. Glaze can serve to color, decorate or waterproof an item.&lt;ref name="Division"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics of U.S. Businesses Main Page|url = https://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|website = www.census.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = EN-US|first = Company Statistics|last = Division|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126030511/http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|archive-date = 2015-11-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glazing renders [[earthenware]] vessels suitable for holding liquids, sealing the inherent [[porosity]] of unglazed [[biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]] earthenware. It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]]. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.

Most [[pottery]] produced in recent centuries has been glazed, other than pieces in unglazed [[terracotta]], [[biscuit porcelain]] or some other types. [[Tile]]s are almost always glazed on the surface face, and modern [[architectural terracotta]] is very often [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]].  Glazed brick is also common.  Domestic sanitary ware is invariably glazed, as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for [[overhead power line]]s.

The most important groups of traditional glazes, named after their main [[ceramic flux]]ing agent, are:

*[[Lead-glazed earthenware]], is shiny and transparent after firing, which needs only about {{convert|800|C}}.  It has been used for about 2,000 years around the Mediterranean, in Europe, and China. It includes ''[[sancai]]'' and [[Victorian majolica]].
*[[Tin-glazed pottery]], which coats the ware with an opaque white glaze. Known in the [[Ancient Near East]] and then important in [[Islamic pottery]], from which it passed to Europe. Includes [[faience]], [[maiolica]], [[majolica]] and [[Delftware]].   
*[[Salt glaze pottery|Salt-glazed ware]], mostly European stoneware. It uses ordinary salt.
*[[Ash glaze]], important in East Asia, simply made from wood or plant ash, which contains [[potash]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. 
*[[Feldspath]]ic glazes of porcelain.

Modern [[materials technology]] has invented new vitreous glazes that do not fall into these traditional categories.

==Composition==
Glazes need to include a [[ceramic flux]] which functions by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other glaze materials. Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers [[silica]], and sometimes [[boron trioxide]].  These glass formers may be included in the glaze materials, or may be drawn from the clay beneath. 
 
Raw materials of ceramic glazes generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]], act as [[ceramic flux|flux]] and therefore lower the melting temperature. [[Alumina]], often derived from [[clay]], stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CsrDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=%C2%A0Raw+materials+of+ceramic+glazes+generally+include+silica,+which+will+be+the+main+glass+forme#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Raw%20materials%20of%20ceramic%20glazes%20generally%20include%20silica,%20which%20will%20be%20the%20main%20glass%20forme&amp;f=false|title=S.Chands Success Guide (Q&amp;A) Inorganic Chemistry|last=Madan|first=Gaurav|date=2005|publisher=S. Chand Publishing|isbn=9788121918572|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorants, such as [[iron oxide]], [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]], or [[cobalt carbonate]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and sometimes opacifiers like [[tin oxide]] or [[zirconium oxide]], are used to modify the visual appearance of the fired glaze.

==Process==
[[File:Enderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|thumb|[[İznik tiles]] in the [[Enderûn Library]], [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]]]]
Glaze may be applied by dry-dusting a dry mixture over the surface of the clay body or by inserting salt or soda into the kiln at high temperatures to create an atmosphere rich in sodium vapor that interacts with the aluminium and silica oxides in the body to form and deposit glass, producing what is known as [[salt glaze pottery]]. Most commonly, glazes in aqueous suspension of various powdered [[mineral]]s and metal [[oxide]]s are applied by dipping pieces directly into the glaze. Other techniques include pouring the glaze over the piece, spraying it onto the piece with an [[airbrush]] or similar tool, or applying it directly with a brush or other tool.

To prevent the glazed article from sticking to the [[kiln]] during firing, either a small part of the item is left unglazed, or it's supported on small refractory supports such as [[kiln spurs]] and [[Stilt (ceramics)|Stilt]]s that are removed and discarded after the firing. Small marks left by these spurs are sometimes visible on finished ware.

Decoration applied under the glaze on pottery is generally referred to as [[underglaze]]. Underglazes are applied to the surface of the pottery, which can be either raw, "greenware", or "[[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]"-fired (an initial firing of some articles before the glazing and re-firing).&lt;ref&gt;"Cleaning Biscuit Fired Ceramic Ware" Hulse D.K, Barnett W.C.

The pigment fuses with the glaze, and appears to be underneath a layer of clear glaze. An example of underglaze decoration is the well-known "[[Blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]" [[porcelain]] famously produced in [[Spode|England]], [[Delftware|the Netherlands]], China, and [[Imari porcelain|Japan]].

''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Polychrome glazed pottery statue of heavenly guardian.jpg|thumb|[[Sancai]] lead-glazed figure of heavenly guardian, [[Tang dynasty]]]]

Decoration applied on top of a layer of glaze is referred to as [[overglaze]]. Overglaze methods include applying one or more layers or coats of glaze on a piece of [[pottery]] or by applying a non-glaze substance such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or metals (e.g., [[gold leaf]]) over the glaze.

Overglaze colors are low-temperature glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing being called the '''glost firing''', then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and comes out of the kiln, its texture is smoother due to the glaze.

==History==
Historically, glazing of ceramics developed rather slowly, as appropriate materials needed to be discovered, and also firing technology able to reliably reach the necessary temperatures was needed.

Glazed brick goes back to the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC.  The [[Iron Pagoda]], built in 1049 in [[Kaifeng]], [[China]], of glazed bricks is a well-known later example.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite book

Lead glazed earthenware was probably made in China during the Warring States Period (475 – 221 BCE), and its production increased during the Han Dynasty. High temperature proto-celadon glazed stoneware was made earlier than glazed earthenware, since the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE).  &lt;ref name="Zhiyan"&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Kofun period]] of Japan, [[Sue ware]] was decorated with greenish natural [[ash glaze]]s. From 552 to 794 AD, differently colored glazes were introduced. The three colored glazes of the [[Tang Dynasty]] were frequently used for a period, but were gradually phased out; the precise colors and compositions of the glazes have not been recovered. Natural ash glaze, however, was commonly used throughout the country.

In the 13th century, flower designs were painted with red, blue, green, yellow and black overglazes. Overglazes became very popular because of the particular look they gave [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].

From the eighth century, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic pottery]], usually in the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref name="Environment"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/publications/factsheet-nitrogen-dioxide-no2|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Department of the|last = Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative ceramic pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref name="Missoun, F. 2010"&gt;Missoun, F., M.

Metals used in ceramic glazes are typically in the form of metal oxides.

==== Lead(II) oxide ====
Ceramic manufacturers primarily use [[lead(II) oxide]] (PbO) as a flux for its low melting range, wide firing range, low surface tension, high index of refraction, and resistance to [[devitrification]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lehman, Richard. ''Lead Glazes for Ceramic Foodware''. 1st ed. Research Triangle Park: International Lead Management Center, 2002. [http://www.ilmc.org/Publications/ILMCFinalCombo8-02B.pdf  International Lead Management Center  ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In polluted environments, [[nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) to produce [[nitrous acid]] ({{chem|HNO|2}}) and [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2{{chem|NO|2}} → {{chem|HNO|2}} + {{chem|HNO|3}}

Soluble [[Lead(II) nitrate]] ({{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}}) forms when lead(II) oxide (PbO) of leaded glazes is exposed to [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}) 

PbO + 2{{chem|HNO|3}} → {{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Because lead exposure is strongly linked to a variety of health problems, collectively referred to as [[lead poisoning]], the disposal of leaded glass (chiefly in the form of discarded CRT displays) and lead-glazed ceramics is subject to [[toxic waste]] regulations.

==== Chromium(III) oxide ====
[[Chromium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Cr|2|O|3}}) is used as a colorant in ceramic glazes. Chromium(III) oxide can undergo a reaction with [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) and atmospheric oxygen in temperatures reached by a kiln to produce [[calcium chromate]] ({{chem|CaCrO|4}}). The oxidation reaction changes chromium from its +3 [[oxidation state]] to its +6 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heating Temperature Dependence of Cr(III) Oxidation in the Presence of Alkali and Alkaline Earth Salts and Subsequent Cr(VI) Leaching Behavior|journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date = 2013-06-04|issn = 0013-936X|pages = 5858–5863|volume = 47|issue = 11|doi = 10.1021/es4001455|pmid = 23635007|first = Bram|last = Verbinnen|first2 = Pieter|last2 = Billen|first3 = Michiel|last3 = Van Coninckxloo|first4 = Carlo|last4 = Vandecasteele}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(VI) is very soluble and the most mobile out of all the other stable forms of chromium.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chromium as an Environmental Pollutant: Insights on Induced Plant Toxicity|journal = Journal of Botany|date = 2012-05-20|pages = 1–8|volume = 2012|doi = 10.1155/2012/375843|first = Helena|last = Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chem|Cr|2|O|3}} + 2CaO + {{frac|3|2}}{{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|CaCrO|4}}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Chromium may enter water systems via industrial discharge. Chromium(VI) can enter the environment directly or oxidants present in soils can react with chromium(III) to produce chromium(VI). Plants have reduced amounts of chlorophyll when grown in the presence of chromium(VI).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Prevention ===
Chromium oxidation during manufacturing processes can be reduced with the introduction of compounds that bind to calcium.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ceramic industries are reluctant to use lead alternatives since leaded glazes provide products with a brilliant shine and smooth surface. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has experimented with a dual glaze, barium alternative to lead, but they were unsuccessful in achieving the same optical effect as leaded glazes.

[[File:Fairy Tales (Boston Public Library).jpg|thumb|A mother reads to her children, depicted by [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] in a cover illustration of a volume of fairy tales written in the mid to late 19th century.]]
[[File:Pinocchio.jpg|thumb|''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' (1883) is a canonical piece of children's literature and [[List of best-selling books|one of the best-selling books]] ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[...]remains the most translated Italian book and, after the Bible, the most widely read[...] by Francelia Butler, ''Children's Literature'',

'''Children's literature''' or '''juvenile literature''' includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.

Children's literature can be traced to stories and songs, part of a wider [[oral tradition]], that adults shared with children before publishing existed. The development of early children's literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace. Even after printing became widespread, many classic "children's" tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience. Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children, often with a moral or religious message. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is known as the "Golden Age of Children's Literature", because many classic children's books were published then.

== Introduction ==
There is no single or widely used definition of children's literature.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|15–17}} It can be broadly defined as anything that children read&lt;ref name=nodel&gt;{{cite book|last=Nodelman|first=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|year= 2008|publisher= [[JHU]]|page=4| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wKosfJZhUwQC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-8018-8980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more specifically defined as [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[poetry]], or [[drama]] intended for and used by children and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress|title=Children's Literature|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/devpol/chi.pdf|work=LIbrary of Congress Collections Policy Statement|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20thc&gt;{{cite book|last= Chevalier|first= Tracy|title=Twentieth-Century Children's Writers|year=1989|publisher=[[St. James Press]]|location= [[Chicago]]|isbn= 0-912289-95-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvii}} One writer on children's literature defines it as "all books written for children, excluding works such as [[comic book]]s, joke books, [[cartoon book]]s, and non-fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference materials".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2006, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others would argue that comics should also be included: "Children's Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children".&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, C. "Abstract":, "Comic Art, Children's Literature, and the New Comic Studies." ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', vol. 30 no. 3, 2006, pp. 360-382. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/uni.2006.0031 [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202582/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'' notes that "the boundaries of [[genre]]&amp;nbsp;... are not fixed but blurred".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first= Peter (editor)|title= International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P74RiK3CRGkC&amp;pg=PP4|isbn= 978-0-203-16812-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Sometimes, no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children. Some works defy easy categorization. [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series was written and marketed for young adults, but it is also popular among adults. The series' extreme popularity led ''[[The New York Times]]'' to create a separate best-seller list for children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|title=The ''Times'' Plans a Children's Best-Seller List|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 24, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/books/the-times-plans-a-children-s-best-seller-list.html|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread association of children's literature with picture books, spoken narratives existed before [[printing]], and the root of many children's tales go back to ancient storytellers.&lt;ref name=Arbuth&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbuthnot|first=May Hill|title=Children and Books|year=1964|publisher=[[Scott, Foresman Publishers|Scott, Foresman]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} [[Seth Lerer]], in the opening of ''Children's Literature: A Reader's History from Aesop to Harry Potter'', says, "This book presents a history of what children have heard and read&amp;nbsp;... The history I write of is a history of ''reception''."&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|2}}

== History ==
&lt;!--Note to future editors: This should not be a list of books published but an encyclopedic summary of significant advances and changes around the world. Please keep this from becoming a mere list. See note on talk page for order of information for this section--&gt;
Early children's literature consisted of spoken stories, songs, and poems that were used to educate, instruct, and entertain children.&lt;ref name=random&gt;{{cite web|title=To Instruct and Delight A History of Children's Literature| url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/024children.html|publisher=Randon History|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was only in the eighteenth century, with the development of the concept of childhood, that a separate genre of children's literature began to emerge, with its own divisions, expectations, and [[Western canon|canon]].&lt;ref name=nikola&gt;{{cite book|last= Nikolajeva|first= María (editor) |author-link=Maria Nikolajeva |title= Aspects and Issues in the History of Children's Literature|year= 1995|publisher= Greenwood| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ubZL9V1L9fEC&amp;pg=PR9|isbn= 978-0-313-29614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x-xi}} The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs--often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters. &lt;ref&gt;•Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, French historian [[Philippe Ariès]] argues in his book ''[[Centuries of Childhood]]'' that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment.&lt;ref name=shav&gt;{{cite book|last= Shavit|first= Zohar|title= Poetics of Children's Literature|year= 2009|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8203-3481-3| url=https://books.google.com/?id=NerYSgnlnaIC&amp;pg=PP10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} As evidence for this position, he notes that, apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by [[cleric]]s like [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] and [[Ælfric of Eynsham]], there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMunn|first=Meradith Tilbury|author2=William Robert McMunn|title=Children's Literature in the Middle Ages|journal=[[Children's Literature (journal)|Children's Literature]]|year=1972|volume= 1|pages=21| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chl/summary/v001/1.mcmunn.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|doi=10.1353/chl.0.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brad&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Johanna|title=From Chapbooks to Plumb Cake: The History of Children's Literature|year=2007|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|isbn=978-0-549-34070-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=65KJo_XpLoYC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

Other scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values, attitudes, and information necessary for children within their cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Wyile|first= Andrea Schwenke (editor)|title=Considering Children's Literature: A Reader|year=2008|publisher=Broadview|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MWTY0BK5jbIC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ''[[Play of Daniel]]'' from the 12th century.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;ref name=kline&gt;{{cite book|last= Kline|first= Daniel T.|title= Medieval Literature for Children|year= 2003|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8153-3312-8| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TcxBsWXg9mYC&amp;pg=PR4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Pre-modern children's literature, therefore, tended to be of a [[didactic]] and [[Morality|moralistic]] nature, with the purpose of conveying [[Conduct book|conduct]]-related, educational and [[Religious book|religious]] lessons.&lt;ref name=kline /&gt;{{rp|6–8}}

=== Early-modern Europe ===
[[File:Hornbook Mexican.png|left|thumb|An early Mexican [[hornbook]] pictured in Tuer's ''History of the Horn-Book'', 1896.]]
During the 17th century, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them.&lt;ref name=shav /&gt;{{rp|6–7}}&lt;ref name=reynolds&gt;{{cite book|last= Reynolds|first= Kimberley|title= Children's Literature: A Very Short Introduction|year=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The English philosopher [[John Locke]] developed his theory of the [[tabula rasa]] in his 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.  In Locke's philosophy, ''tabula rasa'' was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a "blank slate" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's [[sense|sensory]] experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with "easy pleasant books" to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them; "children may be cozen'd into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipp'd for." He also suggested that picture books be created for children.

In the nineteenth century, a few children's titles became famous as classroom reading texts. Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults's 1697 ''Tales of Mother Goose''&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;. The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals. &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on this shift in attitudes came from [[Puritanism]], which stressed the importance of individual salvation. Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children, and there was a large growth in the publication of "good godly books" aimed squarely at children.&lt;ref name=random /&gt; Some of the most popular works were by [[James Janeway]], but the most enduring book from this movement, still read today, especially In modernised versions, is ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678) by [[John Bunyan]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''The New Amplified Pilgrim's Progress'' (both book and dramatized audio) – as retold by James Pappas. Published by Orion's Gate (1999) and ''The Evergreen Wood: An Adaptation of the "Pilgrim's Progress" for Children'' written by Linda Perry, illustrated by Alan Perry. Published by Hunt &amp; Thorpe, 1997. [[The Pilgrim's Progress#Retellings]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chapbook]]s, pocket-sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched,&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|32}} were published in Britain; illustrated by [[Woodcut|woodblock printing]], these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular [[ballads]], historical re-tellings, and folk tales. Though not specifically published for children at this time, young people enjoyed the booklets as well.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|8}} Johanna Bradley says, in ''From Chapbooks to Plum Cake'', that chapbooks kept imaginative stories from being lost to readers under the strict [[Puritan]] influence of the time.&lt;ref name=brad /&gt;{{rp|17}}
[[File:Aforadam.png|thumb|The New England Primer]]
[[Hornbook]]s also appeared in England during this time, teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the [[Lord's Prayer]].&lt;ref name=questia&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia: Children's Literature|year=2009|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422190423/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|archive-date=2012-04-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were brought from England to the [[British America|American colonies]] in the mid-17th century. The first such book was a [[catechism]] for children written in verse by the Puritan [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]]. Known as ''[[Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes]]'', it was published in 1646, appearing both in England and [[Boston]]. Another early book, ''[[The New England Primer]]'', was in print by 1691 and used in schools for 100 years. The [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] begins, "In Adam's fall We sinned all&amp;nbsp;...", and continues through the alphabet. It also contained religious maxims, [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]], spelling help and other educational items, all decorated by [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|35}}

In 1634, the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales. [[Charles Perrault]] began recording [[fairy tale]]s in France, publishing his first collection in 1697. They were not well received among the French literary society, who saw them as only fit for old people and children. In 1658, Jan Ámos [[Comenius]] in [[Bohemia]] published the informative illustrated ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'', for children under six learning to read. It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The first [[Denmark|Danish]] children's book was ''The Child's Mirror'' by [[Niels Bredal]] in 1568, an adaptation of a [[Courtesy book]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] priest [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]. ''A Pretty and Splendid Maiden's Mirror'', an adaptation of a [[Germany|German]] book for young women, became the first [[Sweden|Swedish]] children's book upon its 1591 publication.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|700, 706}} Sweden published fables and a children's magazine by 1766.

In [[Italy]], [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] released ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' in the 1550s. Called the first European storybook to contain fairy-tales, it eventually had 75 separate stories and written for an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Opie |first=Iona |author2=[[Peter Opie]]  |authorlink=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |page=20|location=Oxford and New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1974 |isbn=0-19-211559-6|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Russia]]'s earliest children's books, [[Primer (textbook)|primers]], appeared in the late 16th century. An early example is ''ABC-Book'', an [[alphabet book]] published by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1571.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} The first [[picture book]] published in Russia, [[Karion Istomin]]'s ''The Illustrated Primer'', appeared in 1694.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} [[Peter the Great]]'s interest in [[Modernization|modernizing]] his country through [[Westernization]] helped Western children's literature dominate the field through the 18th century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} [[Catherine the Great]] wrote [[Allegory|allegories]] for children, and during her reign, [[Nikolai Novikov]] started the first juvenile magazine in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}}

=== Origins of the modern genre ===
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|[[Brothers Grimm]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]] (left) and [[Jakob Grimm]] (right) from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]

The modern children's book emerged in mid-18th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-the-newbery-award-got-its-name/|title=How the Newbery Award Got Its Name}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing [[politeness|polite]] middle-class and the influence of [[John Locke|Lockean]] theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept. ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', written and published by [[John Newbery]], is widely considered the first modern children's book, published in 1744. It was a landmark as the first children's publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kodomo.go.jp/ingram/e/section1/index.html|title=Early Children's Literature: From moralistic stories to narratives of everyday life}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a mixture of rhymes, picture stories and games for pleasure.&lt;ref name=marks&gt;{{cite book|last= Marks|first= Diana F.|title=Children's Book Award Handbook|year= 2006|publisher= [[Libraries Unlimited]]|location= Westport, Conn|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children's good behavior than physical discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, John Rowe. ''Written for Children''. (1990). New York: HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06-446125-4}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the child was to record his or her behavior daily.

The book was child–sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursors to the [[toy book]]s popular in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lundin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lundin, Anne H. |year=1994 |title=Victorian Horizons: The Reception of Children's Books in England and America, 1880–1900 |journal=The Library Quarterly |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |volume=64 |issue= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre. According to the journal ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]]'', "Newbery's genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children's books, through his frequent advertisements&amp;nbsp;... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children's books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Susina|first= Jan|title= Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature |journal= The Lion and the Unicorn |date=June 1993|volume= 17|issue= 1|pages= v–vi| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v017/17.1.susina.html| accessdate=30 July 2012 |doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;



The improvement in the quality of books for children, as well as the diversity of topics he published, helped make Newbery the leading producer of children's books in his time. He published his own books as well as those by authors such as [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Oliver Goldsmith]];&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;ref name="Rose, 219"&gt;Rose, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter may have written ''[[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes]]'', Newbery's most popular book.

Another philosopher who influenced the development of children's literature was [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously. His idea of appealing to a children's natural interests took hold among writers for children.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|41}} Popular examples included [[Thomas Day]]'s ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'', four volumes that embody Rousseau's theories. Furthermore, [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria]] and [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]]'s ''[[Practical Education]]: The History of Harry and Lucy'' (1780) urged children to teach themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Leader, Zachary, ''Reading Blake's Songs'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7Q9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau's ideas also had great influence in Germany, especially on [[Philanthropinum|German Philanthropism]], a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children. Its founder, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]], authored ''Elementarwerk'' as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by [[Daniel Chodowiecki]]. Another follower, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], created an adaptation of ''Robinson Crusoe'' that went into over 100 printings. He became Germany's "outstanding and most modern"&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|736}} writer for children. According to Hans-Heino Ewers in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "It can be argued that from this time, the history of European children's literature was largely written in Germany."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|737}}

The [[Brothers Grimm]] preserved and published [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|the traditional tales]] told in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Silvey&gt;{{cite book|last=Silvey|first=Anita (editor)|title=The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators|year= 2002|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]]|location= New York|isbn=0-618-19082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} They were so popular in their home country that modern, realistic children's literature began to be looked down on there. This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|739–740}} The Grimms's contribution to children's literature goes beyond their collection of stories, as great as that is. As professors, they had a scholarly interest in the stories, striving to preserve them and their variations accurately, recording their sources.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|259}} 

A similar project was carried out by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] scholars [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as ''[[Norwegian Folktales]]'', often referred to as ''Asbjørnsen and Moe''. By compiling these stories, they preserved Norway's literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|260}}

Danish author and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]] traveled through Europe and gathered many well-known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Elias Bredsdorff, ''Hans Christian Andersen: the story of his life and work 1805–75'', Phaidon (1975) {{ISBN|0-7148-1636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Switzerland]], [[Johann David Wyss]] published ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1812, with the aim of teaching children about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by [[Isabelle de Montolieu]].

[[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s tale "[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]" was published in 1816 in a German collection of stories for children, ''Kinder-Märchen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nutcracker|last=Hoffmann|first=E.

=== Golden age ===
The shift to a modern genre of children's literature occurred in the mid-19th century; [[didacticism]] of a previous age began to make way for more humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child's imagination. The availability of children's literature greatly increased as well, as paper and [[printing]] became widely available and affordable, the population grew and literacy rates improved.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|654–655}}

''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' by [[Thomas Hughes]] appeared in 1857, and is considered to be the founding book in the [[school story]] tradition.&lt;ref name=knowles&gt;{{cite book|last= Knowles|first= Murray|title= Language and Control in Children's Literature|year= 1996|publisher= [[Psychology Press]]| url=https://books.google.com/?id=2mh6pCDCZ5EC&amp;pg=PP7|isbn= 978-0-203-41975-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}} However, it was [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first "English masterpiece written for children"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|44}} and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the "First Golden Age" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=knowles /&gt;{{rp|18}} Another important book of that decade was ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]'', by Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]] (1862), which became extremely popular in England, and remains a classic of British children's literature.

In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] wrote the first Italian fantasy novel, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', which was translated many times. In that same year, [[Emilio Salgari]], the man who would become "the adventure writer par excellence for the young in Italy"&lt;ref&gt;Lawson Lucas, A. (1995) "The Archetypal Adventures of Emilio Salgari: A Panorama of his Universe and Cultural Connections New Comparison", ''A Journal of Comparative and General Literary Studies'', Number 20 Autumn&lt;/ref&gt; first published his legendary character ''[[Sandokan]]''. In Britain, ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Princess and Curdie]]'', by [[George MacDonald]], appeared in 1872 and 1883, and the adventure stories ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'', both by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], were extremely popular in the 1880s. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' was first published in 1894, and [[J. M. Barrie]] told the story of [[Peter Pan]] in the novel  ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' in 1911. [[Johanna Spyri]]'s two-part novel ''[[Heidi]]'' was published in Switzerland in 1880 and 1881.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|749}} In the US, children's publishing entered a period of growth after the [[American Civil War]] in 1865. Boys' book writer [[William Taylor Adams|Oliver Optic]] published over 100 books. In 1868, the "epoch-making book"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|45}} ''[[Little Women]]'', the fictionalized autobiography of [[Louisa May Alcott]], was published. This "[[coming of age]]" story established the genre of realistic family books in the United States. [[Mark Twain]] released ''[[Tom Sawyer]]'' in 1876, and in 1880 another bestseller, ''[[Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings]]'', a collection of [[African American]] folk tales adapted and compiled by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|478}}

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a plethora of children's novels began featuring realistic, non-magical plotlines. Certain titles received international success such as Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Treasure Island'' (1883), L.M. Montgomery's ''Anne of Green Gables'' (1908), and Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' (1869) &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

== National traditions ==

=== China ===
The Chinese [[Revolution of 1911]] and [[World War II]] brought political and social change that revolutionized children's literature in China. Western science, technology, and literature became fashionable. China's first modern publishing firm, [[Commercial Press]], established several children's magazines, which included ''Youth Magazine'', and ''Educational Pictures for Children''.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|832–833}} The first Chinese children's writer was [[Sun Yuxiu]], an editor of Commercial Press, whose story ''The Kingdom Without a Cat'' was written in the language of the time instead of the classical style used previously. Yuxiu encouraged novelist [[Mao Dun|Shen Dehong]] to write for children as well. Dehong went on to rewrite 28 stories based on classical Chinese literature specifically for children. In 1932, [[Zhang Tianyi]] published ''Big Lin and Little Lin'', the first full-length Chinese novel for children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|833–834}}

The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution of 1949]] changed children's literature again. Many children's writers were denounced, but Tianyi and [[Ye Shengtao]] continued to write for children and created works that aligned with [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideology. The 1976 death of [[Mao Zedong]] provoked more changes that swept China. Many writers from the early part of the century were brought back, and their work became available again. In 1990, ''General Anthology of Modern Children's Literature of China'', a fifteen-volume anthology of children's literature since the 1920s, was released.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|834–835}}

Literature for children developed as a separate category of literature especially in the [[Victorian era]]. Some works became internationally known, such as those of [[Lewis Carroll]], ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, [[Beatrix Potter]] was an author and illustrator, best known for her children's books, which featured animal characters. In her thirties, Potter published ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' in 1902. Potter eventually went on to publish 23 children's books and become a wealthy woman. Michael O. Tunnell and James S. Jacobs, professors of children’s literature at Brigham Young University, write, "Potter was the first to use pictures as well as words to tell the story, incorporating coloured illustration with text, page for page."&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tunnell|first=Michael O.|last2=Jacobs|first2=James S.|date=2013-10-01|title=The Origins and History of American Children's Literature|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/TRTR.1201/abstract|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=80–86|doi=10.1002/TRTR.1201|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another classic of the period is [[Anna Sewell]]'s animal novel ''[[Black Beauty]]'' (1877).

In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], and [[Kate Greenaway]]. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books; among them were [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Cicely Mary Barker]], [[W. Heath Robinson]], [[Henry Justice Ford|Henry J. Ford]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], and [[George Cruikshank]].

The [[Kailyard school]] of Scottish writers, notably [[J. M. Barrie]], creator of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, [[Kenneth Grahame]] wrote the children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' and the [[Scouts]] founder [[Robert Baden-Powell]]'s first book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' was published. Inspiration for [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s novel ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' (1910) was the [[Great Maytham Hall]] Garden in Kent. In 1920 [[Hugh Lofting]] created the character [[Doctor Dolittle]] who appears in a series of [[Doctor Dolittle#The books|twelve books]].

The Golden Age of Children's Literature ended with [[World War I]] in Great Britain and Europe, and the period before [[World War II]] was much slower in children's publishing. The main exceptions in England were the publications of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' by [[A. A. Milne]] in 1926, the first ''[[Mary Poppins]]'' book by [[P. L. Travers]] in 1934, ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in 1937, and the Arthurian novel ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' by [[T. H. White]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|978-0-203-16812-7}}, pp. 682-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's [[paperback]] books were first released in England in 1940 under the [[Puffin Books]] imprint, and their lower prices helped make book buying possible for children during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'', pp. 475-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enid Blyton]]'s books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], [[The Famous Five (novel series)|The Famous Five]], [[The Secret Seven]], and [[The Adventure Series]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Sheila G. (1982), ''The Blyton Phenomenon''. Andre Deutsch, {{ISBN|978-0-233-97441-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these children's stories, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942.

In the 1950s, the book market in Europe began recovering from the effects of two world wars. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "Inklings". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. C. S. Lewis published the first installment of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series in 1950 while Tolkien is best known in addition to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as the author of  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. (1954) Another significant writer of fantasy stories is [[Alan Garner]] author of ''[[Elidor]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Owl Service]]'' (1967). The latter work is an adaptation of the myth of [[Blodeuwedd]] from the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', set in modern [[Wales]], and for it Garner won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a British author.&lt;ref name=medal1967&gt;[http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 (Carnegie Winner 1967)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106194213/http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 |date=2013-01-06 }}.

[[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]] wrote ''[[The Borrowers]]'' (1952), featuring tiny people who borrow from humans. [[Dodie Smith]]'s ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' was published in 1956. [[Philippa Pearce]]'s ''[[Tom's Midnight Garden]]'' (1958) has him opening the garden door at night and entering into a different age. The heroine of ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (novel)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'' by Penelope Farmer (1969) is already shaken by her arrival in a girls' boarding school when she finds herself waking as another girl in the same bed, but decades earlier. Closer to reality, Jenny in ''[[No One Must Know]]'' (1962) by [[Barbara Sleigh]] is a newcomer in the street who faces a landlord's pet ban. She needs urgent help from nearby children to hide her cat and kittens.

[[Roald Dahl]] rose to prominence with his children's [[fantasy novels]], often inspired from experiences from his childhood, with often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-man-who-liked-to-make-up-stories-2158052.html Once upon a time, there was a man who liked to make up stories ...] ''[[The Independent]]'' (Sunday, 12 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl was inspired to write ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), featuring the eccentric candymaker [[Willy Wonka]], having grown up near two chocolate makers in England who often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies into the other's factory. His other works include ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1961), ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (1971), ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'' (1983), and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' (1988).

==== Adventure fiction for children ====
Adventure stories written specifically for children began in the 19th century. Early examples include [[Johann David Wyss]]' ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1812), [[Frederick Marryat]]'s ''[[The Children of the New Forest]]'' (1847) and [[Harriet Martineau]]'s ''The Peasant and the Prince'' (1856).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Hunt, Peter]]. (Editor). ''Children's literature: an illustrated history''. Oxford University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-212320-3}}  (pp.&amp;nbsp;98–100)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victorian era saw the development of the genre, with [[William Henry Giles Kingston|W.H.G. Kingston]], [[Robert Michael Ballantyne|R. M. Ballantyne]] and [[G. A. Henty]] specializing in the production of adventure fiction for boys.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Butts, Dennis,"Adventure Books" in [[Jack Zipes|Zipes, Jack]], ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature''. Volume One. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-514656-1}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–16).&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired writers who normally catered to adult audiences to write for children, and an example is [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s (1850–94) classic [[Piracy|pirate]] story ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883).&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In the years after the First World War, writers such as [[Arthur Ransome]]  (1884–1967) developed the adventure genre by setting the adventure in Britain rather than distant countries. Ransome began publishing in 1930 his [[Swallows and Amazons]] series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the English [[Lake District]] and the [[Norfolk Broads]]. Many of the books involve sailing; fishing and camping are other common subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Brogan, ''The Life of Arthur Ransome''. Jonathan Cape, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biggles]] was a popular series of [[adventure book]]s for young boys, about James Bigglesworth, a fictional pilot and [[adventurer]], by [[W. E. Johns]]. Biggles made his first appearance in the story ''The White Fokker'', published in the first issue of ''[[Light Aircraft Association|Popular Flying]]'' magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, ''The Camels Are Coming'' (both 1932). Johns continued to write Biggles books until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time. These included novels about a woman pilot in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF), Flight Officer Joan Worralson, better known as "[[Worrals]]".

[[Geoffrey Trease]] and [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 1995, (p.&amp;nbsp;208–9)&lt;/ref&gt; brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; [[Philip Pullman]] in the [[Sally Lockhart]] novels and [[Julia Golding]] in the [[Cat Royal]] series have continued the tradition of the historical adventure.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

==== Magazines and comics ====
An important aspect of British children's literature has been [[comic books]] and [[List of early-20th-century British children's magazines and annuals|magazines]]. Amongst the most popular comics have been ''[[The Dandy]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-19284222 BBC News, 16 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Beano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/11766202/Was-Pixars-Inside-Out-inspired-by-The-Beano.html ''The Telegraph'', 27 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Important early magazines or [[story papers]] for older children were the ''[[Boys Own Paper]]'', which was published from 1879 to 1967&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data071.html#BOYSOWNMAGAZINEUK Galatic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Girl's Own Paper]]'' published from 1880 until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data207.html Galatic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; Other story papers for older boys were ''[[The Hotspur]]'' (1933 to 1959) and ''[[The Rover (story paper)|The Rover]]''–which started in 1922 and was absorbed into ''Adventure'' in 1961 and ''[[The Wizard (DC Comics)|The Wizard]]'' in 1963, and eventually folded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcomics.20m.com/home.htm British Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prominent authors contributed to the ''Boys Own Paper'': [[cricket]]er [[W.G. Grace]] wrote for several issues, along with authors [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Jules Verne]] and [[R.M. Ballantyne]], as well as [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the inspiration for the [[Scout Movement]], Between 1941–61 there was 60 issues with stories about [[Biggles]] by [[W. E. Johns]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boysown.info/|title=Boys Own Paper featuring the work of Captain W E Johns|last=rogerharris@biggles.info|website=www.boysown.info|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1960s occasional contributors included [[Isaac Asimov]] and the respected astronomer [[Patrick Moore]].

Many contributors to ''The Girls Own Paper'' were not known outside the paper's pages but they also included [[Noel Streatfeild]], [[Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd]], [[Rosa Nouchette Carey]], [[Sarah Doudney]] (1841–1926), [[Angela Brazil]], [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]], [[Richmal Crompton]], [[Fanny Fern]], and [[Baroness Orczy]]. Between 1940–47 [[Captain W. E.

Children's literature has been a part of American culture since Europeans first settled in America. The earliest books were used as tools to instill self-control in children and preach a life of morality in Puritan society. 18th-century American youth began to shift away from the social upbringing of its European counterpart, bringing about a change in children's literature. It was in this time that ''A Little Book for Little Children'' was written by T.W. in 1712. It includes what is thought to be the earliest nursery rhyme and one of the earliest examples of a text book approaching education from the child's point of view, rather than the adult's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bingham|author2=Scholt|title=Fifteen Centuries of Children's Literature|date=1980|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-22164-2|pages=99,107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous books of American children's literature is [[L. Frank Baum]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', published in 1900. "By combining the English fondness for word play with the American appetite for outdoor adventure", Connie Epstein in ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'' says Baum "developed an original style and form that stands alone".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479}} Baum wrote fourteen more Oz novels, and other writers continued the [[List of Oz books|Oz series]] into the twenty-first century.

Demand continued to grow in [[North America]] between World War I and World War II, helped by the growth of libraries in both Canada and the United States. Children's reading rooms in libraries, staffed by specially trained librarians, helped create demand for classic juvenile books. Reviews of children's releases began appearing regularly in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and in ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' magazine began to regularly publish reviews of children's releases, and the first Children's Book Week was launched in 1919. In that same year, [[Louise Seaman Bechtel]] became the first person to head a juvenile book publishing department in the country. She was followed by [[May Massee]] in 1922, and [[Alice Dalgliesh]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479–480}}

The [[American Library Association]] began awarding the [[Newbery Medal]], the first children's book award, in 1922.&lt;ref name=newbery&gt;{{cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caldecott Medal]] for illustration followed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caldecott Medal Awards |url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/caldecottmedal#30s |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] about her life on the [[American frontier]], ''[[Little House in the Big Woods]]'' appeared in 1932.&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|471}} In 1937 [[Theodor Seuss Geisel|Dr. Seuss]] published his first book, entitled, ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]''. The [[young adult book]] market developed during this period, thanks to sports books by popular writer [[John R. Tunis]]', the novel ''[[Seventeenth Summer]]'' by [[Maureen Daly]], and the ''[[Sue Barton (juvenile series)|Sue Barton]]'' nurse book series by [[Helen Dore Boylston]].&lt;ref name=cart&gt;{{cite book|last=Cart|first=Michael|title=Young Adult Literature: From Romance to Realism|year=2010|publisher=[[ALA Editions]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4RJ8rOTTgC|isbn=978-0-8389-1045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

The already vigorous growth in children's books became a boom in the 1950s, and children's publishing became big business.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} In 1952, American journalist [[E. B. White]] published ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', which was described as "one of the very few books for young children that face, squarely, the subject of death".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|467}} [[Maurice Sendak]] illustrated more than two dozen books during the decade, which established him as an innovator in book illustration.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] that began in 1957, provided increased interest and government money for schools and libraries to buy science and math books and the non-fiction book market "seemed to materialize overnight".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|482}}

The 1960s saw an age of new realism in children's books emerge. Given the atmosphere of social revolution in 1960s America, authors and illustrators began to break previously established taboos in children's literature. Controversial subjects dealing with alcoholism, death, divorce, and child abuse were now being published in stories for children. Maurice Sendak's ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' in 1963 and [[Louise Fitzhugh]]'s ''[[Harriet the Spy]]'' in 1964 are often considered the first stories published in this new age of realism.&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86" /&gt;

[[Esther Forbes]] in ''[[Johnny Tremain]]'' (1943) and [[Mildred D. Taylor]] in ''[[Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry]]'' (1976) continued the tradition of the historical adventure in an American setting.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; The modern children's adventure novel sometimes deals with controversial issues like terrorism, as in [[Robert Cormier]]'s ''[[After the First Death]]'' in 1979, and warfare in the [[Third World]], as in [[Peter Dickinson]]'s ''AK'' in 1990.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In books for a younger age group, Bill Martin and John Archambault's ''[[Chicka Chicka Boom Boom]]'' (1979) presented a new spin on the [[alphabet book]]. [[Laura Numeroff]] published ''[[If You Give a Mouse a Cookie]]'' in 1985 and went on to create a series of similarly named books that is still popular for children and adults to read together.

[[Lloyd Alexander]]'s [[The Chronicles of Prydain]] (1964-1968) was set in a fictionalized version of medieval Britain.

=== Continental Europe ===
The period from 1890 until [[World War I]] is considered the Golden Age of Children's Literature in [[Scandinavia]]. [[Erik Werenskiold]], [[Theodor Kittelsen]], and [[Dikken Zwilgmeyer]] were especially popular, writing folk and fairy tales as well as realistic fiction. The 1859 translation into English by [[George Webbe Dasent]] helped increase the stories' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 705,&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential and internationally most successful Scandinavian children's books from this period is [[Selma Lagerlöf]]s ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''. [[Astrid Lindgren]] (''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'') and [[Jostein Gaarder]] (''[[Sophie's World]]'') are two of the best-known Scandinavian writers internationally.

The interwar period saw a slow-down in output similar to Britain, although "one of the first mysteries written specifically for children," ''[[Emil and the Detectives]]'' by [[Erich Kästner]], was published in Germany in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Silvey, (editor) (2002). ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators''. New York: Houghton Mifflin, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;  German writers [[Michael Ende]] (''[[The Neverending Story]]'') and [[Cornelia Funke]] (''[[Inkheart]]'') achieved international success with their fantasy books.

The period during and following World War II became the Classical Age of the picture book in Switzerland, with works by [[Alois Carigiet]], [[Felix Hoffmann (illustrator)|Felix Hoffmann]], and [[Hans Fischer (painter)|Hans Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. pp. 683–685, 399, 692, 697, 750.&lt;/ref&gt; 1963 was the first year of the [[Bologna Children's Book Fair]] in Italy, which was described as "the most important international event dedicated to the children's publishing".&lt;ref name=bologna&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy {{!}} Bologna Children's Book Fair|url=http://culture360.org/event/italy-bologna-childrens-book-fair/|publisher=Culture360|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For four days it brings together writers, illustrators, publishers, and book buyers from around the world.&lt;ref name=bologna /&gt;

Swiss author Marcus Pfister's ''[[Rainbow Fish]]'' series has received international acclaim since 1992.

=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===
[[File:Stamp-russia2010-children-books-block.png|thumb|Postal stamp of Russia celebrating children's books.]]

[[Russian folktale]]s were collected by [[Aleksandr Afanasyev]] in his three volume ''Narodnye russkie skazki'', and a selection of these were published in ''Русские детские сказки'' (Russian Children's Fairy Tales) in 1871. By the 1860s, [[literary realism]] and non-fiction dominated children's literature. More schools were started, using books by writers like [[Konstantin Ushinsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose ''Russian Reader'' included an assortment of stories, fairy tales, and fables. Books written specifically for girls developed in the 1870s and 1880s. Publisher and journalist [[Evgenia Tur]] wrote about the daughters of well-to-do landowners, while [[Alexandra Nikitichna Annenskaya]]'s stories told of middle-class girls working to support themselves. [[Vera Zhelikhovsky]], [[Elizaveta Kondrashova]], and [[Nadezhda Lukhmanova]] also wrote for girls during this period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|767}}

Children's non-fiction gained great importance in Russia at the beginning of the century. A ten-volume children's encyclopedia was published between 1913 and 1914. [[Vasily Avenarius]] wrote fictionalized biographies of important people like [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Alexander Pushkin]] around the same time, and scientists wrote for books and magazines for children. Children's magazines flourished, and by the end of the century there were 61. [[Lidia Charskaya]] and {{ill|Klavdiya Lukashevich|ru|Лукашевич, Клавдия Владимировна}} continued the popularity of girls' fiction. [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] took a gloomy turn by frequently showing the maltreatment of children from lower classes. The most popular boys' material was [[Sherlock Holmes]], and similar stories from detective magazines.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|768}}

The state took control of children's literature during the [[October Revolution]]. [[Maksim Gorky]] edited the first children's, ''Northern Lights'', under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. People often label the 1920s as the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|769}} [[Samuil Marshak]] led that literary decade as the "founder of (Soviet) children's literature".&lt;ref name=shray&gt;{{cite book|last=Shrayer|first=Maxim (editor)|title=An Anthology of Jewish-Russian Literature: 1801–1953|year=2007|publisher=[[M.

In 1932, professional writers in the Soviet Union formed the [[USSR Union of Writers]], which served as the writer's organization of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. With a children's branch, the official oversight of the professional organization brought children's writers under the control of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state]] and the police. [[Communism|Communist principles]] like [[Common ownership|collectivism]] and [[solidarity]] became important themes in children's literature. Authors wrote biographies about revolutionaries like [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Pavlik Morozov]]. [[Alexander Belyayev]], who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, became Russia's first [[science fiction]] writer.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|770}} According to Ben Hellman in the ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "war was to occupy a prominent place in juvenile reading, partly compensating for the lack of adventure stories", during the Soviet Period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|771}} More political changes in Russia after [[World War II]] brought further change in children's literature. Today, the field is in a state of flux because some older authors are being rediscovered and others are being abandoned.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|772}}

The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as [[C. S. Lewis]], [[The Chronicles of Narnia]] and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]] series.{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 short story "A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado", and was later republished as the first chapter of "Reinações de Narizinho", which is the first novel of the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The main setting is the "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo", where a boy (Pedrinho), a girl (Narizinho) and their living and thinking anthropomorphic toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as [[Neverland]], the mythological [[Ancient Greece]], an underwater world known as "Reino das Águas Claras" (Clear Waters Kingdom), and even the outer space. The "Sítio" is often symbolized by the character of [[Emilia (Sítio do Picapau Amarelo)|Emília]], Lobato's most famous creation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Christian missionaries]] first established the [[Calcutta School-Book Society]] in the 19th century, creating a separate genre for children's literature in that country. Magazines and books for children in native languages soon appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|808}} In the latter half of the century, [[Raja Shivprasad]] wrote several well-known books in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|810}} A number of respected [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writers began producing [[Bengali literature]] for children including [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], who translated some stories and wrote others himself. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote plays, stories, and poems for children, including one work illustrated by painter [[Nandalal Bose]]. They worked from the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th century. Tagore's work was later translated into English, with Bose's pictures.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811}} [[Behari Lal Puri]] was the earliest writer for children in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].

Bengali children's literature flourished in the later part of the twentieth century. Educator [[Gijubhai Badheka]] published over 200 books in the [[Children's literature in Gujarati language]], and many of them are still popular.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|812}} Other popular Gujarati children's authors were [[Ramanlal Soni]] and [[Jivram Joshi]]. In 1957, political cartoonist [[K. Shankar Pillai]] founded the [[Children's Book Trust]] publishing company. The firm became known for high quality children's books, and many of them were released in several languages. One of the most distinguished writers is Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] in [[Oriya literature]], who wrote many good books for children, including ''Pari Raija'', ''Kuhuka Raija'', ''Panchatantra'', and ''Adi Jugara Galpa Mala''. He wrote biographies of many historical personalities, such as ''Kapila Deva''. In 1978, the firm organized a writers' competition to encourage quality children's writing. The following year, the Children's Book Trust began a writing workshop and organized the First International Children's Book Fair in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|809}} Children's magazines, available in many languages, were widespread throughout India during this century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811–820}}

Originally, for centuries, stories were told by Africans in their native languages, many being told during social gatherings. Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom.

Most children's books depict the African culture and lifestyle, and trace their roots to traditional folktales, riddles, and proverbs. Authors who have produced such works include [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Cyprian Ekwensi]], [[Amos Tutuola]], [[Flora Nwapa]], and [[Buchi Emecheta]]. Publishing companies also aided in the development of children's literature.

== Classification ==
Children's literature can be divided into categories, either according to [[Literary genre|genre]] or the intended age of the reader.
[[File:The return of Rama.jpg|thumb|A [[Abanindranath Tagore|Tagore]] illustration of a Hindu myth]]

=== By genre ===
A literary genre is a category of literary compositions. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length.  According to Anderson,&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson 2006&lt;/ref&gt; there are six categories of children's literature (with some significant subgenres):
* [[Picture books]], including concept books that teach the [[alphabet]] or [[counting]] for example, pattern books, and wordless books.
* [[Literature|Traditional literature]], including folktales, which convey the legends, customs, superstitions, and beliefs of people in previous civilizations. This genre can be further broken into subgenres: [[myth]]s, [[fable]]s, [[legend]]s, and [[fairy tale]]s
* [[Fiction]], including [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]], [[Literary realism|realistic fiction]], and [[historical fiction]]
* [[Non-fiction]]
* [[Biography]] and [[autobiography]]
* [[Poetry]] and verse.

=== By age category ===
The criteria for these divisions are vague, and books near a borderline may be classified either way. Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language, use large print, and have many illustrations. Books for older children use increasingly complex language, normal print, and fewer (if any) illustrations. The categories with an age range are listed below:
* [[Picture book]]s, appropriate for pre-readers or children ages 0–5.
* [[Early reader]] books, [[appropriate for children]] ages 5–7.  These books are often designed to help a child build his or her reading skills.
* [[Chapter book]]s, appropriate for children ages 7–12.
** Short chapter books, appropriate for children ages 7–9.
** Longer chapter books, appropriate for children ages 9–12.
* [[Young adult fiction]], appropriate for children ages 12–18.

Pictures have always accompanied children's stories.&lt;ref name=lerer&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerer|first=Seth|title=Children's Literature: A Reader's History, from Aesop to Harry Potter|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320}} A [[papyrus]] from [[Diocese of Egypt (Late Antiquity)|Byzantine Egypt]], shows illustrations accompanied by the story of [[Hercules]]' labors.&lt;ref&gt;Cribiore, Raffaella, ''Gymnastics of the Mind'', pg. 139 [[Princeton University]], 2001, cited in Lerer, Seth, ''Children's Literature'', pg. 22, [[University of Chicago]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern children's books are [[illustration|illustrated]] in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature, except in [[graphic novel]]s. Generally, artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers (especially pre-literate children). Children's picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children. Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations, they continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books.

According to Joyce Whalley in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "an illustrated book differs from a book with [[illustration]]s in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|221}} Using this definition, the first illustrated children's book is considered to be ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' which was published in 1658 by the [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravian]] author [[Comenius]]. Acting as a kind of encyclopedia,''Orbis Pictus'' had a picture on every page, followed by the name of the object in [[Latin]] and German. It was translated into English in 1659 and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for years.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|220}}

Early children's books, such as ''Orbis Pictus'', were illustrated by [[woodcut]], and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|322}} Newer processes, including copper and steel [[engraving]] were first used in the 1830s. One of the first uses of [[Chromolithography]] (a way of making multi-colored prints) in a children's book was demonstrated in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', published in Germany in 1845. English illustrator [[Walter Crane]] refined its use in children's books in the late 19th century. [[File:Crane frog4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Crane]]'s [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]] illustration for ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]'', 1874.]]

Another method of creating illustrations for children's books was [[etching]], used by [[George Cruikshank]] in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Kate Greenaway]], and [[John Tenniel]]. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–226}} ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators'' credits Caldecott with "The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|350}}

Twentieth-century artists such as [[Kay Nielson]], [[Edmund Dulac]], and [[Arthur Rackham]] produced illustrations that are still reprinted today.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–227}} Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children's books. After World War II, [[Offset printing|offset lithography]] became more refined, and painter-style illustrations, such as [[Brian Wildsmith]]'s were common by the 1950s.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|233}}

== Scholarship ==
Professional organizations, dedicated publications, individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children's literature. Scholarship in children's literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields: literary studies/cultural studies (literature and language departments and humanities), library and information science, and education. (Wolf, et al., 2011).

Typically, children's literature scholars from literature departments in universities (English, German, Spanish, etc. departments), cultural studies, or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books. This [[literary criticism]] may focus on an author, a thematic or topical concern, genre, period, or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances (poststructural, postcolonial, New Criticism, psychoanalytic, new historicism, etc.). Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals.

The field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children's literature.

Most educational researchers studying children's literature explore issues related to the use of children's literature in classroom settings.  They may also study topics such as home use, children's out-of-school reading, or parents' use of children's books. Teachers typically use children's literature to augment classroom instruction.

Popular classics such as ''[[The Secret Garden]]'', ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'', ''[[Peter Pan]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' have been criticized for their [[racial stereotyping]].&lt;ref name="cracked.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flood|first1=Alison|title=Pippi Longstocking books charged with racism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/09/pippi-longstocking-books-racism|website=the guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byrd|first1=M.

The academic journal ''Children’s Literature Review'' provides critical analysis of many well known children’s books. In its 114th volume, the journal discuses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist [[Herge]]’s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Tintin|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=114|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of 1881 and 1914 there was a large production of children's literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent. This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources. Resulting in a new age of books which put a “gloss” on imperialism and its teachings at the time. Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals, savages and un human like. Therefor needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals. Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Examples of these books include:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Lou lou chez les negres (1929) - lou lou among the blacks
* Baba Diène et Morceau de sucre (1939)
* Original Barbar series promoting the french civilizing mission
* TINTIN au Congo (1931) - Where Tintin goes to teach lessons in Congo about their country, Belgium

The picture book ''[[The Snowy Day]]'', written and illustrated by [[Ezra Jack Keats]] was published in 1962 and is known as the first picture book to portray an African-American child as a protagonist.

Writer Mary Renck Jalongo In ''Young Children and Picture Books'' discusses damaging stereotypes of [[Native Americans in children's literature]], stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the 1800s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=39|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depictions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people in [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]’s ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'' and [[J.M. Barrie]]’s ''[[Peter Pan]]'' are widely discussed among critics.

=== The Empire, imperialism and colonialism ===

The presence of [[empire]] as well as pro-colonialist and [[imperialist]] themes in children’s literature have been identified in some of the most well known children’s classics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siecle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism.

In the French illustrator [[Jean de Brunhoff]]’s 1931 picture book ''Histoire de Babar, le petit elephant (The Story of [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], The Little Elephant)'', prominent themes of [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] have been noted and identified as propaganda. An allegory for French colonialism, Babar easily assimilates himself into the bourgeois lifestyle. It is a world where the elephants who have adapted themselves dominate the animals who have not yet been assimilated into the new and powerful civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Babar|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=116|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WIELAND|first1=RAOUL|title=Babar The Elephant – Racism, Sexism, and Privilege in Children’s Storie|url=http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/babar-the-elephant-racism-sexism-and-privilege-hesaid/|website=The Good Men Project|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title=Freeing the Elephants: What Babar brought.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/09/22/freeing-the-elephants|website=The New Yorker|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.

Details such as the man in colonialist uniform and Curious George's lack of tail are points in this argument.

=== Gender roles and representation of women ===
Some of the earliest children’s stories that contain feminist themes are [[Louisa May Alcott]]’s ''[[Little Women]]'' and [[Frank L. Baum]]’s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. With many women of this period being represented in children’s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this pattern. Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement. ''Little Women'', a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' result from influence of Baum's mother-in law, [[Matilda Gage]], an important figure in the [[suffragist]] movement. Baum's significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage's influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author [[Tove Jansson]]'s [[Moomin]] series which features strong and individualized female characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=18–20, 25–45 &amp; 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of [[feminist children's literature]] as well as a rise in [[gender neutrality]] in children's literature.

In addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls, children's books frequently lack female characters entirely, or include them only as minor or unimportant characters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the book ''Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics'', scholar [[Alison Lurie]] says most adventure novels of the 20th century, with few exceptions, contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by [[Dr. Seuss]], would typically be assigned the gender-specific roles of receptionists and nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=43 &amp; 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' characters written by [[A. A. Milne]], are primarily male, with the exception of the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]], who is a mother to [[Roo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children's books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The near-absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children's literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the one hand ''Growing up with Dick and Jane'' highlights the heterosexual, [[nuclear family]] and also points out the gender-specific duties of the mother, father, brother and sister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kismaric|first1=Carole|last2=Heiferman|first2=Marvin|title=Growing up with Dick and Jane: Learning and Living the American Dream|date=1996|publisher=Collins San Francisco,|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Young Children and Picture Books'', on the other hand, encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children’s books that have repressive and [[sexist]] stereotypes for women.&lt;ref name="Young Children and Picture Books" /&gt;

In her book ''Children’s Literature: From the fin de siècle to the new millennium'', professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children's books prominently until the 1990s. She also says that [[capitalism]] encourages gender-specific marketing of books and toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism. London: Routledge|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls, but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls; therefore, a story that features male characters is expected to sell better.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Why are there so few girls in children’s books?|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2016-01-08|access-date = 2016-01-09|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Jennie|last = Yabroff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards, which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour, identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children’s literature. She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood. Conversely, boys are prepared for leadership roles and war.&lt;ref name="Northcote House"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 20th century, more than 5,000 children's picture books were published in the U.S; during that time, male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 2, and male animals outnumbered female animals by 3 to 1.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|last2=Fairchild|first2=Emily|last3=Grauerholz|first3=Liz|last4=Pescosolido|first4=Bernice A.|last5=Tope|first5=Daniel|date=31 March 2011|title=Gender in Twentieth-Century Children’s Books:  Patterns of Disparity in Titles and Central Characters|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243211398358|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|issn=0891-2432|lay-url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books|lay-source=Why are there so few girls in children's books?|lay-date=8 January 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No children's picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''I’m Glad I’m a Boy! I’m Glad I’m a Girl!'' (1970) by [[Whitney Darrow Jr.]] was criticized for its narrow depictions of careers for both boys and girls. The book informs the reader that boys are doctors, policemen, pilots, and Presidents while girls are nurses, meter maids, stewardesses and First Ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Popova|first1=Maria|title=I’m Glad I’m a Boy!

In his article, entitled “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book ''The Flying Train'',” Dr. Mehdi Ghasemi draws attention to the ways Janaki Sooriyarachchi – the writer and illustrator of ''The Flying Train'' – validates feminine and masculine voices and visions and balances gender issues both in the story book's narratives and illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Ghasemi, Mehdi. “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book The Flying Train.” Libri &amp; Liberi, vol. 3 (1), 2014: 43-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate over controversial content ===

A widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children’s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content, specifically racial stereotypes, should be changed upon the printing of new editions. Some question if certain books should be banned&lt;ref name="Adios Barbie" /&gt; while others believe original content should remain but publishers should make additions that guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Kavitha|title=Are some children's classics unsuitable for kids?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/22/childrens-classics-unsuitable-kids|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marche|first1=Stephen|title=How to Read a Racist Book to Your Kids|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/magazine/how-to-read-a-racist-book-to-your-kids.html?_r=3|website=The New York Times Magazine|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Children’s Culture Reader'', scholar [[Henry Jenkins]] references [[Herbert Kohl]]’s essay ''Should We Burn Babar?'' which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes. Jenkins suggests that parents and educators should trust children to make responsible judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Henry|title=The Children's Cultural Reader|date=1998|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York and London|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some books have been altered in newer editions and significant changes can be seen, such as illustrator [[Richard Scarry]]’s book ''[[Best Word Book Ever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-Huong|title=Spot the difference: This update to a classic children’s book reimagines gender roles|url=http://qz.com/545860/richard-scarrys-update-to-a-classic-childrens-book-reimagines-gender-roles-for-boys-and-girls/|website=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roald Dahl]]’s book ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine" /&gt; In other cases classics have been rewritten into updated versions by new authors and illustrators. Several versions of ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'' have been remade as more appropriate and without prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on early childhood development ===

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'', uses [[psychoanalysis]] to examine the impact that [[fairy tales]] have on the developing child. Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story, which shape their perception and guides their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bettelheim|first1=Bruno|title=The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=United States|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, author and illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]] contends the early viewing of an image in a [[picture book]] leaves an important and lasting impression on a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, a child’s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years. Their environment and interaction with images in picture books have a profound impact on this development and are intended to inform a child about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacCann|first1=Donnarae|last2=Richard|first2=Olga|title=The child's first books; a critical study of pictures and texts|date=1973|publisher=Wilson|location=New York|page=1 &amp; 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children’s literature critic [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]] argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an [[ideology]] of the culture it comes from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Peter|title=Literature for Children Contemporary Criticism|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics discuss how an author’s ethnicity, gender and social class inform their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|date=2008|publisher=Johns Hopkins United Press|location=Baltimore|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language, children are imbedded with the values of that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds states that it is through children’s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should, according to the expectations of their culture. She also attributes [[capitalism]], in certain societies, as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave.&lt;ref name="Northcote House" /&gt; The "image of childhood"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children "at their most susceptible age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egoff|first1=Sheila A.|title=Thursday's Child: Trends and Patterns in Contemporary Children's Literature|date=1981|publisher=American Library Association|location=Chicago, Ill|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kate Greenaway]]’s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In [[Roberta Seelinger Trites]]'s book ''Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature'', she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trites|first1=Roberta Seelinger|title=Disturbing the Universe Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature|date=2000|publisher=U of Iowa|location=Iowa City|page=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study ''The First R: How Children Learn About Race and Racism'', researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi-ethnic daycare centres. Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world. She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ausdale|first1=Debra|last2=Feagin|first2=Joe R.|title=The First R: How Children Learn Race and Racism|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md}}&lt;/ref&gt; using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ausdale|first1=Debra|last2=Feagin|first2=Joe R.|title=The First R: How Children Learn Race and Racism|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Many noted awards for children's literature exist in various countries:
* In [[Africa]], [[The Golden Baobab Prize]] runs an annual competition for African writers of children's stories.  It is one of the few African literary awards that recognizes writing for children and young adults. The competition is the only pan-African writing competition that recognizes promising African writers of children's literature. Every year, the competition invites entries of unpublished African-inspired stories written for an audience of 8- to 11-year-olds (Category A) or 12- to 15-year-olds (Category B). The writers who are aged 18 or below, are eligible for the Rising Writer Prize.

[[File:Color opponent process theory contrast of complementary colors.svg|thumb|Complementary colors in the [[opponent process]] theory]]
'''Complementary colors''' are pairs of [[color]]s which, when combined or [[color mixing|mixed]], cancel each other out (lose [[hue]]) by producing a [[grayscale]] color like [[white]] or [[black]].&lt;ref&gt;''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', 5th Edition, Oxford University Press (2002) "A colour that combined with a given colour makes white or black."&lt;/ref&gt; When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those particular two colors. Due to this striking color clash, the term '''opposite colors''' is often considered more appropriate than "complementary colors".

Which pairs of colors are considered complementary depends on the color theory one uses:
*Modern color theory uses either the [[RGB color model|RGB]] [[additive color]] model or the [[CMYK color model|CMY]] [[subtractive color]] model, and in these, the complementary pairs are '''[[red]]–[[cyan]]''', '''[[green]]–[[magenta]]''', and '''[[blue]]–[[yellow]]'''.
*In the traditional [[RYB color model]], the complementary color pairs are red–green, yellow–purple, and blue–orange.
*[[Opponent process]] theory suggests that the most contrasting color pairs are red–green, and blue–yellow.

==In different color models==
===Traditional color model===
On the traditional [[color wheel]] developed in the 18th century, used by Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh and other painters, and still used by many [[artist]]s today, the primary colors were considered to be red, yellow, and blue, and the primary–secondary complementary pairs are red–green, blue-orange, and yellow–purple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maloney|first=Tim|title=Get Animated!: Creating Professional Cartoon Animation On Your Home Computer|year=2009|publisher=Random House Digital|isbn=9780823099214|page=PT32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fthWZUOAOVEC&amp;pg=PT32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional representation, a complementary color pair is made up of a primary color (yellow, blue or red) and a secondary color (green, purple or orange). For example, yellow is a [[primary color]], and painters can make purple by mixing of red and blue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Lee|title=Acrylic Painting With Lee Hammond|year=2006|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=9781600615801|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQuM4LYlB_IC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=paint+violet+mix+red+blue&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Dwi0UaDqIIHoiwLE64DQCA&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=paint%20violet%20mix%20red%20blue&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; so when yellow and purple paint are mixed, all three primary colors are present. Since paints work by absorbing light, having all three primaries together results in a black or gray color (see [[subtractive color]]). In more recent painting manuals, the more precise subtractive primary colors are magenta, cyan and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;for example, see Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, La Couleur expliquée aux artistes, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementary colors can create some striking optical effects. The shadow of an object appears to contain some of the complementary color of the object. For example, the shadow of a red apple will appear to contain a little blue-green. This effect is often copied by painters who want to create more luminous and realistic shadows. Also, if you stare at a square of color for a long period of time (thirty seconds to a minute), and then look at a white paper or wall, you will briefly see an [[afterimage]] of the square in its complementary color.

Placed side-by-side as tiny dots, in partitive color mixing, complementary colors appear gray.&lt;ref name="briggs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/044.php|title=The Dimensions of Color|author=David Briggs|year=2007|accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colors produced by light===
The [[RGB color model]], invented in the 19th century and fully developed in the 20th century, uses combinations of red, green, and blue light against a black background to make the colors seen on a [[computer monitor]] or television screen. In the RGB model, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. The complementary primary–secondary combinations are [[red]]–[[cyan]], [[green]]–[[magenta]], and [[blue]]–[[yellow]]. In the RGB color model, the light of two complementary colors, such as red and cyan, combined at full intensity, will make white light, since two complementary colors contain light with the full range of the spectrum. If the light is not fully intense, the resulting light will be gray.

In some other color models, such as the [[HSL and HSV|HSV color space]], the neutral colors (white, greys, and black) lie along a central axis. Complementary colors (as defined in HSV) lie opposite each other on any horizontal cross-section. For example, in the [[CIE 1931 color space]] a color of a "[[dominant wavelength|dominant]]" wavelength can be mixed with an amount of the [[complementary wavelength]] to produce a neutral color (gray or white).

===Color printing===
[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|In the CMYK color model, the primary colors magenta, cyan, and yellow together make black, and the complementary pairs are magenta–green, yellow–blue, and cyan–red.|thumb|200px]]

Color printing, like painting, also uses subtractive colors, but the complementary colors are different from those used in painting. As a result, the same logic applies as to colors produced by light. Color printing uses the [[CMYK color model]], making colors by overprinting cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. In printing the most common complementary colors are magenta–green, yellow–blue, and cyan–red. In terms of complementary/opposite colors, this model gives exactly the same result as using the RGB model. Black is added when needed to make the colors darker.

==In theory and art==
===In color theory===
The effect that colors have upon each other had been noted since antiquity. In his essay ''[[On Colors]]'', [[Aristotle]] observed that "when light falls upon another color, then, as a result of this new combination, it takes on another nuance of color."&lt;ref&gt;[[On Colors]] or ''De Coloribus'' (793b) cited in John Gage, ''Couleur et Culture'', pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] had written that purple looked different next to white than it did next to black, and that gold looked more striking against blue than it did against white; the Italian Renaissance architect and writer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] observed that there was harmony (''coniugatio'' in Latin, and ''amicizia'' in Italian) between certain colors, such as red–green and red–blue; and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] observed that the finest harmonies were those between colors exactly opposed (''retto contrario''), but no one had a convincing scientific explanation why that was so until the 18th century.

In 1704, in his treatise on optics, [[Isaac Newton]] devised a circle showing a [[spectrum]] of seven colors. In this work and in an earlier work in 1672, he observed that certain colors around the circle were opposed to each other and provided the greatest contrast; he named red and blue, yellow and violet, and green and "a purple close to scarlet."&lt;ref&gt;John Gage, ''Couleur et culture'', pg. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following decades, scientists refined Newton's color circle, eventually giving it twelve colors: the three primary colors (yellow, blue, and red); three secondary colors (green, purple and orange), made by combining primary colors; and six additional tertiary colors, made by combining the primary and secondary colors.

In 1793, the American-born British scientist [[Benjamin Thompson]], Count Rumford (1753–1814), coined the term complementary colors. While staying at an inn in Florence, he made an experiment with candles and shadows, and discovered that colored light and the shadow cast by the light had perfectly contrasting colors. He wrote, "To every color, without exception, whatever may be its hue or shade, or however it may be compounded, there is another in perfect harmony to it, which is its complement, and may be said to be its companion." He also noted some of the practical benefits of this discovery. "By experiments of this kind, which might easily be made, ladies may choose ribbons for their gowns, or those who furnish rooms may arrange their colors upon principles of the most perfect harmony and of the purest taste. The advantages that painters might derive from a knowledge of these principles of the harmony of colors are too obvious to require illustration."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=udu4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22count+rumford%22+experiments+coloured+shadows&amp;q=&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22count%20rumford%22%20experiments%20coloured%20shadows&amp;f=false Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, ''Conjectures respecting the Principle of the Harmony of Colors'', ''The Complete Works of Count Rumford''], Volume 5, pp. 67–68. (Google Books).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, scientists and philosophers across Europe began studying the nature and interaction of colors. The German poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] presented his own theory in 1810, stating that the two primary colors were those in the greatest opposition to each other, yellow and blue, representing light and darkness. He wrote that "Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; blue is a darkness weakened by light."&lt;ref&gt;Goethe (1810), ''Theory of Colors'', paragraph 502.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the opposition of blue and yellow, through a process called "steigerung, or "augementation" a third color, red, was born.{{page needed|date=June 2013}} Goethe also proposed several sets of complementary colors which "demanded" each other. According to Goethe, "yellow 'demands' violet; orange [demands] blue; [[Theory of colours#Colour terminology|purple]] [demands] green; and vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;Goethe, ''Theory of Colours'', trans. Charles Lock Eastlake, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-262-57021-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe's ideas were highly personal and often disagreed with other scientific research, but they were highly popular and influenced some important artists, including [[J.M.W. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;John Gage, ''Couleur et Culture'', pp. 201–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time that Goethe was publishing his theory, a British physicist, doctor and Egyptologist, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] (1773–1829), showed by experiments that it was not necessary to use all the colors of spectrum to create white light; it could be done by combining the light of just three colors; red, green, and blue. This discovery was the foundation of [[additive color]]s, and of the [[RGB color model]].&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, La couleur expliqée aux artistes, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that it was possible to create magenta by combining red and blue light; to create yellow by mixing red and green light; and to create cyan, or blue-green, by mixing green and blue. He also found that it was possible to create virtually any other color by modifying the intensity of these colors. This discovery led to the system used today to create colors on a computer or television display. Young was also the first to propose that the [[retina]] of the eye contained nerve fibers which were sensitive to three different colors. This foreshadowed the modern understanding of [[color vision]], in particular the finding that the eye does indeed have three color receptors which are sensitive to different wavelength ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Young, T.|year= 1802|title= Bakerian Lecture: On the Theory of Light and Colours|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.|volume= 92|pages=12–48| doi= 10.1098/rstl.1802.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time as Young discovered additive colors, another British scientist, [[David Brewster]] (1781–1868), the inventor of the [[kaleidoscope]], proposed a competing theory that the true primary colors were red, yellow, and blue, and that the true complementary pairs were red–green, blue–orange, and yellow–purple. Then a German scientist, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], (1821–1894), resolved the debate by showing that colors formed by light, additive colors, and those formed by pigments, subtractive colors, did in fact operate by different rules, and had different primary and complementary colors.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, ''La couleur expliquée aux artistes'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists looked more closely at the use of complementary colors. In 1828, the French chemist [[Eugene Chevreul]], making a study of the manufacture of [[Gobelin]] tapestries to make the colors brighter, demonstrated scientifically that "the arrangement of complementary colors is superior to any other harmony of contrasts." His 1839 book on the subject, ''De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs et de l'assortiment des objets colorés'', showing how complementary colors can be used in everything from textiles to gardens, was widely read in Germany, France and England, and made complementary colors a popular concept. The use of complementary colors was further publicized by the French art critic [[Charles Blanc]] in his book ''Grammaire des arts et du dessin'' (1867) and later by the American color theorist [[Ogden Rood]] in his book ''Modern Chromatics'' (1879). These books were read with great enthusiasm by contemporary painters, particularly [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]], who put the theories into practice in their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;John Gage, ''Couleur et culture'', pp. 174–75&lt;/ref&gt;

File:GoetheFarbkreis.jpg|The color wheel designed by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1810) was based on the idea that the primary colors yellow and blue, representing light and darkness, were in opposition to each other.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===In art===
In 1872, [[Claude Monet]] painted ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'', a tiny orange sun and some orange light reflected on the clouds and water in the centre of a hazy blue landscape. This painting, with its striking use of the complementary colors orange and blue, gave its name to the [[impressionist]] movement. Monet was familiar with the science of complementary colors, and used them with enthusiasm. He wrote in 1888, "color makes its impact from contrasts rather than from its inherent qualities....the primary colors seem more brilliant when they are in contrast with their complementary colors."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, Histoire vivante des couleurs, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orange and blue became an important combination for all the impressionist painters. They all had studied the recent books on color theory, and they knew that orange placed next to blue made both colors much brighter. [[Auguste Renoir]] painted boats with stripes of chrome orange paint straight from the tube. [[Paul Cézanne]] used orange made of touches of yellow, red and ochre against a blue background.

[[Vincent van Gogh]] was especially known for using this technique; he created his own oranges with mixtures of yellow, ochre and red, and placed them next to slashes of sienna red and bottle green, and below a sky of turbulent blue and violet. He also put an orange moon and stars in a cobalt blue sky. He wrote to his brother Theo of "searching for oppositions of blue with orange, of red with green, of yellow with purple, searching for broken colors and neutral colors to harmonize the brutality of extremes, trying to make the colors intense, and not a harmony of greys."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent van Gogh, ''Lettres à Theo'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing his painting, ''[[The Night Café]]'', to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent van Gogh, ''Corréspondénce general'', number 533, cited by John Gage, ''Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Afterimages==
When one stares at a single color (red for example) for a sustained period of time (roughly thirty seconds to a minute), then looks at a white surface, an [[afterimage]] of the complementary color (in this case cyan) will appear. This is one of several [[Neural adaptation|aftereffect]]s studied in the [[psychology]] of [[visual perception]] which are generally ascribed to fatigue in specific parts of the visual system.

In the case above the [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s for red light in the [[retina]] are fatigued, lessening their ability to send the information to the brain. When white light is viewed, the red portions of light incident upon the eye are not transmitted as efficiently as the other wavelengths (or colors), and the result is the illusion of viewing the complementary color since the image is now biased by loss of the color, in this case red.&lt;!-- How does this inefficiency in viewing a specific color cause the complementary color to form? --&gt; As the receptors are given time to rest, the illusion vanishes. In the case of looking at the white light, red light is still incident upon the eye (as well as blue and green), however since the receptors for other light colors are also being fatigued, the eye will reach an equilibrium.

==Practical applications==
The use of complementary colors is an important aspect of [[aesthetic]]ally pleasing art and graphic design. This also extends to other fields such as contrasting colors in [[logo]]s and [[retailing|retail display]]. When placed next to each other, complements make each other appear brighter.

Complementary colors also have more practical uses. Because orange and blue are complementary colors, life rafts and life vests are traditionally orange, to provide the highest contrast and visibility when seen from ships or aircraft over the ocean.

Red and cyan glasses are used in the [[Anaglyph 3D]] system to produce 3D images on computer screens.

'''Comprachicos''' (also '''Comprapequeños''' and '''Cheylas''') is a compound [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[neologism]] meaning "child-buyers", which was coined by [[Victor Hugo]] in his novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]''.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal

The most common methods said to be used in this practice included stunting children's growth by [[physical restraint]], [[Muzzle (device)|muzzling]] their faces to deform them, slitting their eyes, dislocating their joints, and malforming their bones.&lt;ref name="Hugo"&gt;{{cite book

==Historical references==
[[Victor Hugo]]'s novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]'' is the story of a young aristocrat kidnapped and disfigured by his captors to display a permanent malicious grin. At the opening of the book, Hugo provides a description of the Comprachicos:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Comprachicos worked on man as the Chinese work on trees. A sort of fantastic stunted thing left their hands; it was ridiculous and wonderful. They could touch up a little being with such skill that its father could not have recognized it. Sometimes they left the spine straight and remade the face. Children destined for tumblers had their joints dislocated in a masterly manner; thus gymnasts were made. Not only did the Comprachicos take away his face from the child; they also took away his memory. At least, they took away all they could of it; the child had no consciousness of the mutilation to which he had been subjected. Of burnings by sulphur and incisions by the iron he remembered nothing. The Comprachicos deadened the little patient by means of a stupefying powder which was thought to be magical and which suppressed all pain.&lt;ref name="Hugo" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to research by John Boynton Kaiser in the Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology, "Victor
Hugo has given us a pretty faithful picture of many characteristic details of social England of the 17th century; but the word Comprachicos is used to describe a people whose characteristics are an unhistorical conglomeration of much that was once actual but then obsolete in the history of human society."&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; Much that seems unimaginable today may have authentic roots in common practices of the seventeenth century.

One of the common creations of the Comprachicos was supposed to be artificial dwarfs, formed "by anointing babies' spines with the grease of bats, moles and dormice" and using drugs such as "dwarf elder, [[knotgrass]], and daisy juice". The conception was known to [[Shakespeare]], as Beatrice K. Otto pointed out, quoting ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Get you gone, dwarf;&lt;br&gt;You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other means of creating this result were conjectured to include physical stunting by breaking or dislocating bones, and forcible constraint, whereby growth was inhibited for a long enough period to create permanent deformation. Because of the demand for dwarfs and other novelties in the courts of kings at this time, this could have been a profitable occupation.

==Modern references==

The term ''comprachico'' is very uncommonly used in modern English except in reference or allusion to the antiquated folklore {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}, but similar stories do exist in the English speaking world. For instance, a tale circulating since at least the 1980s tells of a [[Japan]]ese bride who disappears during her honeymoon in [[Europe]]; years later her husband discovers she has been abducted, mutilated, and forced to work in a freak show.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (November 12, 2006). [http://www.snopes.com/weddings/horrors/shanghai.asp "The Shanghai'd Bride"]. Snopes.com. Retrieved March 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Comprachico" has been adopted as a pejorative term used for individuals and entities who manipulate the minds and attitudes of children in a way that will permanently distort their beliefs or worldview. Twentieth-century philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] referred to educators of the time as "the Comprachicos of the mind" in her article "The Comprachicos". Her criticism was targeted especially toward [[Educational progressivism|educational progressivists]], but also grade-school and high-school educators who, in her view, used psychologically harmful methods of education.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn: "The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution", pp. 41–95. Signet/NAL/Penguin, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr005=vqt6kzx6s2.app7a&amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6151&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1069 Ayn Rand and her thoughts on Rational Education] Michael S. Berliner, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 album ''[[Immersion (album)|Immersion]]'' by [[Australia]]n [[Drum and Bass]] band [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], one of the songs was named "Comprachicos", where the lyrics had references to manipulation and restraint.

The 2011 DC comic Batman and Robin #26 contained a villain whose father disfigured him after reading about the "Comprachicos" in Hugo's novel.

[[James Ellroy]] refers to them and Victor Hugo's novel in ''[[The Black Dahlia (novel)|The Black Dahlia]]'' which forms a major motivation for the murder of Elizabeth Short.

'''Conceptual art''', sometimes simply called '''conceptualism''', is [[art]] in which the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called [[Installation art|installations]], may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302213039/http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|title=Wall Drawing 811 – Sol LeWitt|archivedate=2 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was fundamental to American artist [[Sol LeWitt]]'s definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

{{quotation|In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sol LeWitt]] "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art", ''Artforum'', June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Godfrey, author of ''Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)'' (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas) |author=Godrey, Tony |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-7148-3388-0 |publisher=London: Phaidon Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that [[Joseph Kosuth]] elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, ''Art after Philosophy'' (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the american editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969). Reprinted in Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and Movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Language, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]: Introduction (1969). Reprinted in Osborne (2002) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden: "Notes On Analysis" (1970). Reprinted in Osborne (2003), p. 237. E.g. "The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "conceptual art" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm ''Turner prize history: Conceptual art'' Tate gallery] tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that one of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".

[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art &amp; Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]
The French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym "R.Mutt", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).&lt;ref&gt;
Tony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28
&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future "conceptualists" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: "All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually".

In 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthapériste'' (or "infinite-aesthetics"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1961 the term "concept art", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this "dematerialization" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,&lt;ref&gt;
Lucy Lippard &amp; John Chandler, "The Dematerialization of Art", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218
&lt;/ref&gt;
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Conceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the "art" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's "written instructions" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |author= |date=March 1 – June 1, 2008 |work= |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art &amp; Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, "The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"&gt;Rorimer, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] "reinforced and legitimized" the direction the conceptual artists took.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2002), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who "powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories." Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, "The Construction of Change" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).

==Conceptual art and artistic skill==
[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art &amp; Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important difference between conceptual art and more "traditional" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramović]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Contemporary influence==
The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled "second- or third-generation" conceptualists, or "[[post-conceptual]]" artists.

Many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Art – The Art Story|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website=theartstory.org|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1917 : ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], described in an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' as the invention of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |title=The loo that shook the world: Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabi |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/the-loo-that-shook-the-world-duchamp-man-ray-picabi-784384.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (''Extra'') |date=2008-02-20 |pages=2–5 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1953 : [[Robert Rauschenberg]] creates ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]'', a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning]] which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist's work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only "art" because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series ''pièces de complices'', combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Demelas: Des mythes et des réalitées de l'avant-garde française. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1956 : [[Isidore Isou]] introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
* 1957: [[Yves Klein]], ''Aerostatic Sculpture (Paris)''. This was composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from [[Galerie Iris Clert]] to promote his ''Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch'' exhibition. Klein also exhibited 'One Minute Fire Painting' which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set. For his next major exhibition, ''The Void'' in 1958, Klein declared that his paintings were now invisible and to prove it he exhibited an empty room.
* 1958: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Das Theater ist auf der Straße''/''The theater is on the street''. The first [[Happening]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-morsbroich.de/index.php?id=vorschau&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_mbausstellungen_pi1%5Bexhibition%5D=40&amp;ftu=17c0865f7589ebcedf2cba1501860715|title=Vorschau – Museum Morsbroich|author=ChewingTheSun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1960: [[Yves Klein]]'s action called ''A Leap Into The Void'', in which he attempts to fly by leaping out of a window. He stated: "The painter has only to create one masterpiece, himself, constantly."
* 1960: The artist Stanley Brouwn declares that all the shoe shops in Amsterdam constitute an exhibition of his work.
* 1961: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Cityrama'', in Cologne was the first Happening in Germany.
* 1961: [[Robert Rauschenberg]] sent a telegram to the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] which said: 'This is a portrait of [[Iris Clert]] if I say so.' as his contribution to an exhibition of portraits.
* 1961: [[Piero Manzoni]] exhibited ''[[Artist's Shit]]'', tins purportedly containing his own [[feces]] (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as ''[[Corpo d'aria|Bodies of Air]]'', and signed people's bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Primo Levi]] are amongst the designated 'artworks'.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as [[Billy Apple]], erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.&lt;ref name="Byrt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' work. This consists of a barricade of oil barrels in a narrow Paris street which caused a large traffic jam. The artwork was not the barricade itself but the resulting traffic jam.
* 1962: [[Yves Klein]] presents ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle|Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity]]'' in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own 'pictorial sensitivity' (whatever that was, he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein's sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: [[Piero Manzoni]] created ''The Base of the World'', thereby exhibiting the entire planet as his artwork.
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1963: [[George Brecht]]'s collection of Event-Scores, ''[[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]]'', is published as the first ''Fluxkit'' by [[George Maciunas]]. 
* 1963: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.
* 1963: [[Henry Flynt]]s article ''Concept Art'' is published in ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''; a collection of artworks and concepts by artists and musicians that was published by [[Jackson Mac Low]] and [[La Monte Young]] (ed.). ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's "concept art" devolved from his idea of "cognitive nihilism" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.
* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: [[Art &amp; Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''Mirror Piece''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art &amp; Language – Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: A complex conceptual art piece by [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] called ''Still and Chew''. He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.
* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.
* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word "chair". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art &amp; Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966–67|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: [[N.E. Thing Co.]] Ltd. (Iain and Ingrid Baxter of Vancouver) exhibited ''Bagged Place'' the contents of a four-room apartment wrapped in plastic bags. The same year they registered as a corporation and subsequently organized their practice along corporate models, one of the first international examples of the "aesthetic of administration".
* 1967: [[Mel Ramsden]] first ''100% Abstract Paintings''. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitute the substance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-art-language-uncompleted/1/exhibitions/expo|title=ART &amp; LANGUAGE UNCOMPLETED|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: [[Sol LeWitt]]'s ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' were published by the American art journal ''[[Artforum]]''. The ''Paragraphs'' mark the progression from Minimal to Conceptual Art.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, [[Terry Atkinson]], [[David Bainbridge]] and [[Harold Hurrell]] found [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml|title=BBC – Coventry and Warwickshire Culture – Art and Language|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1968: [[Lawrence Weiner]] relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his "Declaration of Intent", one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt's "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice reads: "1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership."
* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.
* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.&lt;ref name="Byrt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.
* 1969: The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art &amp; Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the american editor.
* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.
* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]´s article "Art after Philosophy" in three parts (October–December). It became the most discussed article on "Conceptual Art".
* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like "Camptown Races" and "Some Enchanted Evening".
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.
* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted "an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.
* 1972: [[Art &amp; Language|The Art &amp; Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art &amp; Language]] and text-works from [[Art &amp; Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. 
* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.
* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.
* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.
* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.
* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.
* 1975–76: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art &amp; Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.
* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art &amp; Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art &amp; Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.
* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters. Despite its size, therefore, this work exists mostly in the viewer's mind.
* 1977: [[John Fekner]] creates hundreds of environmental and conceptual outdoor works consisting of stenciled words, symbols, dates and icons spray painted in New York, Sweden, Canada, England and Germany.
* 1986: [[Art &amp; Language]] are nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].

'''Creative computing''' covers the interdisciplinary area at the cross-over of the [[creative arts]] and [[computing]]. Issues of [[creativity]] include [[knowledge discovery]], for example.&lt;ref name="yang15"&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23766-4_7 | chapter=Knowledge Discovery in Creative Computing for Creative Tasks | first1=Lu | last1=Zhang | first2=Hongji | last2=Yang | authorlink2=Hongji Yang | title=Creativity in Intelligent, Technologies and Data Science | volume=535 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=Communications in Computer and Information Science | pages=93–104 | year=2015 | isbn=978-3-319-23765-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The ''International Journal of Creative Computing'' describes creative computing as follows:&lt;ref name="IJCrC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inderscience.com/ijcrc | title=International Journal of Creative Computing | publisher=[[Inderscience Publishers]] | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines.  People use computers as aids to  creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. Applications are seen in [[arts]], [[entertainment]]/[[games]], [[mobile applications]], [[multimedia]], product/[[web design]] and other [[interactive system]]s.&lt;!-- ICRC aims to shape a significant body of creative computing research. --&gt;}}

Creative computing is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature and topics relating to it include [[Application software|applications]], [[Software development|development method]], [[evaluation]], [[Conceptual model|modeling]], [[philosophy]], [[principle]]s, [[Operating environment|support environment]], and [[theory]].&lt;ref name="IJCrC" /&gt;

The term "creative computing" is used both in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (e.g., at [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/ | title=Creative Computing – An Introductory Computing Curriculum using Scratch | publisher=[[Harvard University]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ | title=Creative Computing | publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | work=[[MIT Media Lab]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Degree programmes==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2356">'''Cyberarts''' or '''cyberart''' refers to the class of art produced with the help of [[computer software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]], often with an interactive or [[multimedia]] aspect. 

==Overview==
The term "cyberarts" is vague and relatively [[neologism|new]]; nevertheless much of the work described by this term is rarely described any other way. For instance, a common type of cyberart which is produced programmatically by applying a set of design rules to a natural or preexisting process. A program could produce a few million such 'works of art' in a minute.

The word "CyberArts" is claimed as a registered trademark by [[Miller Freeman Inc.]], promoter of a series of muti-media technology conferences known as [[CyberArts International]] during the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Jacobson (ed.), ''CyberArts: Exploring Art and Technology.'' San Francisco, CA: Miller Freeman Inc., 1992; pg. ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

″Recent works of bioart propose to connect the viewer, transformed into a user, with different biological organisms by pirating their biometric data using digital interfaces. These immersive aesthetic propositions are based on a plural conception of the human body, forged in the crucible of cybernetics. Their new modes of communication explore the alternative path of an ecological continuum where the user enters a becoming-cyborg, far from the classic representations of human-machine coupling. They encourage us to reconsider the notion of bioart, in favor of ''cyberart''.″&lt;ref&gt; Teva Flaman &amp; Pierre-Luc Verville. ″Cyberart : du mode d’existence d’un devenir-cyborg.″ Inter, numéro 128, hiver 2018, p. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ethiopian Painting 2005 SeanMcClean.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A painting of performing debteras.]]
Debteras are usually chosen from families of other debteras, and are trained from childhood&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaufman Shelemay|first1=Kay|authorlink1=Kay Kaufman Shelemay|last2=Jeffery|first2=Peter|authorlink2=Peter Jeffery|title=Ethiopian Christian liturgical chant: an anthology: Part 2: Performance Practice; The Liturgical Portions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FFkFYKGv4XUC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1993|publisher=A-R Editions, Inc.|isbn=978-0-89579-294-5|pages=3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[scribe]]s&lt;ref name="Glazier124" /&gt; (learning [[Ge'ez]]&lt;ref name="Geleta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt;) and as [[cantor (Christianity)|cantors]].

Before services, they bathe and don white clothing, turbans,&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt; and a loose striped over-garment called a ''shamma''.  Debteras carry prayer sticks to the service, where they sing, dance, and play drums and [[sistrum|sistra]] outside the church or the [[synagogue]] during religious services.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p52-53" /&gt;

=== Among the Beta Israel ===
Among the Beta Israel, the status of debtera is a milestone in the study to become a [[kahen]]. Unlike fully-fledged Kahens (who perform none of the functions of ''debtra''), debteras are closer to the laypeople, often serving as intermediaries between them and the clergy. A Kahen who gives up his position or is deposed may serve as a ''debtera''.&lt;ref name="Greenfield"&gt;Isaac Greenfield, "The Debtera and the education among Ethiopian Jewry until the arrival of Dr. Faitlovitch" in Menachem Waldman (ed.), ''Studies in the History of Ethiopian Jews'', Habermann Institute of Literary Research, 2011, pp. 109-135 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Among Christians ===
''Kahens'' and ''debteras'' are two separate professions,&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro-Hay|first=Stuart|authorlink=Stuart Munro-Hay|title=Ethiopia, the Unknown Land: A Cultural and Historical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWNTfztz5KoC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-744-4|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is possible to pursue both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crummey|first=Donald|title=Land and Society in the Christian Kingdom of Ethiopia: From the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di0w6h0qHGMC&amp;pg=PA174|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-02482-5|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches see the division as following the model used by the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milkias|first=Paulos|title=Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iu9mnXhvSswC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-258-6|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Lenten services, ''debteras'' tap prayer sticks to keep the rhythm.  The Ethiopian Church condones the performances of ''debteras'', citing the story in [[2 Kings]] of [[David]] dancing at the temple and {{Bibleverse||Psalm|47:1|KJV}} ("[[Psalm 47|O clap your hands]]") for Biblical examples.  These performances also feature symbols connected to the [[Passion of Jesus]]: the sistrum's swaying and the beating of the drums represent Christ's swaying while enduring beatings, and the tapping of the prayer sticks represent the [[flagellation of Christ]].&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47" /&gt;

== Religio-Magical Healing ==
Debteras participate in liturgy as singers and musicians and, outside the Church religio-magical healers by performing as herbalists, astrologers, fortune-tellers etc. Some Ethiopian authors consider these healers as ‘spiritual healers’ whereas, they are purely religio-magical healers.&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"&gt;Janetius, S.T. Abyssinia in the New Millennium (Revised Edition), 2016. {{ISBN|9783659710629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all duties taken on by Debteras are condoned by the Ethiopian Church. Many distribute contraceptive herbs to women and perform magic meant to perform contraceptive functions, in contradiction to the Ethiopian Church's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l4WUdKWGcYsC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=pammUsXz-J&amp;dq=famous%20dabtaras&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=famous%20dabtaras&amp;f=false "Healer," Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N, by Siegbert Uhlig, publ. by Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2007, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are also reputed to study [[black magic]] invoking [[demon]]s alongside their more benevolent official learning.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

Some Debteras manufacture [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] [[amulet]]s meant to protect the wearer from evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;  These amulets are often made of silver and are noted for their use against the legendary [[Buda (folk religion)|budas]], [[zār]] spirits, and the [[evil eye]].  They may also study a variety of anti-magic invocations, [[prayer]]s, and exorcisms.  These exorcisms may include prayers, blessing of [[holy water]] (which the possessed person drinks), burning of roots, and incantations from a ''Magic Star Book''.&lt;ref name="Geleta" /&gt;  Some amulets may take the form of small scrolls kept in pouches or similar containers, made from the skin of a sacrificed goat or lamb whose blood is used to ritually purify the intended owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/?q=ethiopian-magic-scroll Description of Ethiopian Magic Scroll] at [[Portland State University]]'s [http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/ Medieval Portland site].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some practice (or rather circumvent) [[astrology]], by giving unlucky people new stars by changing their names.  This may be considered "cheating" by the locals, however.  Some Debteras have also been noted to use [[Datura stramonium]] to cause hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A debtera may charge a fee for his charms, exorcisms, and astrological practices, but not liturgical activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J00xEkY-vTEC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=debtera&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=debtera&amp;f=false A History of African Higher Education from Antiquity to the Present: A Critical Synthesis By G-m G-m Lulat, ABC-CLIO, 30 Aug 2005, p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the Debteras duties and cures are [[supernatural]].  Debteras place [[scarecrow]]s in farm fields to protect them and shave heads to prevent [[lice]] outbreaks.&lt;ref name="Finneran" /&gt;  Before the [[Derg|1974 revolution]], nobles would often hire Debteras to educate their children.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A major theological difference in the healing practices of Priests and Debteras is that for the priests, sin Vs virtue or evil-spirit Vs God is the basis for any sickness and healings. Therefore, they prescribe prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel), baptism (washing of sins), fasting, penance together with holy water as a remedy. For the debteras it is evil spirit Vs human beings; almost all the sickness are possession of evil spirits or caused by evil spirits, therefore, prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel) become the integral part of any ritualistic religious healing ceremony. Besides these, kitab or amulets are also prepared and give by them to be worn to wade away the evil spirits and evil eye (buda). On the other hand, the priests use the practice of confession, fasting, penance and Church attendance as a means of healing together with some sort of advice and guidance. The soul-father, called yenafs abbat is a kind of family spiritual-doctor, common in many places makes frequent visits to the home and performs services as required.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.in/Abyssinia-New-Millennium-Dr-Janetius/dp/1522757716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"/&gt;

The neighborhood is bounded by [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] to the north, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the west, [[Brooklyn Heights]] to the south and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 2]].

The area was originally a [[ferry]] landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, [[Sett (paving)|Belgian block]] streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer [[David Walentas]] and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art [[Art museum|galleries]], and currently a center for technology [[Startup company|startups]].

The large community of tech startups earned DUMBO the nickname of "the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle". In that time, Dumbo had become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New York City's fourth-richest community overall; this is owing in part to its large concentration of technology [[Startup company|startups]], its close proximity to Manhattan, and its large number of former industrial buildings that have been converted into spacious [[luxury real estate|luxury]] residential [[lofts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Nonko | first=Emily | title=The 8 Most Expensive Neighborhoods in New York City | website=New York.com | date=January 27, 2015 | url=http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971 | accessdate=November 7, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029075613/http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971/ | archivedate=October 29, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood is the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer [[Etsy]] and home furnishing stores company [[West Elm]].

==History==
The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Dumbo |url=http://dumbonyc.com/about |work=Dumbo NYC, Brooklyn |publisher=DumboNYC.com |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Olympia" name came from [[Comfort Sands|Comfort]] and [[Joshua Sands (politician)|Joshua Sands]], who bought the land in 1787&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Olympia Settlement in Early Brooklyn|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1929|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were planning to develop the land as a summer place for New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of American Biography|last = Johnson|first = Allen|publisher = Charles Scribner’s Sons|year = 1964|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 18th and 19th centuries, the area now known as Dumbo was considered part of [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]].&lt;ref name="HISTORICAL DISTRICTS 1966"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1966|title=HISTORICAL DISTRICTS|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20780654|journal=Real Property, Probate and Trust Journal|volume=1|issue=3|pages=204–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, the western portion of the neighborhood was known as [[Fulton Landing]], after the [[ferry]] stop that connected it to Manhattan before the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] opened. At that time, it was primarily a manufacturing district, with warehouses and factories that made machinery, paper boxes and [[Brillo]] soap pads. The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The [[cardboard box]] was invented in the Robert Gair building on Washington Street by Robert Gair, a Scottish emigrant; because of Gair's fame, the area was known as Gairsville for a long time.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The Gair building is now home to [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name="usa"/&gt;&gt;

The [[Jay Street Connecting Railroad]] ran through Dumbo's waterfront from circa 1904–1906 through 1957. It ran from rail yards beneath the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges to buildings near the waterfront in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. At the height of operations, it had spurs into several buildings, a [[car float bridge]] on Bridge Street, and a yard with capacity of 120 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jay Street Terminal / Jay Street Connecting Railroad | website=TrainWeb.org | date=November 30, 2017 | url=http://members.trainweb.com/bedt/indloco/jst.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/the-jay-street-connecting-railroad/|title=The Jay Street Connecting Railroad|first=William|last=Bryk|date=April 22, 2003|work=NY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were abandoned in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RAIL LINE TO END ITS BROOKLYN RUN; Jay Street Connecting Road Allowed to Discontinue Operations in Harbor | website=The New York Times | date=April 16, 1959 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/04/16/archives/rail-line-to-end-its-brooklyn-run-jay-street-connecting-road.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the railroad's tracks are still visible on streets in Dumbo.&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003/&gt;

With the [[deindustrialization]] of New York City, Dumbo began to become primarily residential; artists and other young homesteaders seeking relatively large and inexpensive [[loft apartment]] spaces for studios and homes began moving there in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt; The acronym "Dumbo" arose in 1978, when new residents coined it in the belief such an unattractive name would help deter developers.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

Near the end of the 20th century, as property became more and more expensive in Manhattan, Dumbo became increasingly [[gentrification|gentrified]]. Even so, the acronym 'Dumbo' was largely unknown as late as 1997, and the area itself was very inclusive, serving mainly as an enclave for artists located along the [[East River]] and under the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. At this stage there were still many air conditioner repair shops, auto shops, and "seedy back alleys and wharves"; and, because the neighborhood was still gentrifying from its industrial past, it lacked even a bookstore, coffee shop, or [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].&lt;ref name="nyt 19971010"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DC153CF933A25753C1A961958260&amp;pagewanted=all "As It Turns Artistic, A Noirish Enclave Steps Into the Light"].

'''''Dust Storm (Manter, Kansas)''''' is a 3D digital simulation work of art, by [[John Gerrard (artist)|John Gerrard]].

==History==
In 2008, the '''''Dust Storm''''' was shown at Artropolis, [[Chicago]].
In 2011, it was shown at [[Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts|PICA]], Perth, Australia, [[Ivorypress]], Madrid, Spain, and [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]].

==Analysis==
The 3D "hyperreal" portraits depict beautiful landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063628/IRE_280_008.html|title=Dust Storm (Manter, Kansas)|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Dust Storm unites a classic image from the Great Depression with a contemporary industrial landscape, setting them in a cosmological orbit that is completed over the full spectrum of a year. The exploitation of oil that goes back to the beginning of the 20th Century is presented as the catalyst of conditions that led to the ecological disaster of Dust Bowl. But nothing is didactic. The pity in the subject comes to viewers subliminally through a visual poem of complexity and power.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-04-26/features/0804250596_1_folk-and-outsider-art-dust-storm-galleries&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Et nous aussi nous serons meres Lequeu.jpg|thumb|''And we too, shall be mothers, because.......!'' by [[Jean-Jacques Lequeu]], 1794]]
[[File:Achille Devéria erotism.jpg|thumb|200px|right|&lt;center&gt;In [[Achille Devéria]]'s "libertine watercolor" the explicit [[Cunnilingus|erotic scene]] is taking place clandestinely against the background of a "respectable" party seen at the back&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Erotic art''' covers any [[Work of art|artistic work]] that is intended to evoke [[Sexual arousal|erotic arousal]] or that depicts scenes of [[human sexuality|sexual activity]]. It is a type of [[erotica]] and includes drawings, engravings, films, paintings, photographs, and sculptures, and writing.

==Definition==
{{details|Erotic literature}}
The definition of erotic art is somewhat subjective, and dependent on context, since perceptions of both what is ''erotic'' and what is ''art'' vary. For example, a sculpture of a [[phallus]] in some cultures may be considered a traditional symbol of potency rather than overtly erotic. Material that is produced to illustrate [[sex education]] may be perceived by others as inappropriately erotic.

A distinction is often made between erotic art and [[pornography]], which also depicts scenes of sexual activity and is intended to evoke erotic arousal, but is not usually considered [[fine art]]. Some draw a distinction based on the work's intent and message: erotic art would be works intended for purposes in addition to arousal, which could be appreciated as art by someone uninterested in their erotic content. [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Potter Stewart]] famously wrote that the distinction was intuitive, saying about hard-core pornography which would not be legally protected as erotic art, "I know it when I see it"&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobellis v. Ohio'', 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
{{details|History of erotic depictions#Early depictions|Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum}}
Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are [[Paleolithic]] cave paintings and carvings, but many cultures have created erotic art. Artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Inana|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-1705-6|pages=150-152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0313294976|page=137|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glyptic art from the [[Sumer]]ian [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the [[missionary position]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; In Mesopotamian [[Ex-voto|votive plaques]] from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking [[beer]] through a straw.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; [[Assyria|Middle Assyrian]] lead votive [[figurine]]s often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of [[Hieros gamos|ritual sex]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of [[Inanna]], the goddess of sex and prostitution.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at [[Assur]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; which also contained models of male and female sexual organs,&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; including stone [[phallus|phalli]], which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate [[Cult image|cult statues]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; and clay models of the female [[vulva]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;

Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art,&lt;ref name="Gay1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robins|first1=Gay|title=Women in Ancient Egypt|date=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-95469-6|pages=189-190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTSA88SVHCMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Turin+erotic+papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMmKPkn8HYAhXLQt8KHePuB48Q6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Turin%20erotic%20papyrus&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The [[Turin Erotic Papyrus]] (Papyrus 55001) is a {{convert|8.5|ft|m}} by {{convert|10|in|cm}} Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at [[Deir el-Medina]],&lt;ref name=oconnor2001&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=David|title=Eros in Egypt|url=http://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/eros_in_egypt.htm|website=Archaeology Odyssey|date=September–October 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s showing men and women in various [[sexual position]]s.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; The men in the illustrations are "scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy" with exaggeratedly large genitalia&lt;ref name=schmidt2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Robert A.|last2=Voss|first2=Barbara L.|date=2000|title=Archaeologies of Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSBVQpifqhkC&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Turin%20Papyrus%22&amp;f=false|location=Abingdon-on-Thames, England|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-22366-9|page=254|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness,&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; but the women are [[nubile]]&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic [[iconography]], such as [[convolvulus]] leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with [[Hathor]], the goddess of love, such as [[lotus flower]]s, monkeys, and [[sistra]].&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC)&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt;

The ancient [[Greeks]] painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty, and there are numerous sexually explicit paintings on the walls of ruined Roman buildings in [[Pompeii]]. The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of [[Peru]] in [[South America]] are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, M., Leslie, J. &amp; Butts, S. (2005) ''Pornography: the Secret History of Civilization'' [DVD], Koch Vision.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entire gallery devoted to pre-Columbian erotic ceramics ([[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture) in [[Lima]] at the [[Larco Museum]].

Additionally, there has been a long tradition of erotic painting in Eastern cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity until the late 19th century when photography was invented.&lt;ref name = shunga&gt;{{cite web| title = Shunga| publisher = Japanese art net and architecture users system| year = 2001| url = http://www.aisf.or.jp/%7Ejaanus/deta/s/shunga.htm| accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the erotic art of [[China]] reached its popular peak during the latter part of the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertholet, L. C. P. (1997) "Dreams of Spring: Erotic Art in China," in: ''Bertholet Collection'', Pepin Press (October, 1997) {{ISBN|90-5496-039-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], the famous [[Kama Sutra]] is an ancient sex manual that is still popularly read throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Daniélou, A., trans. (1993) ''The Complete Kama Sutra: the first unabridged modern translation'', Inner Traditions. {{ISBN|0-89281-525-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fellatiomoche.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Moche (culture)|Moche]] ceramic depicting fellatio, ca. 200 AD, [[Larco Museum]] Collection]]
In Europe, starting with the [[Renaissance]], there was a tradition of producing [[erotica]] for the amusement of the aristocracy. In the early 16th century, the text ''[[I Modi]]'' was a [[woodcut]] album created by the designer [[Giulio Romano]], the engraver [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and the poet [[Pietro Aretino]]. In 1601 [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]] painted the "[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Vincit Omnia]]," for the collection of the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.

An erotic cabinet, ordered by [[Catherine the Great]], seems to have been adjacent to her suite of rooms in the [[Gatchina Palace]]. The furniture was highly eccentric with tables that had large penises for legs. Penises and vaginas were carved on the furniture. The walls were covered in erotic art. The rooms and the furniture were seen in 1941 by two Wehrmacht-officers but they seem to have vanished since then.&lt;ref&gt;Igorʹ Semenovich Kon and James Riordan, ''Sex and Russian Society'' page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4512/Cultuur/archief/article/detail/1775415/2003/12/06/Het-Geheim-van-Catherina-de-Grote.dhtml|title=Het Geheim van Catherina de Grote|newspaper=Trouw|author=Peter Dekkers|date=6 December 2003|trans-title=The Secret of Catherine the Great|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary by Peter Woditsch suggests that the cabinet was in the [[Peterhof Palace]] and not in Gatchina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret of Catherine the Great|url=http://www.deproductie.nl/en/films/het-geheim-van-catherina-de-grote/|last=Woditsch|first=Peter|website=De Productie|accessdate=8 July 2014}} Includes trailer of the documentary by Peter Woditsch.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition was continued by other, more modern painters, such as [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]], [[Balthus]], [[Picasso]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Egon Schiele]]. Schiele served time in jail and had several works destroyed by the authorities for offending contemporary mores with his depictions of nude girls.

By the 20th century, photography became the most common medium for erotic art. Publishers like [[Taschen]] mass-produced erotic illustrations and [[erotic photography]].

==Modern==
[[File:Ciągliński Symbolic dance.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Symbolic dance'' by [[Jan Ciągliński]], late 19th-century subtle [[lesbian]] erotica ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]).]]
Today, erotic artists thrive, although in some circles, much of the genre is still not as well accepted as the more standard genres of art such as portraiture and landscape. During the last few centuries, society has broadened its view of what can be considered as art and several new styles developed during the 19th century such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]]. This has given today's artists a broad variety of genres from which to choose, including; [[Fantasy art|fantasy]], [[Pinup art|pinup]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Fetish art|fetish]], [[Adult comics|comics]], [[anime]], [[hentai]], and many other niche genres all with erotic elements.

Classic "war-era" pin-ups like the works of [[Alberto Vargas]], [[Gil Elvgren]] and [[Baron Von Lind]], are still as popular as their contemporaries: [[Bunny Yeager]], [[Greg Hildebrandt]], [[Olivia De Berardinis]], [[Hajime Sorayama]], [[Aslan (artist)|Alain Aslan]], and [[List of pin-up artists|others]].

The acceptance and popularity of erotic art has pushed the genre into mainstream pop-culture and has created many famous icons. [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Luis Royo]], [[Boris Vallejo]], [[Chris Achilleos]], and [[Clyde Caldwell]] are among the artists whose work has been widely distributed.  The Guild of Erotic Artists were formed in 2002 to bring together a body of like minded individuals whose sole purpose was to express themselves and promote the sensual art of erotica for the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen: ''Erotic Art.'' Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, [[New York City|New York]] 1993, {{ISBN|0-88184-970-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2015 [[sexologist]] and [[gallerist]] [[Laura Henkel]], curator of the [[Erotic Heritage Museum]] and the Sin City Gallery, organised 12 Inches of Sin, an exhibition focussing on art that expresses a diverse view of sexuality and challenging ideas of high and low art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/las-vegas-sexologist-art|title=One Sexologist’s Quest to Stimulate Las Vegas’ Art Scene|website=The Creators Project|author=Alyssa Buffenstein|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Henkel collaborated with former [[MoMA]] curator and art historian Rosa JH Berland to create the Modern Provocateur Manifesto, that describes artwork that is about human sexuality.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Legal standards==
Whether or not an instance of erotic art is [[obscene]] depends on the standards of the jurisdisction and community in which it is displayed.

In the [[United States]], the 1973 ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established a three-tiered [[Miller test|test]] to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;
The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. California'', 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As this is still much more vague than other judicial tests within U.S. jurisprudence, it has not reduced the conflicts that often result, especially from the ambiguities concerning what the "contemporary community standards" are. Similar difficulties in distinguishing between erotica and obscenity have been found in other legal systems.

'''Flash fiction''' is a fictional work of extreme brevity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://shortstories.about.com/od/Flash/a/What-Is-Flash-Fiction.htm|title=What Is Flash Fiction?|author=Catherine Sustana|date=|work=About Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; that still offers character and plot development.  Identified varieties, many of them defined by [[word count]], include the [[For sale: baby shoes, never worn|six-word story]],&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bridportprize.org.uk/blog/flash-fiction-all-you-ever-wanted-know-were-afraid-ask|author=Graham|date=  March 8, 2013|work=The Bridport Prize|title=Flash fiction - all you ever wanted to know, but were afraid to ask...}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 280-character story (also known as "[[twitterature]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/twitter-fiction_n_7205686|author=Maddie Crum|date=  May 7, 2015|work=The Huffington Post|title=Twitter Fiction Reveals The Power Of Very, Very Short Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the "dribble" (also known as the "[[minisaga]]"; 50 words),&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; the "[[drabble]]" (also known as "microfiction"; 100 words),&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; "sudden fiction" (750 words),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/publishing-tips/flash-fiction-whats-it-all-about|author=Becky Tuch |date=|work=The Review Review|title=Flash Fiction: What's It All About?}}&lt;/ref&gt; flash fiction (1,000 words), nanotale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theanonymouswriter.com/nanotales/|title=Nanotales|last=Chakraborty|first=Abhijit|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "micro-story".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Two Micro-Stories by [[Bolesław Prus]]," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1995, no. 1, pp. 99-103.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some commentators have suggested that flash fiction possesses a unique literary quality, in its ability to hint at or imply a larger story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smokelong.com/why-flash-fiction-because-of-a-parrot-and-a-porn-star-of-course/#_edn3|title=Why Flash Fiction?

Norton, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Flash fiction has roots going back to prehistory, recorded at origin of writing, including [[fable]]s and [[parable]]s, notably ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' in the west, and [[Panchatantra]] and [[Jataka tales]] in India. Later examples include the tales of [[Nasreddin]], and [[Zen]] [[koan]]s such as ''[[The Gateless Gate]]''.

In the United States, early forms of flash fiction can be found in the 19th century, notably in the figures of [[Walt Whitman]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], and [[Kate Chopin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Specimen Fiction: The 19th Century Tradition of the American Short-Short Story Critical Essay with Creative Work |last=Roth |first=Forrest Stephen
|type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Louisiana at Lafayette |year=2013 |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/35/90/3590051.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s flash fiction was referred to as the "short short story" and was associated with ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine; and in the 1930s, collected in anthologies such as ''The American Short Short Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofw2AQAAIAAJ |title=The American Short Short Story - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Somerset Maugham]] was a notable proponent, with his ''Cosmopolitans: Very Short Stories'' (1936) being an early collection. 

In Japan, flash fiction was popularized in the post-war period particularly by {{Nihongo|Michio Tsuzuki|[[:ja:都筑道夫|都筑道夫]]}}.

Hemingway also wrote 18 pieces of flash fiction that were included in his first short-story collection, ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]''. It is disputed whether (to win a bet), as alleged, he also wrote the flash fiction "[[For sale: baby shoes, never worn|For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never Worn]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/babyshoes.asp |title=Ernest Hemingway - Baby Shoes |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also notable are the 62 "short-shorts" which comprise ''Severance,'' the thematic collection by [[Robert Olen Butler]] in which each story describes the remaining 90 seconds of conscious awareness within human heads which have been decapitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/books/review/Barbash.t.html?_r=0|title=Dead Heads|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English speaking writers well known for their published flash fiction include [[Lydia Davis]], [[David Gaffney]] and [[Robert Scotellaro]] and online include [[Sherrie Flick]], [[Bruce Holland Rogers]], [[Steve Almond]], [[Barbara Henning]], [[Grant Faulkner]], and [[Nancy Stohlman]].

Spanish-speaking literature has many authors of microstories, including [[Augusto Monterroso]] ("El dinosaurio") and [[Luis Felipe Lomelí]] ("[[El emigrante (short story)|El Emigrante]]"). Their microstories are some of the shortest ever written in that language. In Spain, authors of ''microrrelatos'' (very short fictions) have included [[Andrés Neuman]], [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]], [[José Jiménez Lozano]], [[Javier Tomeo]], [[José María Merino]], [[Juan José Millás]], and [[Óscar Esquivias]].&lt;ref name="Vall2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Valls|first=Fernando|title=Mar de pirañas|url=http://www.diariodeleon.es/noticias/filandon/las-voces-del-microrrelato_735678.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|year=2012|publisher=Menoscuarto|isbn=8496675890|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his collection ''La mitad del diablo'' (Páginas de Espuma, 2006), [[:es:Juan Pedro Aparicio|Juan Pedro Aparicio]] included the one-word story [[:es:Luis XIV|Luis XIV]], which in its entirety reads: "Yo" ("I"). In Argentina, notable contemporary contributors to the genre have included [[Marco Denevi]], [[Luisa Valenzuela]], and [[Ana María Shua]].

The Italian writer [[Italo Calvino]] consciously searched for a short narrative form, drawing inspiration from Argentine writers [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] and finding that Monterroso's was "the most perfect he could find"; "El dinosaurio", in turn, possibly inspired his "The Dinosaurs".&lt;ref name="Weiss1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Beno|title=Italo Calvino|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRewK6x7HQUC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=9 November 2012|year=1993|publisher=U of South Carolina P|isbn=9780872498587|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and [[Francophone]] countries, ''micronouvelles'' have been popularized by authors such as [[Jacques Fuentealba]] and [[Vincent Bastin]].&lt;ref&gt;Irène Langlet, "Les Echelles de bâti de la science-fiction," in ''Revue française de Fixxion contemporaine - Critical Review of Contemporary Franch Fixxion'', n° 1, ''Micro/Macro,'' 2011 and Cristina Alvarez, "Nouveaux genres littéraires urbains - les nouvelles en trois lignes contemporaines au sein des micronouvelles," in ''Atas do Simpósio Internacional : Microcontos e outras microformas,'' Minho (Portugal), {{ISBN|978-972-8063-65-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German-language authors of ''Kürzestgeschichten,'' influenced by brief narratives penned by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Franz Kafka]], have included [[Peter Bichsel]], [[Heimito von Doderer]], [[Günter Kunert]], and [[Helmut Heißenbüttel]].

The [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking world has produced a number of micro-story authors, including the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Egyptian author [[Naguib Mahfouz]], whose book ''Echoes of an Autobiography'' is composed mainly of such stories. Other flash fiction writers in Arabic include [[Zakaria Tamer]], [[Haidar Haidar]], and [[Laila al-Othman]].

In the Russian-speaking world the best known flash fiction author is [[Linor Goralik]].

In the southwestern [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Kerala]] [[:ml:പി.കെ._പാറക്കടവ്|PK Parakkadavu]] is known for his many micro-stories in the [[Malayalam|Malayalam language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Through the Mini-Looking Glass|last=Parakkadavu|first=PK|publisher=Lead Books|year=2013|isbn=|location=Kozhikode|pages=|translator-last=VK Sreelesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
A number of print journals dedicate themselves to flash fiction. These include ''Flash: The International Short-Short Story Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hassacc.com/archive/?vid=1&amp;aid=3&amp;kid=150201-19&amp;q=f1.|title=Flash Fiction: Literary fast food or a metamodern (sub)genre with potential?|author=Bente Lucht|date=November 17, 2014|work=Human And Social Sciences at the Common Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Vestal Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/publishing-tips/flash-fiction-list-resources|title=Flash Fiction: A List of Resources|author=Becky Tuch|date=|work=The Review Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
Access to the Internet has enhanced an awareness of flash fiction, with online journals being devoted entirely to the style. ''SmokeLong Quarterly'', founded by Dave Clapper in 2003, is "dedicated to bringing the best flash fiction to the web ... whether written by widely published authors or those new to the craft."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Smoke Break: Guest Editors Choose Flash Fiction for Online Mag|last = Hart|first = Melissa|date = March 2016|journal = The Writer (Retrieved 2016-02-11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other online flash fiction journals include ''wigleaf'', ''Flash Fiction Online'' and ''Flash Fiction Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pratt |first=Mary K. |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/164355/how_technology_is_changing_what_we_read.html |title=How Technology Is Changing What We Read |publisher=PCWorld |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A comprehensive list of online magazines accepting flash fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dlshirey.com/the-short-list/|title=The Short List|author=DL Shirey|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Paulo Coelho]] remarked that the "democratization of communication offered by the Internet has made positive in-roads" and directly influenced the style's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/15/short.stories/index.html |title=Six of the best: CNN readers tell us their stories | date=2008-08-18 |publisher=Cnn.com| accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form is popular, with most online literary journals now publishing flash fiction.

Social media has also enabled a rapid spread of the genre, with publishers such as [[The Anonymous Writer]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9rKkPPIbs|title=The Anonymous Writer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Third Word Press]] using flash-fiction to create stories on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/news/LIF-satirical-lines-showing-indian-hypocrisy-5088229-PHO.html|title=6 nanotales by anonymous writers show reality of Indian hypocrisy!|date=2015-08-19|work=DailyBhaskar|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/featured-blog/micro-fiction-the-new-age-writing-fad/1075708|title=Micro fiction: The new-age writing fad {{!}} Free Press Journal|website=www.freepressjournal.in|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.third-word.com/|title=The Third Word Press |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' ran a series of flash fiction [http://www.newyorker.com/books/flash-fiction stories] online.

'''Fugitive pigments''' are [[wikt:impermanent|impermanent]] [[pigment]]s that lighten, darken, or otherwise change in appearance or physicality over time when exposed to certain environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, humidity, or pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Field|first=George|title=Field's Chromatography or Treatise on Colours and Pigments as Used by Artists|year=1869|publisher=Project Guttenberg|location=London|page=31|url=http://www.gutenberg.org|edition=Salter's|editor=Thomas W.

Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|page=59|url=http://www.getty.edu|author=Tiarna Doherty|edition=Revised|author2=Anne T. Woollett}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fugitive pigments are present in types of [[paint]], [[Marker pen|marker]]s, [[ink]]s etc., which are used for temporary applications. Fugitive inks which washed away when soaked in water were sometimes used deliberately to prevent [[postage stamp]]s being removed from envelopes by soaking, and reused (e.g., the [[Queen Victoria Lilac and Green Issue]]).

While permanent pigments are usually used for [[painting]]s, painters have made work wholly or partially with fugitive pigments for a number of reasons: availability and cost of pigments; being more concerned with the appearance of colors available only with fugitive pigments than with permanence; ignorance regarding the volatility of the pigments; or the desire to have a painting change in appearance over time.

A '''hierarchy of genres''' is any formalization which ranks different  [[genre]]s in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[History painting]], including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*[[Portrait painting]]
*[[Genre works|Genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|Landscape]] and cityscape art (landscapists were called "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" by the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]])
*[[Animal painting]]
*[[Still life]]

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scènes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fêtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the Académie française when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

A '''holy well''' or '''sacred spring''' is a [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] or other small body of water revered either in a [[Christian]] or [[Paganism|pagan]] context, sometimes both. The term ''holy well'' is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the [[folklore]] of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated [[legend]], the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the [[numen|numinous]] presence of its guardian spirit or Christian [[saint]], or a ceremony or [[ritual]] centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the [[hagiography]] of Celtic saints.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The term ''haeligewielle'' is in origin an [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] toponym attached to specific springs in the landscape;&lt;ref&gt;J. Harte, 'Holey Wells and other Holey Places', ''Living Spring Journal'', 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; its current use has arisen through folklore scholars, [[antiquarians]], and other writers generalising from those actual 'Holy Wells' which survived into the modern era. The term 'holy-hole' is sometimes employed.&lt;ref  name="ARoss"&gt;A. Ross, ''Pagan Celtic Britain'' (London: RKP), 1967, 107; Willy Worcestre, ''Itinerary'', ed. J. Harvey (Oxford: Clarendon), 1981, pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms '[[hole (disambiguation)|hole]]' and '[[holy]]' are [[etymon]]s.

==Culture and representation==
Holy wells in different forms occur in such a wide variety of cultures, religious environments, and historical periods that it is usually held that it is a universal human instinct to revere sources of water.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. J. &amp; C. Bord, ''Sacred Waters'' (London: Granada), 1985, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the fragmentary nature of the evidence, and the historical differences among cultures and nations, make it very hard to generalize.  While there are a few national studies of holy well lore and history, mainly concentrating on [[Ireland]] and the [[British Isles]], there is a need for more work examining other regions.

The earliest work specifically devoted to holy wells is [[Philip Dixon Hardy]]'s ''Holy Wells of Ireland'' (1836), a [[Protestant]] attack on [[Catholic]] observances at Irish wells bearing the names of Christian [[saints]], or otherwise considered sacred. By the later 19th century, the term had acquired its current usage: Robert Charles Hope's ''The Legendary Lore of the Holy Wells of England'' (1893), the first general survey of its kind, included a number of named wells which were not dedicated to saints (as well as some rivers and lakes with associated folklore, as Hope mentioned in his subtitle).

==Exegesis==
In [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] a [[nymphaeum]] or nymphaion ({{lang-el|νυμφαίον}}), was a [[monument]] consecrated to the [[nymph]]s, especially those of [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]].

In England, there are examples of reverence for wells and springs at a variety of historical periods. The medieval traveller [[William Worcester|William of Worcester]] saw a 'holy-hole, or well' within the cave at [[Wookey]] ([[Somerset]]), a site of human habitation in the [[Palaeolithic]] era and the source of a river which had been the site of ritual activity.&lt;ref  name="ARoss"/&gt; The proximity of named springs to [[Neolithic]] or [[Iron Age]] monuments, such as the Swallowhead Springs, close to [[Silbury Hill]] ([[Wiltshire]]) or the Holy Well near Tadmarton Hill ([[Oxfordshire]]), suggests that reverence for such sites continued without a break. There is abundant evidence for the importance of wells and springs in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman period]], not just at temple complexes such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (Somerset), [[Chedworth]] ([[Gloucestershire]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Living Spring Journal'' '''2''', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and Blunsdon Ridge ([[Wiltshire]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | place = UK | url = http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind9905&amp;L=wells-and-spas&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=4844 | title = Wells and Spas Archives | publisher = Jiscmail | date = May 1999 | issue = 46 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230839/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind9905&amp;L=wells-and-spas&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=4844 | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; which have medicinal springs at their centre, but a variety of smaller sites, and at wells and ritual shafts used for [[Superstition|superstitious]] and sub-religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Merrifield, R. (1987) ''The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic''. London: Batsford; pp. 23–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stinanswellirvine1.JPG|left|thumb|Saint Inans Well, Irvine, Scotland. Dated 839 AD.]]
Christianity strongly affected the development of holy wells in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. Aside from the spring that issued from the staff of Moses and the Well of [[Beersheba]], there were already a number of sites mentioned in Jewish  and Christian folklore, including [[Moses]]' well near [[Mount Nebo]], visited by the fourth-century nun [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] and many other pilgrims. St [[Athanasius]]' Life of St [[Anthony the Great|Antony]], written about 356–62, mentions the well created by the desert hermit Antony. It is unclear how many Christian holy wells there may have been, as records are very fragmentary and often a well appears only once, making it impossible to tell when reverence for it began and when it ceased, but by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] England, for instance, probably possessed some hundreds. As they were closely linked with the cults of the saints, many wells in countries that converted to Protestant forms of Christianity fell into disuse and were lost, the Holy Well at [[Walsingham]] ([[Norfolk]]) being a good example, which, having been an integral element of the pilgrimage to the shrine of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the village, vanished completely. Nevertheless, this particular holy well at the [[Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham]] was restored nearby the original site and its water is known for its [[faith healing|healing]] properties, thus making it a popular site of Christian [[Christian pilgrimage|religious pilgrimage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Philip|title=Streams of Healing Grace|year=2017|publisher=Walsingham Review|language=English |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting of wells for therapeutic and entertainment purposes did not completely die out, however, as [[spa]]s became fashionable in the 17th century and later. Eventually [[antiquarians]] (from the 17th century) and folklorists (from the 19th) began to take notice of holy wells and record their surviving traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Rattue, J. (1995) ''The Living Stream'' Woodbridge: Boydell, chapters 7, 8, and 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a hundred holy wells exist in [[Cornwall]], each associated with a particular saint, though not always the same one as the dedication of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Jenner|Jenner, Henry]] (1925) "The Holy Wells of Cornwall". In: ''Cornish Church Guide''. Truro: Blackford; pp. 249-257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mabel Quiller-Couch|Quiller-Couch, Mabel]] &amp; Lilian (1894) ''Ancient and Holy Wells of Cornwall''. London: Chas. J. Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several holy wells also survive in [[Turkey]], called ''ayazma'' in [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁγίασμα}} (''hagiasma''), literally "holiness". Examples of ''hagiasmata'' are found in the [[Church of St. Mary of the Spring (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of the Spring]] and the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]], both located in [[istanbul]].

==Historiographical controversies==
The [[Protestant Reformers]] of the 16th century often assumed that medieval Catholic practices embodied lingering remains of [[pagan]] religious practices, and thought of holy wells in that way.&lt;ref name="Carroll2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Michael P.|title=American Catholics in the Protestant Imagination: Rethinking the Academic Study of Religion|date=29 December 2010|publisher=JHU Press|language=English |isbn=9781421401997|page=1878}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affected the outlook of those who came to study holy well traditions later. The pioneers of folklore study took the view that the customs and legends they were recording were debased versions of pagan rites and myths. Thus it became standard to begin any account of holy wells with the statement that the Christian church had adopted them from the pagans and replaced the heathen gods with Christian saints, in order to win people over to the new religion more smoothly.

[[File:Dupath well cornwall.jpg|right|thumb|Dupath Well in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, J. Charles (1912), ''Porches &amp; Fonts.='' London: Wells Gardner &amp; Darton; p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Among the earliest enthusiasts for holy wells in modern times was the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] movement, for whom wells formed part of '[[earth mysteries]]' study along with [[ley line]]s and ancient sites; the view that the Christians had 'stolen' holy wells from the pagan religions fitted in well with their position.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rattue, ''The Living Stream'' (Woodbridge: Boydell), 1995, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazines ''Wood and Water'' and ''[[Meyn Mamvro]]'', among others, helped shape this approach. During the early- and mid-1990s this viewpoint was under increasing attack crowned by the publication of [[Ronald Hutton]]'s ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'' (1991) which argued that the evidence for what constituted pre-Christian British religious practices, certainly outside Romano-British times, was next to nil.&lt;ref name="Hutton1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV-IQgAACAAJ|accessdate=25 March 2017|year=1991|publisher=B. Blackwell|language=English |isbn=9780631172888}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as wells themselves were concerned, the controversy emerged in the pages of ''Source'', the holy wells journal edited by Roy Fry and former [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] Tristan Gray-Hulse. A number of articles in the journal challenged long-standing myths about holy well history, and the editors published an exchange between the authors and Cheryl Straffon, editor of Cornish earth mysteries magazine ''Meyn Mamvro'', about the evidence for a particular Cornish well's supposed association with the Irish goddess [[Brigid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.bath.ac.uk/liskmj/living-spring/sourcearchive/ns3/ns3cs1.htm|title=The Search for Bride's Well|website=people.bath.ac.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124142915/http://people.bath.ac.uk/liskmj/living-spring/sourcearchive/ns3/ns3cs1.htm|archivedate=2017-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eco-pagan movement has largely accepted the new historiographical approach,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} but occasionally rather more old-fashioned accounts of holy wells are published, for instance Gary Varner's ''Sacred Springs'' (2002).

A linked argument was over the nature of the influence of the [[Celt]]s on the well cult. The late Francine Nicholson, an independent student of Celtica, argued forcefully and controversially that the Celts had a unique sensitivity to sacred wells, but never elaborated this in any published work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0301&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;P=2193 WELLS-AND-SPAS Archives - January 2003 (#23)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230605/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0301&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3&amp;P=2193 |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, radically minded scholars have begun questioning the unity of concepts imposed by the term 'holy well'. In a paper in the ''Living Spring Journal'', Jeremy Harte distinguishes between early Anglo-Saxon 'holy wells' and those Christianised in the late Middle Ages, and argues 'apart from being venerated and being wet, they have little in common'; Harte has also stressed that limited evidence may mean that scholars are considerably overestimating the number of holy wells which were active at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0703&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;P=R924&amp;D=0&amp;H=0&amp;I=-3&amp;O=T&amp;T=0&amp;m=2725 Harte, op.cit.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230613/http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0703&amp;L=WELLS-AND-SPAS&amp;P=R924&amp;D=0&amp;H=0&amp;I=-3&amp;O=T&amp;T=0&amp;m=2725 |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival of modern interest==
[[File:St Peter's Well, Houston - view from the east &amp; opening.jpg|thumb|left|250px|St Peter's Well at Houstin in Scotland. A rare Scottish covered well.]]
In a sense, the restoration of holy wells began almost as soon as they were in decline, as a number became the subject of antiquarian interest and some were turned into garden features and put to other decorative uses. However, in more modern times wells have been restored as an expression of interest in the past, sometimes from [[Romanticism|romantic]] or religious motives, but mostly as a statement of continuity with the history of a particular community. A good example is St Osyth's Well at [[West Bierton]] ([[Buckinghamshire]]), 'restored' (and in the process rebuilt completely) by the Parish Council as part of a project marking [[Millennium]] Year in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rattue, ''Holy Wells of Buckinghamshire'' (High Wycombe: Umbra), 2003, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most active holy wells in Britain are those linked to Christian [[pilgrimages]], at Walsingham, [[Fernyhalgh]] ([[Lancashire]]) and [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] ([[Wales]]), or popular tourist sites (Bath, Somerset). The [[Chalice Well]] at [[Glastonbury]] (Somerset) is at the centre of a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]]- and [[New Age]]-orientated spirituality and retreat centre. Other wells, however, are often visited on an informal basis for religious or sightseeing reasons. New forms of holy well reverence continue to emerge now and again, notoriously the so-called Well of the [[Triple deities|Triple Goddess]] at [[Minster-in-Sheppey]] ([[Kent]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cassandraeason.co.uk/sacred_waters.htm Sacred waters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607191656/http://www.cassandraeason.co.uk/sacred_waters.htm |date=2007-06-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Channel 4's archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' was responsible for exposing the infamous archaeological fraud of [[Llygadwy]], a site which included an alleged holy well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/2001llyg.html Channel 4 – ''Time Team''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227044755/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/2001llyg.html |date=2011-02-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historiographically, the publication of Janet and Colin Bord's ''Sacred Waters'' (1985) was influential in reviving interest in the history and folklore of holy wells in Britain. The same year saw the foundation of the journal ''Source'' by Mark Valentine. Attempts to maintain a regular journal for the study of holy wells have been erratic (''Source'' enjoyed two runs from 1985–89 and 1994–98, and the web-based Living Spring has only had two issues to date) but postings on websites such as The Megalithic Portal show that there is still much interest in this category of ancient site.

==Case study: the necessity of vigilance in preservation of heritage==
Often unmarked on maps and undistinguished by archaeological features, holy wells are a uniquely vulnerable category of ancient site. They continue to be lost to [[farming]], drainage work, development or neglect. A recent instance is the [[desecration]] of St Bridget's Well at Rosepark, Balrothery (County [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]), destroyed by building work in 2003 despite being a protected monument.&lt;ref&gt;Skyvova, P. ''Fingallian Holy Wells''. Swords, Dublin: Fingal County Libraries, 2005, pp. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; and the destruction of a well at [[Rath Lugh]] during the construction of the [[N3 road (Ireland)|M3 Motorway]] in the [[Gabhra|Tara-Skryne Valley]], Ireland.

In [[aesthetics]], the '''human figure''' or '''human form''' in art, sculpture and other art forms involves a study and appreciation of the [[beauty]] of the [[human]] body in its depiction or presentation. The study involves an appreciation of the [[Human body shape|body shape]], including [[Human positions|body postures]] - sitting, standing or even sleeping, and movements - [[Human gait|walking]], running, [[dancing]] etc. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]  refers to the human figure as the ideal of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aesthetics-online.org/ideas/leddy.html Section 17, Immanuel Kant]&lt;/ref&gt; The human figure conforms very well to the law that states that [[form follows function]], which is believed to be a result of [[evolution]] over thousands of generations.

== Study ==
The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts. Very few art forms are not related to human figure such as [[music]], though it figures in [[lyrics]]. A study of the human figure includes a detailed study of the following subjects:
* [[Sculpture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/HumanForm.html Human figure in various art forms]&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to figure drawing.
* [[Figure drawing]] involves the depiction of the body in different postures or in motion or at work.
* [[Literature]] involves the description of the human figure to imply its [[sexual attraction]], physical ability and mentality.
* [[Dance]] is an [[art form]] that involves [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social]] [[Interpersonal relationship|interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting.
* [[Body language]] involves [[human position|body posture]], [[gesture]]s, [[facial expression]]s, and [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]].
* [[Fashion]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]].
* [[Ergonomics]] in passenger vehicles and seatings, this deals with [[unisex]] approach to human figure.

== Body proportions ==
{{Main|Body proportions}}
''Body proportions'' are the study of relation of [[human anatomy|human body]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://realcolorwheel.com/human.htm Human Proportions]&lt;/ref&gt; or in general, animal body, parts to each other and the whole, essential for depiction of the overall figure.

== Sculpture and figure drawing ==
[[File:Carracci, Annibale - Studio di nudo.jpg|thumb|Nude study, by [[Annibale Carracci]]]]
{{See also|Sculpture|figure drawing}}
A [[figure drawing]] is a study of the human form in its various shapes and postures. It is a study or stylized depiction of the human form, with the line and form of the human figure as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. It is a composed image of the subject in a still position. A life drawing is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live [[Model (art)|model]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63885">{{about|insufflation in religion and magic rituals|the medical practice of blowing substances into body cavities|Insufflation (medicine)}}

In religious and magical practice, '''insufflation''' and '''[[exsufflation]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Insufflation (from [[Latin]] word elements meaning "a blowing on") and exsufflation ("a blowing out") often cannot be distinguished in usage, and so are considered together in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; are ritual acts of blowing, breathing, hissing, or puffing that signify variously expulsion or renunciation of evil or of the [[devil]] (the Evil One), or infilling or blessing with good (especially, in religious use, with the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] or [[Divine grace|grace of God]]).

In historical Christian practice, such blowing appears most prominently in the [[liturgy]], and is connected almost exclusively with [[baptism]] and other ceremonies of [[Christian]] [[initiation]], achieving its greatest popularity during periods in which such ceremonies were given a prophylactic or [[exorcism|exorcistic]] significance, and were viewed as essential to the defeat of the devil or to the removal of the taint of [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Franz Josef Dölger]], Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Altertums 3 (Paderborn, 1909), chap. 7 "Die Exsufflatio" (pp. 118-130); Edmond Martène, De antiquis ecclesiae ritibus libri tres (Venice, 1763), I.1.viii-xiv ("Ritus instituendi catechumeni"); Rudolf Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebärden und Bewegungen in lateinischen und deutschen Auslegungen des 9. bis 13. Jahrhunderts (Munich, 1978), pp. 307-310; and Henry A. Kelly, The Devil at Baptism: Ritual, Theology, and Drama (Ithaca, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual blowing occurs in the liturgies of [[catechumenate]] and [[baptism]] from a very [[Early Christianity|early period]] and survives into the modern [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Maronite]], and [[Coptic Orthodox|Coptic]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;Alongside Martène and Suntrup (cited above), convenient collections of illustrative material include W. G. Henderson, ed., Manuale et Processionale ad usum insignis Ecclesiae Eboracensis, Surtees Society Publications 63 (Durham, 1875 for 1874), especially Appendix III "Ordines Baptismi" [cited below as York Manual]; Joseph Aloysius Assemanus, Codex liturgicus ecclesiae universae, I: De Catechumenis and II: De Baptismo (Rome, 1749; reprinted Paris and Leipzig, 1902); J. M. Neale, ed., The Ancient Liturgies of the Gallican Church...together with Parallel Passages from the Roman, Ambrosian, and Mozarabic Rites (London, 1855; rpt. New York, 1970); Enzo Lodi, Enchiridion euchologicum fontium liturgicorum (Rome, 1978); Johannes Quaesten, ed., Monumenta eucharistica et liturgica vetustissima, Florilegium Patristicum tam veteris quam medii aevi auctores complectens, ed. Bernhard Geyer and Johan Zellinger, fasc. 7 in 7 parts (Bonn, 1935-1937); E. C. Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, 2nd ed. (London, 1970); and Thomas M. Finn, Early Christian Baptism and the Catechumenate: Italy, North Africa, and Egypt (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic liturgy post-[[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] (the so-called ''novus ordo'' 1969) has largely done away with insufflation, except in a special rite for the consecration of [[chrism]] on [[Maundy Thursday]].&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Cross, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., rev. by F. L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone (Oxford, 1998), ''s.v.'' "insufflation," p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant liturgies typically abandoned it very early on. The [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Catholic liturgy]] retained both an insufflation of the baptismal water and (like the present-day Orthodox and Maronite rites)&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., 840. For the Maronite rite, derived from the ancient Syriac liturgy, see Mysteries of Initiation, Baptism, Confirmation, Communion according to the Maronite Antiochene Church, (Washington, DC, 1987); summarized by Bryan D. Spinks, Early and Medieval Rituals and Theologies of Baptism..., (Aldershot, Hants., 2006), 89-91.&lt;/ref&gt; an exsufflation of the candidate for baptism, right up to the 1960s:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;[THE INSUFFLATION] ''He breathes thrice upon the waters in the form of a cross, saying:'' Do You with Your mouth bless these pure waters: that besides their natural virtue of cleansing the body, they may also be effectual for purifying the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Andrew Daily Missal..., by Dom Gaspar Lefebvre (Bruges [Belgium]: Biblica, 1962), 492 [liturgy for the Easter vigil].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;THE EXSUFFLATION. ''The priest breathes three times on the child in the form of a cross, saying:'' Go out of him...you [[unclean spirit]] and give place to the Holy Spirit, the [[Paraclete]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Andrew Missal (Bruges, 1962), 1768 [ceremonies of baptism].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Insufflation vs. exsufflation==

From an early period, the act had two distinct but not always distinguishable meanings: it signified on the one hand the derisive repudiation or exorcism of the devil; and, on the other, purification and consecration by and inspiration with the Holy Spirit. The former is technically "exsufflation" ("blowing out") and the latter "insufflation" ("blowing in"), but ancient and medieval texts (followed by modern scholarship) make no consistent distinction in usage. For example, the texts use not only Latin ''insufflare'' ('blow in') and ''exsufflare'' ('blow out'), or their Greek or [[vernacular]] equivalents, but also the simplex ''sufflare'' ('blow'), ''halare'' ('breathe'), ''inspirare'', ''exspirare'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;P. Pashini, ''et al.,'' ed., Enciclopedia Cattolica (Florence, 1949-1954), ''s.v.'' "insufflazione," pp. 55-56. Compare Neale, The Ancient Liturgies of the Gallican Church..., p. 266, note m; Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, p. 256; Kelly, The Devil at Baptism, p. 235. Döger, Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, p. 130 similarly distinguishes between exsufflation and "halation"; and Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebärden, p. 307 warns that the distinction is a hard one to maintain. The Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, ''s.v. insufflation'' (accessed 14 Jan 2007) similarly says that "the distinction between insufflation and exsufflation has not always been preserved." And the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., p. 839, is content to give both inspirational ("to symbolize the influence of the Holy Spirit") and exorcistic ("the expulsion of evil spirits") meanings under the single heading of "insufflation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical is the 8th-century ''Libellus de mysterio baptismatis'' of [[Magnus of Sens]], one of a number of responses to a questionnaire about baptism circulated by [[Charlemagne]]. In discussing insufflation as a means of exorcising catechumens, Magnus combines a variety of mostly exsufflation-like functions≈

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Those who are to be baptised are insufflated by the priest of God, so that the Prince of Sinners [i.e. the devil] may be put to flight from out of them, and that entry for the Lord [[Christ]] might be prepared, and that by his insufflation they might be made worthy to receive the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Patrologia Latina, 102:982D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This double role appears as early as [[Cyril of Jerusalem]]'s 4th-century ''Mystagogic Catacheses''; as Edward Yarnold notes, "Cyril attributes both negative and positive effects [to insufflation]. … The rite of breathing on the [baptismal] candidate has the negative effect of blowing away the devil (exsufflation) and the positive effect of breathing in grace (insufflation)."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Jerusalem, by Edward J. Yarnold (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early period===

What might neutrally be called "sufflation" is found in some of the earliest liturgies dealing with the protracted process of initiation known as the "[[catechumenate]]," which saw its heyday in the 4th and 5th centuries. The earliest extant liturgical use is possibly that of the ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'' attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], from the 3rd or 4th century, and therefore contemporary with Cyril in the east:&lt;ref&gt;The date is controversial. The text is usually connected with practice in Rome and dated in its earliest form to the early 3rd century. But the surviving text is fragmentary, many portions surviving only in much later versions in several different languages. Chapter 20, the relevant chapter, is perhaps from the 4th century (see Maxwell E. Johnson, The Rites of Christian Initiation: Their Evolution and Interpretation (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999), 78-81). For the standard reconstruction of the text, see Bernard Botte, La "Tradition Apostolique," 42-45 (chapter 20). Whitaker, Documents, p. 4, reprints the translation of Gregory Dix, The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition, p. 32 (sect. xx.8). Botte renders the Coptic original of the sufflation passage as "exsufflet," though Kelly (Devil at Baptism, p. 87) points out that the significance of the gesture is uncertain. Geoffrey Cumming gives the more neutral translation "breathe on": Hippolytus: A Text for Students (Bramcote, Notts, 1976), p. 18, as reproduced more fully below.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who are to be baptized should … be gathered in one place. … And [the bishop] should lay his hands on them and exorcize all alien spirits, that they may flee out of them and ever return into them. And when he has finished exorcizing them, '''he shall breathe on their faces;''' and when he has signed their foreheads, ears, and noses, he shall raise them up.&lt;ref&gt;Cuming's translation, reprinted by Maxwell Johnson, Rites of Christian Initiation, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distribution, geographical and functional===

The practice entered the baptismal liturgy proper only as the catechumenate, rendered vestigial by the growth of routine [[infant baptism]], was absorbed into the rite of baptism. Both exsufflation and insufflation are well established by the time of [[Augustine]] and in later centuries are found widely. By the Western [[high Middle Ages]] of the 12th century, sufflation was geographically widespread, and had been applied not only to sufflating catechumens and [[wikt:baptizand|baptizands]],&lt;ref&gt;Nearly universally. E.g. (1) in Egypt: Canons of Hippolytus, Canon 19 (or §110), trans. Riedel 211, Achelis 93, Whitaker 88; Horner's translations of the Ethiopic, Arabic, and Sahidic versions may be found on pp. 152, 252, and 316. (2) In western Syria: Cyril, Procatechesis, cap. 9, ed.

H. Gifford, Catechetical Lectures, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series (N.Y., 1894), 3); and the ''[[Testamentum Domini nostri Jesu Christi]]'', ed. and trans.

Lawson, CCSL 113 (1989), 96/21 (Patrologia Latina 83:815A; trans. Whitaker, 117); the Spanish rites in general are discussed by Kelly, 234-36 and 244-52. (4) In northern Italy: see Kelly, 232-34 and 236-38; Whitaker, 143; and Cyrille Lambot, ed., North Italian Services of the Eleventh Century, [[Henry Bradshaw Society]] 67 (London, 1931 for 1928), 5, 6, 16. (5) In the Byzantine and other eastern rites: see, e.g., Lodi, 1303 (§2925) and Whitaker, 74; the eastern rites are treated extensively by Kelly, 136-200. (6) In Roman North Africa: Augustine is the most important witness; cp. also Quodvultdeus, De Symbolo III.1.3, ed. R. Braun, CCSL 60 (1976), 349 (Patrologia Latina 40:661).&lt;/ref&gt; but also to exorcism of readmitted [[heresy|heretics]]&lt;!-- (or lapsed Catholics regarded by Donatists as heretics) --&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Council of Constantinople (A.D. 381), Canon VII, ed. N. P. Tanner, Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils [based on the text of G. Alberigo, ''et al.''] (London, 1990) 1:35: "We exorcize them by breathing thrice their faces and ears." This canon is evidently a 5th-century addition: see Kelly 144, Tanner 1:22 note 8. &lt;!-- Augustines' anti-Donatist works --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to admission of adult converts to the catechumenate;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the Gelasian Sacramentary, ed.

For Western sources, see further below.&lt;/ref&gt; to consecration and/or exorcism of the [[baptismal font]] and water;&lt;ref&gt;Very commonly, e.g. in the Byzantine rite (Whitaker, 80); the (Milanese) Ambrosian Manual (Whitaker, 138, 145); other North Italian rites (Lambot, 33); the Liber Ordinum (ed. Férotin, 29; trans. Whitaker, 118); the Missale Gothicum; the Gregorian Sacramentary (''Hadrianum''); the Ordo Romanus L; and in the Sarum Missal (ed. J. Wickham Legg (Oxford: Clarendon, 1916; rpt. 1969), 129) and other English texts (see below).&lt;/ref&gt; to consecration or exorcism of [[Ash Wednesday|ashes]];&lt;ref&gt;In the Ambrosian Manual (Kelly, 228) and in Beroldus (12th century Milan; trans. in Whitaker, 149).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the consecration of the chrism or holy oil.&lt;ref&gt;In the Byzantine rite (Whitaker, 81); in the Ethiopic rite (A.

===Medieval period===

Most of these variations persist in one branch or another of the hybrid [[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum|Romano-Germanic]] rite that can be traced from 5th-century Rome through the western Middle Ages to the [[Council of Trent]], and beyond that into modern ([[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]]) Roman Catholicism. As the 'national' rites such as the [[Ambrosian Rite|Ambrosian tradition]] in [[northern Italy]] and the Spanish [[Mozarabic rite]] faded away or were absorbed into international practice, it was this hybrid Roman-Gallican standard that came to dominate western [[Christendom]], including [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[medieval England]], from the time of Charlemagne, and partly through his doing, through the high and late Middle Ages and into the modern period. Roman practice around the year 500 is reflected in a letter by a somewhat mysterious [[John the Deacon (Church of Rome)|John the Deacon]] to a correspondent named Senarius. The letter discusses the exsufflation of catechumens at length.&lt;ref&gt;John the Deacon, Epistola ad Senarium,  ed. [[A. Wilmart]], "Analecta Reginensia (Vat. Reg. Lat. 69)," Studi e testi 59 (1933), 172; trans. Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stowe Missal]], Irish in origin but largely [[Gallican Rite|Gallican]] in form, contains a prebaptismal sufflation of unclear significance.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Warren, Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church (Oxford, 1881; rpt. with introduction by Jane Stevenson, Woodbridge, Suffolk, 1987), 209; The Stowe Missal, ed. George F. Warner, Henry Bradshaw Society 32 (London, 1915), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The other Gallican rites are largely devoid of sufflation, though the so-called [[Gallican rite#Missale Gothicum|Missale Gothicum]] contains a triple exsufflation of baptismal water,&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 97; or L. C. Mohlberg, ed., Missale Gothicum, Rerum Ecclesiasticarum Documenta, Series Maior, Fontes 5 (Rome, 1961), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and a prebaptismal insufflation of catechumens is found in the hybrid [[Celtic Rite#The Bobbio Missal|Bobbio Missal]]&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 266&lt;/ref&gt; and the 10th-century [[Fulda]] [[sacramentary]], alongside the more common baptismal exsufflation.&lt;ref&gt;Fulda Sacramentary, 332 (§2631) and 343 (§2679-80).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th-century North-Italian baptismal ritual in the [[Ambrosian Library]] MS. T.27.Sup. makes heavy use of the practice, requiring both insufflation and triple exsufflation of the baptismal candidates ''in modum crucis'', and insufflation of the font as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lambot, North Italian Services, 5, 11, 16, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Hadrianum" version of the Gregorian Sacramentary, sent to Charlemagne from Rome and augmented probably by [[Benedict of Aniane]], contains an insufflation of the baptismal font,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Deshusses, Le Sacramentaire Grégorien, vol. 1, Spicilegium Friburgense 16 (Fribourg, 1971), 188; the rubric here is reconstructed by Deshusses from a wide variety of variants. On the attribution of the Hadrianum supplement to Benedict, see Deshusses, 1:63-7 and vol. 3, Spicilegium Friburgense 28 (Fribourg, 1982), 66-75, as well as his earlier article "Le 'Supplément' au sacramentaire grégorien: Alcuin ou S. Benoît d'Aniane?" Archiv für Liturgiewissenschaft 9.1 (1965): 48-71.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the mid-10th-century ''Ordo Romanus L'',&lt;ref&gt;Ordo L, xxxix.50; Michel Andrieu, ed., Les Ordines Romani du Haut Moyen Age, vol. 5, Spicilegium Sacrum Lovaniense, Études et Documents, fasc. 29 (Louvain, 1961), 281.&lt;/ref&gt; the basis of the later Roman pontifical. ''Ordo Romanus L'' also contains a triple exsufflation of the candidates for baptism, immediately preceding the baptism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ordo L, xx.5; Andrieu, 5:131. This section was probably also originally found in Ordo XI according to Andrieu (2:376).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the numerous [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] expositions of baptism treat sufflation to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean-Paul Bouhot, "Explications du rituel baptismal à l'époque carolingienne," Revue des études augustiniennes 24 (1978): 278-301; and Susan A. Keefe, "Carolingian Baptismal Expositions: A Handlist of Tracts and MSS," in Carolingian Essays, ed. Uta-Renate Blumenthal (Washington, DC, 1983), 169-238.&lt;/ref&gt; One anonymous 9th-century catechism is unusual in distinguishing explicitly between the exsufflation of catechumens and the insufflation of baptismal water,&lt;ref&gt;[[André Wilmart]], "Une catéchèse baptismale du IX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle," Revue Bénédictine 57 (1947): 199 (Keefe, "Expositions," text 50).&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the [[tract (literature)|tract]]s and [[florilegium|florilegia]], when they treat both, do so without referring one to the other; most confine themselves to exsufflation and are usually content to quote extracts from authorities, especially [[Isidore]] and [[Alcuin]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in Keefe's texts 34/6 and 3: Jean-Paul Bouhot, "Alcuin et le 'De Catechizandis Rudibus,'" Recherches Augustiniennes 15 (1980): 224; and Wilmart, Analecta, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly popular was Isidore's lapidary remark in the Etymologies to the effect that it is not the human being ("God's creature") that is exsufflated, but the Prince of Sinners to whom that person is subjected by being born in sin,&lt;ref&gt;''Sciendum est quod non creatura Dei in infantibus exorcizatur aut exufflatur, sed ille sub quo sunt omnes qui cum peccato nascuntur; est enim princeps peccatorum''. Etymologiarum,VI.xix.56; ed. W. M. Lindsay (Oxford, 1911).&lt;/ref&gt; a remark that echoed [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s arguments against the [[Pelagians]] to the effect that it was not the human infant (God's image) that was attacked in sufflation, but the infant's possessor, the devil. Particularly influential was Alcuin's brief treatment of the subject, the so-called ''Primo paganus'', which in turn depended heavily on John the Deacon.&lt;ref&gt;Alcuin's comments are contained in two genuine letters (numbers 134, to Odwin, and 137, to monks in the south of France), ed. Ernst Dümmler, Epistolae Karolini Aevi, 2, MGH Epistolae 4 (Berlin, 1895), 202 and 214; and in a third letter of dubious authenticity, ostensibly to Charlemagne, ed. Patrologia Latina 98:938B. The three letters are nearly verbatim identical in their description of exsufflation: ''Primo paganus catechumenus fit, accedens ad baptismum; ut renuntiet maligno spiritui et omnibus eius pompis. Exsufflatur etiam; ut, fugato diabolo, Christo Deo nostro paretur introitus'' (MGH, 214, = Keefe text 9, Bouhot, 280-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Primo paganus'' formed the basis of Charlemagne's famous circular questionnaire on baptism, part of his effort to harmonize liturgical practice across his empire; and many of the seventeen extant direct or indirect responses to the questionnaire echo Alcuin, making the process a little circular and the texts a little repetitious.&lt;ref&gt;For the various replies, see Wilmart, 154; Bouhot, 286-93; and Keefe, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of Alcuin's remarks, in fact, appears above in the quotation from the ''Libellus'' of Magnus of Sens, one of the respondents.&lt;ref&gt;The Libellus of Magnus of Sens is Keefe's text 15 (Bouhot, 287).&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire assumed that exsufflation of or on the part of the candidate for baptism was generally practiced — it merely asks what meaning is attached to the practice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Concerning the renunciation of Satan and all his works and pomps, what is the renunciation? and what are the works of the devil and his pomps? why is he breathed upon? (''cur exsufflatur?'') why is he exorcised?"&lt;ref&gt;See J. D. C. Fisher, Christian Initiation: Baptism in the Medieval West (London, 1965), 59. The text (Keefe's text 14; Bouhot, 286) is readily available in Dorothy Bethurum's edition of the Homilies of Wulfstan (Oxford, 1957), 302-3, and less readily in Jean Michel Hanssens, Amalarii...opera 1, Studi e test 138 (1948), 235-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the respondents answered that it was so that, with the devil sent fleeing, the entry of the Holy Spirit might be prepared for.

====In England====

On the other side of the Channel, in Anglo-Saxon England, sufflation is mentioned in Bishop [[Wulfstan (died 1023)|Wulfstan]]'s collection of Carolingian baptismal expositions, the ''Incipit de baptisma'', and in the two vernacular ([[Old English]]) [[homily|homilies]] based on it, the ''Quando volueris'' and the ''Sermo de baptismate''. The ''Incipit de baptisma'' reads: "On his face let the sign of the cross be made by exsufflation, so that, the devil having been put to flight, entry for our Lord Christ might be prepared."&lt;ref&gt;''In cuius … facie a sacerdote per exsufflationem signum crucis sit, ut effugeto diabolo, Cristo Domino nostro preparetur introitus''. Wulfstan, Homilies, ed. Bethurum, Homily VIIIa (p. 169, ll. 8-10). For the relationship between the three pieces, see pp. 302-4. For the parallel passages in the vernacular homilies, see Homily VIIIb (p. 172, ll. 14-22) and Homily VIIIc (pp. 176-7, ll. 29-35). Wulfstan's collection draws on a variety of Carolingian sources, but in this passage quotes almost verbatim the De Ordine Baptismi of Theodulf of Orleans (yet another Alcuin-derivative reply to Charlemagne; Keefe text 16), ed. in Patrologia Latina 105:225B.&lt;/ref&gt; Among English liturgical texts proper, the 10th-century Leofric Pontifical (and Sacramentary) dictates an insufflation of baptizands, a triple insufflation of the baptismal water, and an 'exhalation' of holy oil.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Warren, ed., The Leofric Missal as used in the Cathedral of Exeter during the Episcopate of its First Bishop, A. D. 1050-1072 (Oxford, 1883), 236-37, 259. This text may, however, originate on the Continent: see H. M. J. Bantin, Two Anglo-Saxon Pontificals, Henry Bradshaw Society 104 (London, 1989), xxiii-xxv. The contemporary, and genuinely English, Egbert Pontifical, from York, lacks mention of sufflation.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, the ''Salisbury Pontifical'' (BL [[Cotton MS Tiberius]] C.1) and the ''Pontifical'' of [[Thomas of Canterbury]] require insufflation of the font; the ''Missal'' of [[Robert of Jumièges]] (Canterbury) has an erased [[rubric]] where it may have done likewise, as well as having an illegible rubric where it probably directed the exsufflation of catechumens, and retaining the old ''ordo ad caticuminum ex pagano faciendum,'' complete with its sufflation ceremony; and an English ''Ordo Romanus'' (BL Cotton MS Vitellius E.12) contains a triple exsufflation of baptizands.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Henderson, ed., York Manual, 144, 136, 133, 142; H. A. Wilson, ed., The Missal of Robert of Jumiège, Henry Bradshaw Society 11 (London, 1896), 93, 98, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Various 12th-century texts include signing and triple exsufflation of the holy oil (Sarum), triple exsufflation of baptizands (the Ely, Magdalene, and Winton Pontificals), and insufflation of the font ''in modum crucis'' (Ely and Magdalene, followed by most later texts).&lt;ref&gt;See the Bainbridge Pontifical, appendix 3, 254; York Manual, 147, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Such are the origins of the late medieval sufflation rites, which were in turn retained in regularized form in post-Tridentine Catholicism.

===Sufflation in Protestantism===

Sufflation did not last long in any of the churches arising from the magisterial or radical reformations. [[Martin Luther]]'s first attempt at a baptismal liturgy, the Tauffbuchlin (Taufbüchlein) of 1523 (reprinted 1524 and 1525) did retain many ceremonies from the late Medieval ritual as it was known in Germany, including a triple exsufflation of baptizands. But in an epilogue, Luther listed this ceremony among the [[adiaphora]] — i.e., the inessential features that added nothing to the meaning of the sacrament:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The least importance attaches to these external things, namely '''breathing under the eyes,''' signing with the cross, placing salt in the mouth, putting spittle and clay on the ears and nose, anointing with oil the breast and shoulders, and signing the top of the head with chrism, vesting in the christening robe, and giving a burning candle into the hand, and whatever else … men have added to embellish baptism. For … they are not the kind of devices that the devil shuns."&lt;ref&gt;Luther's Works 53:103, Weimar Ausgabe 12:48; cited in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lutheran Strasbourg ''Taufbüchlein'' of June 1524, composed by [[Diobald Schwartz]], assistant to Cathedral preacher [[Martin Zell]], on the basis of the medieval rite used in Strasbourg combined with elements of Luther's 1523 rite, also retains baptismal exsufflation;&lt;ref&gt;Text in F. Hubert, Die Strassburger liturgischen Ordnungen in Zeitalter der Reformation (Göttingen: Vandenhoek und Ruprecht, 1900), 25ff.; transl. in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt; so does [[Andreas Osiander]] in Nuremberg, in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Christian Initiation, 18. The dependence of Schwartz and Osiander on Luther appears from their use of his distinctive rubric "breathe ''under the eyes''" — not found in the medieval rites.&lt;/ref&gt;

But thereafter the practice vanished from [[Lutheranism]], and indeed from Protestantism generally. Luther's revised edition of 1526 and its successors omit exsufflation altogether, as do the Luther-influenced early reformed rites of England ([[Thomas Cranmer]]'s Prayer Book of 1549) and Sweden (the Manual of [[Olavus Petri]]), despite the former's conservative basis in the medieval Sarum ritual and the latter's strong interest in exorcism as an essential part of the baptismal ritual.&lt;ref&gt;For a handy comparison, see The Manual of Olavus Petri, 1529, ed. Eric E. Yelverton (London: SPCK, 1953), p. [110].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly in the Swiss Reformation (the Zwinglian/Reformed tradition), only the very earliest rites retain sufflation, namely the ceremony published by Leo Jud, pastor of St. Peter's in Zurich, in the same year (1523) as Luther's first baptismal manual.&lt;ref&gt;English translation in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 126ff.; discussed briefly in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 31, and fully in H. O. Old, The Shaping of the Reformed Baptismal Rite in the Sixteenth Century (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufflation in Protestant-Roman Catholic debate===

Though sufflation does not appear in Protestant practice, it definitely appears in Protestant [[polemic]], where it is usually treated as an un-Scriptural and superstitious (i.e., in the Protestant view, a typically Roman Catholic) practice, and even one reeking of enchantment or witchcraft. It appears as such, for example in the work of [[Henry More]] (the 'Cambridge Platonist') on evil. His argument essentially reverses that of Augustine. Augustine had said to the Pelagians (to paraphrase): "you see that we exorcize and exsufflate infants before baptising them; therefore they must be tainted with sin and possessed by the devil since birth." More replies, in effect, "Infants cannot be devil-possessed sinners; therefore, ceremonial exorcism and exsufflation is presumptuous, frightening, and ridiculous," in a word "the most gross and fundamental Superstitions, that look like Magick or Sorcery":
   
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The conjuring the Devil also out of the Infant that is to be baptized would seem a frightful thing to the Infant himself, if he understood in what an ill plight the Priest supposes him, while he makes three Exsufflations upon his face, and uses an Exorcistical form for the ejecting of the foul Fiend. … And it is much if something might not appear affrightful to the Women in this approaching darkness. For though it be a gay thing for the Priest to be thought to have so much power over the [[Styx|Stygian]] Fiend, as to Exorcize him out of the Infant; yet it may be a sad consideration with some melancholick women laden with Superstition, to think they are never brought to bed, but they are delivered of a Devil and Child at once."&lt;ref&gt;Henry More, A Modest Enquiry into the Mystery of Iniquity (London, 1664), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sufflation appears in Roman Catholic anti-Protestant polemic, as well. The relative antiquity of the practice, and its strong endorsement by the Protestants' favorite [[Church Father|Father]], Augustine, made it a natural element in Catholic arguments that contrasted the Protestant with the ancient and Apostolic church. A true church, according to Roman Catholic apologists, would be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A Church that held the exorcismes exsufflations and renunciations, which are made in baptisme, for sacred Ceremonies, and of Apostolicall tradition.... A Church which in the Ceremonies of baptisme, vsed oyle, salte, waxe, lights, exorcismes, the signe of the Cross, the word Epheta and other thinges that accompanie it; to testifie ... by exorcismes, that baptisme puts vs out of the Diuells possession.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Davy Du Perron, The reply of the most illustrious Cardinall of Perron, to the ansvveare of the most excellent King of Great Britaine (Douay. 1630) 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was argued on the grounds that some of these ceremonies were demonstrably ancient, and all of them might be.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sundry Ceremonies vsed in baptisme, and other Sacraments, as Exorcismes, Exsufflations, Christening, and the like mentioned by S. Augustine and by diuers other ancient Fathers ..., these being practised by the Primitiue Church (which is graunted to be the true Church) and compared to the customes of Protestants, and vs, in our Churches, will easily disclose, which of the two, they or we, do more imitate, or impugne the true Church of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Humphrey Leech]]; [[Robert Persons]], Dutifull and respective considerations vpon foure seuerall heads of proofe and triall in matters of religion  ... By a late minister &amp; preacher in England (Saint-Omer, 1609), 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To which a Protestant reply was that sufflation was not ancient ''enough'', and could not be proved to be apostolic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was plain then there was no clear Tradition  in the Question, possibly there might be a custome in some Churches postnate to the times of the Apostles, but nothing that was obligatory, no Tradition Apostolicall. But this was a suppletory device ready at hand when ever they needed it; and  S. Austin confuted the Pelagians, in the Question of Original sinne, by the custome of exorcisme and insufflation, which S. Austin said came from the Apostles by Tradition, which yet was then, and is now so impossible to be prov'd, that he that shall affirm it, shall gaine only the reputation of a bold man and a confident."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Taylor, Treatises of 1. The liberty of prophesying, 2. Prayer ex tempore, 3. Episcopacie : together with a sermon preached at Oxon.... (London, 1648), 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sufflation was judged by Protestant critics to be irrational, mysterious, and obscure, an increasingly important factor by the close of the 17th century and the dawn of [[the Enlightenment]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mystery prevail'd very little in the first Hundred or Century of Years after Christ; but in the second and third, it began to establish it self by Ceremonies. To Baptism were then added the tasting of Milk and  Honey,  Anointing, the Sign of the Cross, a white Garment, &amp;amp;c. ... But in later times there was no end of Lights, Exorcisms, Exsufflations, and many other Extravagancies of Jewish, or Heathen Original ... for there is nothing like these in the Writings of the Apostles, but they are all plainly contain'd in the Books of the Gentiles, and was the Substance of their Worship."&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, Christianity Not Mysterious, Or, A Treatise Shewing that there is Nothing in The Gospel Contrary to Reason, nor Above it and that no Christian Doctrine can be Properly Call'd a Mystery (London, 1696), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was said to be a human invention, imposed by the arbitrary whim of a tyrannical prelate against the primitive Gospel freedom of the church:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Some bishop] ... taking it into his head that there ought to be a trine-immersion in baptism; another the signation of the cross; another an unction with oil; another milk and honey, and imposition of hands immediately after it; another insufflation or breathing upon the person's face to exorcise the Devil... Thus, I say, that inundation of abominable corruptions, which at present overwhelms both the Greek and Romish Churches, gradually came in at this very breech which you are now zealously maintaining, namely, the Bishop's Power to decree rites and ceremonies in the Church."&lt;ref&gt;[[Micaiah Towgood]], A dissent from the Church of England fully justified, 5th ed. (London, 1779),&lt;!-- ECCO id no. CW3321486367--&gt; p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
To all of which, Roman Catholic apologists replied that insufflation was not only ancient and Apostolic, but had been practiced by Christ himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When he [Christ] had said this he breathed upon them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Ghost...." When the Pastors of our Church use the Insufflation or Breathing upon any, for the like mystical Signification, you cry aloud, Superstition, Superstition, an apish mimical action, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;James Mumford, The Catholic scripturist, or the plea of the Roman Catholics, 4th ed. (London(?), 1767),&lt;!-- ECCO doc number CW3320627310--&gt; p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Prospects===

Though liturgical sufflation is almost gone, at least from the Western churches, its revival is not inconceivable. Liturgical renewal movements always seem to look to the 'classic' catechumenate of the 4th and 5th centuries for inspiration.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Insufflation has indeed been re-introduced into the Catholic "new catechumenate." But many ceremonies dating from that or the medieval period have been re-imported even into Protestant rites during the last couple of decades.  Perhaps even more likely is a revival in the context of the growth of the [[Roman Catholicism in Africa|Roman Catholic Church in Africa]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Asia|in Asia]], where locally and culturally meaningful ceremonies have often revolutionized practice, and where the exorcistic function of baptism has taken on a new vitality. For example, a pure insufflation is apparently practiced in the [[Philippine Independent Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jagger, Christian Initiation 1552-1969... (London, 1970), 292. This is basically a Roman rite with some Anglican-like features.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spinks mentions a pre-baptismal ceremony used by the [[Christian Workers' Fellowship]] of [[Roman Catholicism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], in which the candidates are struck with a cane and their faces are breathed upon.&lt;ref&gt;Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 203, citing Francis Wickremesinghe, "An Asian Inculturation of the Baptismal Liturgy," in David R. Holeton, ed., Growing in Newness of Life (Toronto: Anglican Book Centre, 1993), 213-217.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the latter represents a revival of historical sufflation, or a wholly new ceremony derived from local custom.

==Significance and associations==

There were at least three kinds of association that particularly influenced how liturgical sufflation came to be understood: [[Biblical]] antecedents; liturgical setting; and extra-liturgical (cultural) analogs.

===Biblical antecedents===

Three Biblical passages recur repeatedly with reference to insufflation narrowly defined, all of them referring to some kind of life-giving divine breath. The first and most commonly cited is {{bibleverse||Genesis|2:7}} (echoed by {{bibleverse||Wisdom|15:11}} and {{bibleverse||Job|33:4}}), in which God first creates man and then breathes into him the breath of life, in order to give him (as the passage was later interpreted) a human soul.&lt;ref&gt;"His life is of less worth than clay, because he failed to know the one who formed him and inspired him with an active soul and breathed into him a living spirit [Vulg. 'insufflavit ei spiritum vitalem']" Wisdom 15:10-11 (RSV); "The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life" Job 33:4 (RSV). Cp. Psalm 33:6.&lt;/ref&gt; The second passage, {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|37:9}}, reinterprets the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] passage prophetically, in foreseeing God resurrecting the dead bones of exiled [[Israelites|Israel]] by means of his life-giving breath.&lt;ref&gt;"Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain [Vulg. 'insuffla super interfectos istos'], that they may live.... And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet" Ezekiel 37:9-10 (RSV).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, in {{bibleverse||John|20:22}}, Christ is represented as conveying the [[Paraclete]] to his disciples, and so initiating the commissioned church, by breathing on them, here too, very possibly, with implicit reference to the original creation.&lt;ref&gt;"He breathed [on them?] [Vulg. ''insufflavit''] and said to them, 'receive the Holy Spirit'" John 20:22 (RSV).&lt;/ref&gt; The two passages were connected explicitly in later Christian exegesis: the same breath that created man re-created him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Insufflation] signifies, To blow into, Gen. 2. 7. This sheweth mans soul not to be of the earth, as his body was, but of nothing, by the insufflation of God, and so differing from the spirit of beasts, Eccl. 3. 21. This word is used also, when Christ to make men new creatures, inspired his Apostles with the holy Ghost, Joh. 20. 21."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Wilson (lexicographer)|Thomas Wilson]], ed. John Bagwell, ''A complete Christian dictionary wherein the significations and several acceptations of all the words mentioned in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are fully opened, expressed, explained ...'' (London, 1661) p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Lord God, saith the Text, formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his Nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living Soul. His Body made of Earth, but his Soul the Breath of God. … We must not understand it grosly; for so Breath is not attributable unto God, who is a simple and perfect Spirit; but … as a figurative expression of God's communicating unto Man that inward Principle, whereby he lives and acts, not only in common with, but in a degree above other Animals. … The Learned P. Fagius takes notice of three things in the Text of Moses, which do conclude the Immortality of the Soul of Man. I. ''Insufflatio illa Dei:'' This Inspiration from God spoken of: For he that breaths into another, contributes unto him ''aliquid de suo'' somewhat of his own: And therefore, saith he, when our B. Saviour would communicate his Spirit to his Disciples, he did it with Insufflation, breathing on them, thereby to signifie, ''se Divinum &amp; de suo quiddam illis contribuere'' [i.e., that he was himself divine and was infusing something of his own into them]."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Camfield, A theological discourse of angels and their ministries wherein their existence, nature, number, order and offices are modestly treated of … . (London, 1678) 184-185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The associations with creation, rebirth, initiation, and revivification created by these passages of  Scripture suited insufflation for a role in baptism as it has been most commonly regarded: as figuring the waters of creation (over which the Spirit brooded); as figuring the womb of rebirth; and as figuring (in [[Saint Paul]]'s metaphor) the tomb, into which the Christian joins Christ in descending, and from which the Christian likewise joins Christ in ascending, dead to the old life but made alive again in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 6:3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Biblical antecedents for exsufflation, properly speaking, that is, exorcistic blowing, especially the numerous [[Old Testament]] passages in which "the breath of God" is the vehicle or symbol not of life but of death and destruction — an expression of the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]]: "by the breath of God they perish / and by the blast of his anger they are consumed" (Job 4:9, RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Isaiah 11:4 ("with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked").&lt;/ref&gt; The same power is attributed metaphorically to Christ: "The lawless one will be revealed, and the Lord [[Jesus]] will slay him with the breath of his mouth" (2 Thessalonians 2:8, RSV). Even less obvious passages could be associated with liturgical exsufflation. [[Jesse of Amiens]], for example, interprets Psalm 34 (Vulg. 35):5 as descriptive of the fate of exsufflated devils: ""Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them on!"&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 34:5 (RSV) (Vulg. 35:5); Jesse of Amiens, Patrologia Latina 105:786D.&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[apocrypha]]l [[Acts of Thomas]] describes a baptismal ceremony which, though it does not explicitly contain a breathing ceremony, may imply one, "Let the gift come by which, breathing upon thine enemies, thou didst make them draw back and fall headlong, and let it dwell in this oil, over which we name thy holy name."&lt;ref&gt;Acts of Thomas, §157; trans. in New Testament Apocrypha, ed. Edgar Hennecke; rev. by Wilhelm Schneemelcher; trans. R. McL. Wilson (Cambridge, 1992), 2:401. The Biblical allusion is apparently to John 18.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

God's breath can be fiery, consuming all it touches: "I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath" (Ezekiel 21:31, RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Vulg. "In igne furoris mei sufflabo in te." Cp. the fiery brimstone breath of God in Isaiah 30:33.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the interpretations of exsufflation may reflect this. Cyril of Jerusalem, for example, when he discusses exsufflation in his [[catechetical]] sermons, interprets the liturgical practice in terms of fire:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The breathing of the saints and the invocation of the name of God, like fiercest flame, scorch and drive out evil spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Catechesis XX.3, Patrologia Graeca 33:1079/80; trans. Gifford, 147. In the pre-catechetical lectures he seems to combine the fire of God's wrath and the Biblical motif of the refiner's fire (Malachi 3:2, 1 Peter 1:7, Revelation 3:18): "as the goldsmith..., as it were breathing on the gold which is hid in the hollow of the forge, stimulates the flame it acts upon and so obtains what he is seeking; so also exorcizers..., setting the soul on fire in the crucible of the body, make the evil spirit flee." Procatechesis §9; ed. F. L. Cross, 5-6 (Patrologia Graeca 33:347/8-349/350); trans. Cross, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fire remains a theme in later liturgical exorcisms, for devils, as [[Nicetas of Remesiana|Nicetas]] is reported to have said, "are purged by exorcisms as by fire":&lt;ref&gt;Nicetas quoted in Bouhot, De catechizandis rudibus, 225 (§67).&lt;/ref&gt; "we come against you, devil, with spiritual words and fiery speech; we ignite the hiding places in which you are concealed."&lt;ref&gt;Liber Ordinum, ed. Férotin, 75; trans. in Kelly, 248 (cp. 237-37). Cp. Lambot, North Italian Services, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical context===

More importantly, perhaps, fire is physically and symbolically associated with sufflation because of the traditional placement of baptism within the [[Paschal vigil]] — a setting heavy with symbolism of light and fire: the blessing of the Paschal candle, the lighting of the "new fire," and the singing of the ''[[Exultet]]'' and the ''[[Lumen Christi]].'' The intimate connection between divine breath and divine fire appears in its most visually arresting form during the [[benediction]] of the font, in which, according to most orders, the candle is dipped in the font while the priest declares the power of the Holy Spirit to have descended into the water: the sufflation of the font in most cases directly precedes or accompanies the immersion of the candle.&lt;ref&gt;Amalarius, Liber Officialis, I.xxv.2 (ed. Hanssens, 2:134-5) and I.xxvi (2:136-8); the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. Dumas, 99 (§704d); many manuscripts of the Hadrianum (ed. Deshusses 1:188, §374e); Ordo Romanus L xxxix.50 (ed. Andrieu 5:280-1); the Missal of Robert of Jumiège, 98-9; the York Manual, 15, 136*, 144*, 149*, 153*; Suntrup, 417-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Their close association can again be illustrated from Wulfstan's baptismal homilies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the breath that the priest breathes into the font when he blesses it, the devil is straightway driven out from it. And when the priest dips the consecrated candle in the water, then that water forthwith becomes imbued with the Holy Ghost."&lt;ref&gt;Wulfstan, Homily VIIIb (ed. Bethurum, p. 173, ll. 39-43); cp. Homily VIIIa (p. 170, ll. 36-40) and Homily VIIIc (p. 179, ll. 73-6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar considerations bind sufflation closely to imagery of light and darkness, specifically of the movement of the baptizand from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light (a very common theme), and to the sign of the cross (a very common action), among others that could be mentioned. John the Deacon uses light-dark imagery to explain exsufflation in exorcism as a transition:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;The exsufflated person is exorcised so that ... having been delivered from the power of darkness, he might be translated into the kingdom ... of God.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmart, 172; thence also in many of the Carolingian expositions, e.g. in Keefe's tet 32, ed. Friedrich Stegmüller, "Bischof Angilmodus über die Taufe...," Römische Quartalschrift für Christliche Altertumskunde und Kirchengeschichte 52 (1957): 20; and text 25, the tract by Archbishop Liedrad of Lyons, Patrologia Latina 99:856D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
So also Augustine ("The church exsufflates and exorcises [infants] that the power of darkness might be cast out from them"&lt;ref&gt;Contra Julianum (opus imperf.) 1.50, ed. Michaela Zelzer, [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 85/1 (Vienna, 1974), 43 (Patrologia Latina 45:1073) Cp. 3.182, CSEL 85/1, 482 (PL 45:1323); the Contra Julianum 1.4.14 (PL 44:649), 1.5.19 (PL 44:653), 3.3.8 (PL 44:705), 3.5.11 (PL 44:707-8), and 6.5.11 (PL 44:828-9); and the Ennarationes in Psalmos 76.4, ed. E. Dekkers and J. Fraipont, CCSL 39 (1956), 1055.&lt;/ref&gt;), and Isidore ("The power of the devil is ... exsufflated in them, so that ... being delivered from the power of darkness, [they] might be translated unto the kingdom of their Lord"&lt;ref&gt;De ecclesiastics officiis, II.xxi.3, ed. C. M. Lawson,  CCSL 113 (1989), 96/20-24 (PL 83:815A), and thence into various Carolingian texts, e.g. the Pseudo-Maxentius Collectanea (= Keefe text 37), PL 106:54C.&lt;/ref&gt;).

And as regards signation (the sign of the cross), in Western texts from as early as the [[Gelasian Sacramentary]], the one gesture almost always precedes (or precedes and follows) the other,&lt;ref&gt;Mohlberg, Sacramentarium Gelasianum 93 (§598) ("exsufflas in faciem eius et facis ei crucem in fronte"); the same doublet is applied to the baptismal water in the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. A. Dumas, Liber Sacramentorum Gellonensis, CCSL 159 (1981), 335 (§2317-18) and 346 (§2379), and in the North Italian rituals, ed. Lambot, 33. Signing precedes and follows in the Missale Gothicum, ed. Neale, 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and their significance is often complementary if not identical. In [[Raban Maur]]'s discussion of the baptismal liturgy, for example, the exsufflation is said to expel the devil, the signing to keep him from coming back.&lt;ref&gt;Alois Knöpfler, ed., Rabani Mauri de institutione clericorum, Veröffentlichungen aus dem kirchen-historischen Seminar München 5 (Munich, 1900), I.xxvii, p. 48 (PL 107:311D-12A).&lt;/ref&gt; The two signs are frequently combined, the blowing done in the form of a cross, e.g. in the [[Syriac Chritianity|Syriac Rite]] described by [[James of Edessa]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Documents, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; in the modern Coptic rite,&lt;ref&gt;Lodi, 1557&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 9th-century ''Ordo Romanus XXXI'',&lt;ref&gt;Andrieu, 3:502, §80 ("Anhelet in modum cruce").&lt;/ref&gt; in Wulfstan's Anglo-Saxon homilies and their [[Continental Europe|Continental]] sources,&lt;ref&gt;Wulfstan, Homilies (ed. Bethurum), Homily VIIIa, p. 16; Theodulf of Orleans, De ordine baptismi, PL 105:225B.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 10th-century Ambrosian rites for catechumen and font,&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, 143, 145&lt;/ref&gt; in the 11th-century North Italian catechumenal rites,&lt;ref&gt;Lambot, 5, 6, 11, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 12th- through 15th-century English pontificals,&lt;ref&gt;York Manual, 144* (11th century), 149* (12th century), 150* (13th century), and 153* (15th century).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Sarum Missal]],&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Legg, ed., [[Sarum Missal]], 129.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 13th-century Roman pontifical.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Andrieu, Le Pontifical Romain au Moyen Age (Vatican City, 1940), 2:514.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extra-liturgical (hagiographic and magical) use==

===Patristic period===

There are hints in some of the Church Fathers that Christians had a habit of breathing (or hissing) at evil spirits as a recognized act of revulsion or repulsion, even apart from the ceremonies of the church. [[Tertullian]] is perhaps the best witness. He seems to be talking about an extra-liturgical casting out of demons by means of exsufflation and signing when he declares that gods rejected by Christians are driven from the bodies of men "by our touch and by our breath," and are thus "carried away by the thought and vision of the fire [of judgment]."&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Apologeticus, 23.15-16, ed. Henricus Hoppe, CSEL 69 (1939), 67; trans. by [[A. Souter]], Apology (Cambridge, 1917), 82/83. Cp. De Anima, 1.5, ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 782.&lt;/ref&gt; He is talking about an ordinary gesture of aversion when he asks a Christian incense-dealer (regarded as hypocritical because he sells incense for [[polytheism|polytheistic]] altars), "with what mouth, I ask, will he spit and blow before the fuming altars for which he himself provided? with what constancy will he [thus] exorcise his foster children?"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, De idolatria XI.7, ed. and tr. [[J. H. Waszink]] and J. C. M. Van Winden, Vigiliae Christianae Supplements 1 (Leiden, 1987), 42-5 (commentary, 210); also ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 111; trans. S. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, 3:68.&lt;/ref&gt; And his remarks to his wife about the dangers of mixed marriage suggest that exsufflation was a distinctively Christian practice:{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--see talk--&gt; "[If you marry again, to a non-Christian,] shall you escape notice when you sign your bed or your body? when you blow away some impurity? When even by night you rise to pray?"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Ad uxorem suam II.v.3, ed. and trans. Claude Munier, Tertullien: "A son Epouse," Sources Chrétiennes 273 (Paris, 1980), 138 (CCSL 1 (1954), 389; PL 1:1296); trans. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers 4:46.&lt;/ref&gt;

If such a custom did exist, it would clarify certain remarks by other Fathers, which might otherwise seem merely metaphorical. [[Eusebius]], for example, says of the saints that they were men "who though they only breathed and spoke, were able to scatter the counsels of evil demons."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' VII.x.4, ed. Eduard Schwartz, Eusebius Werke 2.2, Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte, 9 (Leipzig, 1908), 650 (Patrologia Graeca 20:659/60); trans. Arthur C. McGiffert, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 1:298.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] describes the right response to [[Gnostic]] doctrine as "reviling" (καταφυσησαντας; literally ''exsufflantes'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.16.3, ed. A. Rousseau and Louis Doutreleau, Contre les Hérésies 1, Sources Chrétiennes 263 (Paris, 1978), 262-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], speaking of resisting temptation, not of baptism, says that "the mere breathing of the exorcist becomes as a fire to that unseen foe."&lt;ref&gt;Catechesis 16.19, Patrologia Graeca 33:945/6A-B; trans. Gifford, Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 7:120.&lt;/ref&gt; And Augustine's remarks about blowing on [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|images of the emperor]] suggest that the significance of the gesture was well enough established to be actionable: "Of the great crime of [[Law of majestas|lese majesty]] ... is he held guilty, according to the laws of this world, who blows upon an image ... of the emperor."&lt;ref&gt;Contra Julianum, opus imperf. 3.199, CSEL 85/1:498 (PL 45:1333).&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as [[Bede]], we may suspect that "exsufflate" in the sense of "revile" or "cast off" may be a living metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Historia ecclesiastica, in Charles Plummer, ed., Baedae opera historica (Oxford, 1896), 1:2231 and 1:7; cp. 2:226n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiography==

The extremely influential ''Life of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]]'' by [[Sulpicius Severus]] seems to have set in motion a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] tradition in which saints cast out demons or repel tempting devils by blowing at them.&lt;ref&gt;Vita Sancti Martini, ed. Carl Halm, CSEL 1.206-7 (cp. the Old English version in [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]], Lives of the Saints, ed. W. W. Skeat, EETS 76 (1890), 292-3 (II.xxxi.42)).&lt;/ref&gt; Of Saint [[Pachomius]], for example, it is said that "defending his brow with the sign of the cross, he blew upon [the demon] and immediately he fled … ; blowing upon him, he said, 'depart from me, devil.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in a note to Benedict of Aniane's Concordia regularum, PL 103:1020C-D.&lt;/ref&gt; And of [[Saint Goswin]] that "a demon stood before Saint Goswin saying 'surely you see that I am Christ …' and … therefore Saint Goswin exsufflated vigorously, saying 'depart foe …,' and immediately … the devil vanished."&lt;ref&gt;Anecdota ex codicibus hagiographicis Iohannis Gielemans canonici regularis in rubea valle prope Bruxelles, ed. Hagiographi Bollandiani (Brussels, 1895), 23 (Sanctilogium 9.2).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprian and Justina|Saint Justina]] is reported to have similarly unmasked a series of increasingly subtle and powerful demons, finally melting the prince of demons himself: "blowing upon the devil, she immediately melted him like wax and … felt herself freed from all temptation."&lt;ref&gt;Th. Graese, ed., Jacobi Voragine Legenda Aurea …, 3rd ed. (Vratislaviae, 1890), cap. cxlii (p. 634; cp. 633).&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Saint Felix]] is said to have destroyed [[Cult image|idols]] and uprooted [[sacred tree]]s by like means.&lt;ref&gt;Graesse, ed., Legenda Aurea, cap. cxxvi (p.575) and cap. xix (102-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

The breath of the saints was credited with healing, as well as exorcistic, powers from an early period. [[Gregory of Nyssa]] says of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]] ('Gregory the magician') that he needed to resort to "no finicking  and laborious" magic, but "there sufficed, for both the casting out of demons and the healing of bodily ailments, the breath of his mouth."&lt;ref&gt;PG 46:943/4A.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar powers are attributed to the Irish saints: kindling lamps, curing dumbness.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Plummer, ed., Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae (Oxford, 1910), 1:clxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme, too, persists in later hagiographic and quasi-hagiographic texts, appearing, for example in the ''Estoire del saint graal'' as the agency by which a madman is miraculously restored. Among English texts, Felix's ''Life of [[Saint Guthlac]]'' relates that in order to give relief to a boy afflicted by madness, he "washed him in the water of the sacred font and, breathing into his face the breath of healing [or 'spirit of salvation'], drove away from him all the power of the evil spirit,"&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Colgrave, ed. and trans., Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac (Cambridge, 1956), 130/31.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing healing from exorcism in an era in which madness was attributed to demonic possession. The miracle that Bishop John performed, according to [[Bede]], on behalf of [[Herebald]], is another example, since it involved a sufflation that was seemingly exorcistic, catechetical, and curative simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, Historia ecclesiastica 5.6 (Plummer, 291; see also B. Colgrave and R. A. B. Myonrs, Bede's Ecclesastical History (Oxford, 1969), 468 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magic and folk medicine==

[[Tertullian]] remarked to his wife about Christian practices: "will you not seem to be doing magic?" in the eyes of a non-believer.&lt;ref&gt;Ad uxorem II.v.3 (ed. Munier, 138). For additional references to blowing in ancient magic, see Waszink's and Van Winden's notes to Tertullian's De idolatria, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celsus]] (according to [[Origen]]) reports the use of exsufflation by Egyptian magicians.&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' 1.68, ed. Marcel Borret, Origène: "Contre Celse," 1, Sources Chrétiennes 132 (Paris, 1967), 266 (PG 11:787/788A).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]] seems to attack its use by Roman ones.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus, Enneads, II.ix.14, ed. and trans. [[A. H. Armstrong]], Loeb Classical Library, vol. 2 (Cambridge, Mass., 1966), pp. 278/9.&lt;/ref&gt; One of [[Lucian]]'s tall tales mentions a Chaldean pest-control sorcerer who causes toads and snakes to vanish by blowing on them.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Macleod, ed., Luciani opera, vol. 2 (Oxford, 1974), 182; trans. in "The Liar," The Works of Lucian of Samosata, trans. H. W. and F. G. Fowler, vol. 3 (Oxford, 1905), 236.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is possible to see Jesus himself as a supernatural healer (Christ Jesus the son of God), in many popular events of [[the holy Bible]], in which he is constantly healing many blind, lame, crippled, lepers, maimed, and even causing his own resurrection, just to name a few. In one instance Jesus used his spit to heal the eyes of a blind man who was born blind, caused by his parents sins;&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of John, KJV text, John 9:1-9:11.&lt;/ref&gt;
. However, regarding magic, in Syria, where ceremonial breathing became formalized as part of the rite of visitation of the sick. [[Ephraem Syrus]] advises that "if medicine fails you when you are sick, the 'visitors' will help, will pray for health, and one of them will breathe in your mouth, the other will sign you [with the sign of the cross]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Döger, Exorzismus, 125n.&lt;/ref&gt;

If it was either originally Christian (citation needed), Catholic or from the pagan practices, almost similar methods of healing have been reported, continuing until modern times: in Westphalia, the healing of a wound by triple signing and triple cruciform sufflation, or by exsufflation accompanied by a rhyming charm; and in Holland the alleviation of toothache by similar means.&lt;ref&gt;Dölger, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Drechsler, "Illnesses were blown away by the breath. If a child had bumped himself, one would blow three times on the place and it would 'fly away.'"&lt;ref&gt;Paul Drechsler, Sitte, Brauch, und Volksglaube im Schlesien, vol. 2 (Leipzig, 1906), 280. Cp. 298 and chapter 14, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; Burns, and conditions that in some fashion resemble burns, such as fevers, boils, sore throats and rashes, are naturally the most common objects of blowing among modern folk-remedies,&lt;ref&gt;See HddA, i, ''s.v.'' "Blasen," cols. 1357-58. See also from the Puckett collections nos. 6943, 8329, and 8401 (alleviation of a burn); 2750, 2889, 2890, 10566, and 2898 (thrush and sore mouth); and 9277 and 9279 (erysipelas): Popular Beliefs and Superstitions: A Compendium of American Folklore from the...Collection of Newbell Niles Puckett, ed. Wayland D. Hand, Anna Casetta, and Sondra B. Thiederman, 3 vols. (Boston, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; for example the Shetland cure that requires blowing on a burn three times while reciting the charm "Here come I to cure a burnt sore. / If the dead knew what the living endure, / The burnt sore would burn no more."&lt;ref&gt;[[T. F. Thiselton-Dyer]], ''English Folklore'', 2nd rev. ed. (London, 1880), 170.&lt;/ref&gt; But everything from jaundice, convulsions, and colic to bad luck and evil spells can apparently be alleviated by a bit of blowing.&lt;ref&gt;HddA, ''loc. cit.''; cp. also the Puckett collection, nos. 23714, 23956, 23957, 9215, 25571, 19545, 9563, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolters points out that exorcistic blowing was still (in 1935) found in the custom of blowing over bread that is about to be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Wolters cites Drechsler 2:15, a passage that describes how to avert the bad luck of biting into a piece of bread already bitten.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Syrian blows over his child to avert the evil eye. Some still&lt;br/&gt;blow three times over a strange spoon before using it, and in Alaska the medicine&lt;br/&gt;man blows into the nose and mouth of a patient to drive out the daemon of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier F. M. G. Wolters, Notes on Antique Folklore on the basis of Pliny's "Natural History" Bk. XXVIII.22-29 (Amsterdam, 1935), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
Finally, in one American example of superstition clearly derived from liturgical use, it is said that if at the baptism of a baby one turns at the door and blows three times, one can successfully prevent the devil from ever coming between the baby and the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Puckett Collection, no. 3294 (reported from Cleveland, Ohio, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''interior portrait''' ('''portrait d'intérieur''') or, in German, '''Zimmerbild''' (room picture), is a pictorial genre that appeared in Europe near the end of the 17th century and enjoyed a great vogue in the second half of the 19th century. It involves a careful, detailed representation of a living space, without any people. These paintings were generally rendered as [[watercolor]]s and required great technical mastery, if little creativity. By the mid-20th century, although such scenes were still being created, photography had changed this style of painting into a form of intentional archaism.

==Birth of the genre==
The interior portrait should not be confused with what is called a "[[conversation piece]]" in England; a term which designates a scene with a group of people engaged in some activity and often placed outdoors. The true interior piece shows only the room and decor, although previous activity may be suggested by the placement of articles in the room.

This type of scene first appears near the end of the 17th century. At that time, the intent was entirely descriptive. They were usually done specifically to show the contents of an art gallery, personal library or [[cabinet of curiosities]]. One of the first known examples depicts the library of [[Samuel Pepys]] in London, dating from 1693. They are still valued today by researchers and decorators. In the case of Pepys, it can be seen, firsthand, how a scholar of that time arranges his books in a bookcase (an innovation at that time), uses a lectern, places cushions for his comfort, hangs maps, etc. 
[[File:Boxbarth after Feuillet Library interior c1700.jpg|thumb|left|Library project, c.1700. Engraving by Johann Boxbarth (fl.1690–1710)]]
It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that a new type of interior portrait with a different intent made its appearance. This type first arose in architectural firms and was done for the benefit of their clients. Great architects such as the [[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and his brother [[Robert Adam]] of Scotland and [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] would execute watercolors of their previous projects to entice prospective customers. This created a fad among the wealthy and the nobility to commission paintings of their own rooms, to show off and preserve for posterity. These paintings were often compiled into albums. This craze was particularly prevalent in England. From there, it spread widely throughout Europe.

==Apogee in the 19th century==
[[File:Zimmerbild 83.jpg|thumb|The psychological dimensions of décor: interior portrait by Leopold Zielcke (1791–1861). Berlin, 1825]]

The first historically important example of the interior portrait represents a small art gallery set up by the [[Empress Josephine]] at [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]] in 1812. In this watercolor by [[Auguste-Siméon Garneray]], we can see her harp, art collection and her shawl, left on an armchair. Thus a new element appears: the psychological elements of the décor and a palpable human presence. One can feel the owner's emotions and thoughts. In this sense, the paintings have truly become "portraits".&lt;ref&gt;''An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration, From Pompeii to Art Nouveau'' by [[Mario Praz]], Thames &amp; Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-23358-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Premazzi parlour.jpg|thumb|225px|The "petit salon rouge" at the [[Alexander Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], by [[Luigi Premazzi]] (c.1855)]]

The immense popularity of these paintings in the 19th century can be explained by many factors. Among the [[nouveau-riche]] and the [[bourgeoisie]], great importance was given to the home as a place of comfort, intimacy and family. This period also saw a specialization (e.g. separate dining rooms) that were once known only to the very wealthy. These new "middle-classes" were also eager to copy aristocratic tastes and industrialization made a much wider variety of furniture easily affordable. Finally, decorative styles were constantly being changed and resurrected, so interior portraits were a way of preserving one's memories and bequeathing them to the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/search/House%20Proud Exhibition Archive: ''House Proud'', Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Victoria]] was very fond of these portraits as they allowed her to give the public a look at her loving family life and the comforts of home in a tasteful manner.&lt;ref&gt;''La dernière reine : Victoria, 1819-1901'' by Philippe Alexandre and Béatrix de l'Aulnoit, Robert Laffont, Paris 2000, {{ISBN|2-221-09064-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craze was thereby spread throughout the Royal Families of Europe. Due to the number of lavishly decorated palaces they possessed ([[The Winter Palace]],  [[Tsarskoye Selo]], [[Gatchina Palace]], [[Peterhof Palace]], [[Pavlovsk Palace]]...), the Tsars were among the most enthusiastic commissioners of interior portraits. Virtually all of their rooms (except the most private ones) were rendered at least once; some several times. These watercolors are considered to be among the best of their genre.&lt;ref&gt;in ''Vues des palais impériaux des environs de Saint-Petersbourg'', collected under the direction of Emmanuel Ducamp, edited by Alain de Gourcuff, Paris 1992, {{ISBN|2-909838-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speciality artists==
[[File:Ludwig Passini - The Salone of the Palazzo Barbaro.jpg|thumb|Salon of the [[Palazzo Barbaro]], [[Venice]]. [[Ludwig Passini]] (1855)]]
[[File:Zimmerbild 99.jpg|thumbnail|[[Ferdinand Rothbart]], Coburg 1848]]

At a time when every cultured young woman learned to paint watercolors, many painted their own rooms or the ones where they were given their lessons. Most of the surviving examples are anonymous and rarely of high quality, but they often have a charm that compensates for what they lack in technical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Gere, ''L'époque et son style, la décoration intérieure au XIXe siècle'', Flammarion, Paris 1989, {{ISBN|978-2-08-010971-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Thornton]], ''Authentic Decor: The Domestic Interior 1620-1920'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1986, {{ISBN|0-297-83239-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some members of the aristocracy had real talent, verging on the professional. The Polish Count [[Artur Potocki]], for example, travelled widely, painting watercolors of the hotel rooms and other places where he stayed, from Rome to London.

Nevertheless, virtually all the highest-quality works were produced by professionals with exceptional virtuosity in watercolors and a mastery of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]...especially conical perspective, with two or three [[vanishing point]]s, which produces an eerily photographic effect for modern eyes.

With only a few exceptions, such as [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]] and [[Eugène Lami]] of France, architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and furniture-maker [[Thomas Sheraton]] (both of England), few artists who dealt exclusively with these portraits are still familiar today. Among some notable artists who produced them, not previously mentioned:
* In England: [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Henry Hunt]], [[Mary Ellen Best]],  [[William Henry Pyne]]. 
* In France: [[Charles Percier]], [[Adrien Dauzats]].
* In Germany: [[Ferdinand Rothbart]], [[Rudolf von Alt]], [[Eduard Gaertner]].
* In Russia: [[Eduard Hau]], [[Vasily Sadovnikov]], [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]], [[Grigory Chernetsov]], [[Nikanor Chernetsov]] (his brother), [[Alexander Brullov]], [[Karl Brullov]] (his brother), [[Pyotr Sokolov (portraitist)|Pyotr Sokolov]], [[Orest Kiprensky]], [[Alexey Venetsianov]].
* In Poland, [[Aleksander Gryglewski]].

&lt;!--Please DO NOT add any Marian, Josephian or Jesus images on this list without properly confirming or seeing a copy of the Papal Bull authorizing their coronation either through social media, the chancery or diocese or at the Papal archives in Rome. The list is continuously being monitored and any attempt to add or remove an entry is scrutinized for authenticity and veracity of the existence of a Papal document from Rome. Just because a Bishop or priest crowns an image DOES  NOT MERIT  that a Pope has expressively authorized such a Pontifical act in a canonical manner. Just because a Pope blesses a crown or places a crown on the image out of piety does not make it canonical or institutional, for many instances has a Pontiff placed a crown out of piety but has not issued a papal document for its canonical effect in the Church.   --&gt;

[[File:Coronación Canónica de María Santísima de la Victoria 5 de mayo de 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Spaniard]] bishop José Vilaplana Blasco, as proxy in the name of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] crowning the image of Santa Maria Victoria in [[Spain]].]] 
[[File:Santissima Bula de la Virgen de Triana.jpg|thumb|The canonical document of [[Papal bull]] for Our Lady of Hope of Triana, legally granting the Marian image the Pontifical right to wear a crown in 1984 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. ]]
 
The following list enumerates the various [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]], [[Saint Joseph|Josephian]], and [[Christological]] images venerated in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], by which a [[Pope]] has officially issued a [[Papal bull]] of '''[[canonical coronation]]''' either by the [[Pontiff]], a [[Papal legate]] or a [[Papal nuncio]].
 
[[File:Papal bull for the Canonical Coronation of Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga from Pope Pius 12th.jpg|thumb|The Papal decree issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] for the [[canonical coronation]] of [[Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga]] in 1956.]]

The very first Marian image crowned without a direct papal approval was by Cardinal [[Francesco Sforza Pallavicino]] with ''La Madonna della Oropa'' on 30&amp;nbsp;August 1620. The first Marian image Pontifically crowned was the painted image of ''La Madonna della Febbre'' (Madonna of Fever) on 27 May 1631 by [[Pope Urban VIII]] through the Vatican Chapter located at the Sacristy of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].

The solemn prescription of ritual to crowning images is embedded in ''[[Ordo Coronandi Imaginem Beatae Mariae Virginis]]'' published by the [[Holy Office]] on 25 May 1981. Prior to 1989, papal bulls concerning the authorization of canonical coronations were handwritten on [[parchment]]. After 1989, the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] began issuing the specific recognition to crown a religious image, spelling out its approved devotional title and authorizing Papal legate. Several venerated  images of the [[Child Jesus]] and [[Saint Joseph]] have also been granted a Pontifical coronation.

|Notre Dame de Bon Secours ||15 August 1880 || Lablachere, [[Ardeche]]&lt;ref&gt;Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. — Dioecesis Vivariensis intra fines in
paroecia de Lablachere conspicuum exstat sanctuarium sub titulo Beatae
Mariae Virginis a Bono Succursu, quod christifideles, non modo a finitimis
locis sed a longinquis etiam regionibus peregrinorum more ad ipsum
confluentes, pie devoteque celebrant. Loco quidem antiquioris et parva®
ecclesiae, quam saeculo decimo septimo vertente, iam quidam pii coniuges
sub eodem titulo fundaverant, hodiernum templum saeculo decimo nono
tantum erectum est; ipsumque, tribus navibus constans, amplitudine molis
atque ornatu, picturis parietum, artisque operibus quibus ditatur, plane
dignum omnium laudibus videtur; adeo ut inter regionis Vivariensis sanctuaria
principem nunc locum facile teneat. Illud autem sanctuarium cuiusvis
ordinis condicionisque christifideles frequentes visitant Beatae Mariae
Virginis de Bono Succursu simulacrum veneraturi, quod ab annis fere
ducentis et quinquaginta inibi servatur et colitur, quodque prodigiis gratiisque
clarum aureo diademate anno MDCCCLXXX Apostolica auctoritate coronatum
est. Eodem in templo divinus cultus nitide peragitur a frugiferae
Congregationis Beatae Mariae Immaculatae sacerdotibus, qui sanctuario
addicti religiosam vitam in adiectis aedibus vivunt bonoque spirituali
peregrinorum prospiciunt.&lt;/ref&gt;||&lt;p align=center&gt;[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Pope_Leo_XIII.svg|100px]] &lt;p align=center&gt;Leo XIII||[[File:Vierge à l'Enfant - Notre-dame de Bon Secours.jpg|200px]]||[[File:Notredame02.jpg|200px]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2807">'''Neo-minimalism''' is an amorphous art movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It has alternatively been called "neo-geometric" or "neo-geo" art.  Other terms include: [[Neo-conceptual art|Neo-Conceptualism]], [[Neo-Futurism]], Neo-Op, Neo-Pop, New Abstraction, Poptometry, Post-Abstractionism, Simulationism, and Smart Art.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker, ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945'', Third edition, New York, G. K. Hall, 1992; p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The aspects of "postmodern art" that have been described as neo-minimalism (and related terms) involve a general "reevaluation of earlier art forms."&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Twelfth edition, Thomson / Wadsworth, 2005; Vol. 2, p. 844.&lt;/ref&gt;  As its various titles indicate, the movement draws on earlier mid-to-late-20th century developments in [[Minimalist art]], [[Abstract Expressionism]] and its [[Post-painterly Abstraction|offshoots]], plus [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], and other threads of artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Neo-minimalism&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artists who have been linked to the term, or who have been included in shows employing it, include [[Peter Halley]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Lorenzo Belenguer]], [[Ashley Bickerton]], David Burdeny, Paul Kuhn, Eve Leader, [[Peter Schuyff]], [[Christopher Willard]] and [[Tim Zuck]]. The steel sculptures of [[Richard Serra]] have been described as "austere neo-Minimalism...."&lt;ref&gt;Casey Nelson Blake, "An Atmosphere of Effrontery," in: ''The Power of Culture: Critical Essays in American History'', Richard Wightman Fox and [[T. J. Jackson Lears]], eds., Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993; p. 259 n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and music==
Beyond painting, sculpture and other "museum art," the term has been applied to architecture, design, and music.&lt;ref&gt;''Cadence: The American Review of Jazz and Blues'', Vol. 14 (1988), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, indeed, neo-minimalism has been identified as a part of "the new orthodoxy...."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Hodge, ed., ''Not Architecture But Evidence That It Exists'', Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1999; p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

"After the bacchanal of [[Postmodernism|post-modernism]], the time has again come for neo-minimalism, neo-ascetism, neo-denial and sublime poverty."&lt;ref&gt;Juhani Pallasmaa, ''Architecture in Miniature'', Museum of Finnish Architecture, 1991; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-primitivism''' was a Russian [[art movement]] which took its name from the 31-page pamphlet ''Neo-primitivizm'', by [[Aleksandr Shevchenko|Aleksandr]] {{harvtxt|Shevchenko|1913}}. In the pamphlet Shevchenko proposes a new style of modern painting which fuses elements of [[Cézanne]], [[Cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]] with traditional Russian '[[folk art]]' conventions and motifs, notably the [[russian icon]] and the [[lubok]].

==Neo-primitive artists==
Russian artists associated with Neo-primitivism include:

*[[David Burlyuk]]
*[[Marc Chagall]]
*[[Pavel Filonov]]
*[[Natalia Goncharova]]
*[[Mikhail Larionov]]
*[[Kasimir Malevich]]
*[[Aleksandr Shevchenko]]

'''Nocturne painting''' is a term coined by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] to describe a painting style that depicts scenes evocative of the night or subjects as they appear in a veil of light, in twilight, or in the absence of direct light. In a broader usage, the term has come to refer to any  [[Night in paintings (Western art)|painting of a night scene]],&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, Denis. (1992). ''Education And Politics For The 1990s: Conflict Or Consensus?'' (edition reprint). Psychology Press. p. 150. {{ISBN|0750700793}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or night-piece, such as [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]''.

Whistler used the term within the title of his works to represent paintings with a "dreamy, pensive mood" by applying a musical name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/8.htm |title=Tonalism and the "Nocturne  |publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also titled (and retitled) works using other terms associated with music, such as a "symphony", "harmony", "study" or "arrangement", to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ronald and Anne Koval. (2002). ''James McNeill Whistler: Beyond the Myth.'' De Capo Press. p. 186. {{ISBN|0-786-71032-2}}. (''Note: need to verify this was the edition used.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "nocturne" can be associated with the [[Tonalism]] movement of the American of the late 19th century and early 20th century which is "characterized by soft, diffused light, muted tones and hazy outlined objects, all of which imbue the works with a strong sense of mood."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Marter|Marter, Joan]]. (2011). ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1'' Oxford University Press. p. 54. {{ISBN|0195335791}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with winter scenes, nocturnes were a common Tonalist theme.&lt;ref&gt;Conrads, Margaret C. (1990). ''American Paintings and Sculpture at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute. Contributor: Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute. Hudson Hills. p. 148. {{ISBN|1555950507}}.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Frederic Remington]] used the term as well for his nocturne scenes of the [[American Old West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington08.shtm |title=Artistic experiments |publisher=National Gallery of Art |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington09.shtm |title=18 images of Remington’s nocturnes on 18 web pages |publisher=National Gallery of Art |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rembrandt’s nocturnes==
In northern [[Europe]], the [[Dutch Golden Age]] produced one of the greatest artists of all time. The first artist to paint scenes on a regular basis in the nocturne mode was [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] (1606–1669). Many of his portraits were also painted using a nocturne method. As in ''The Mill'' (1645), most of his landscapes were painted to evoke a sense of the nocturne, which could be expressed in either a calm or stormy manner.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/11/art|title=The Enduring Genius of Rembrandt|author=[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|date=11 February 2006|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Nocturne” was a term that was normally applied to certain types of musical compositions before [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] (1834–1903), [[Nocturne|inspired by the language of music]], began using the word within the titles of many of his works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/imagegallery.htm |title=Images of many of Whistler's nocturne paintings, and some by his contemporaries, can be seen at this website for the Detroict Institute of Arts |publisher=Dia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718033141/http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/imagegallery.htm |archivedate=2012-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''Nocturne in Blue and Silver'' (1871), in the collection of the [[Tate Gallery]], London, United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Anderson and Anne Koval, ''James McNeill Whistler: Beyond the Myth'', Carroll &amp; Graf, New York, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0786701872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frederic Remington’s nocturnes==
[[Frederic Remington|Frederic Remington (1861-1909)]] is so identified for his nocturne scenes of the [[American Old West]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington09.shtm |title=18 images of Remington’s nocturnes on 18 web pages at the National Gallery of Art |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they were celebrated in 2003-2004 with an exhibition, ''Frederic Remington: The Color of Night'', co-organized and shown in turn by the [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Gilcrease Museum]], [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington.htm |title='&amp;#39;The Color of Night'&amp;#39; exhibition website with extensive information and images about Frederic Remington and his paintings |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also generated a colorful book of the same title and travelled to the [[Denver Art Museum]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]. Remington painted many of his nocturnes in the last years of his life, when he was transitioning from a career as an [[illustrator]] to that of a fine artist and had chosen [[American Impressionism|Impressionism]] as the style in which he worked at the time. One example of his work is [http://agweb.okstate.edu/fourh/aitc/images/agart/stampede.jpg ''The Stampede'' (also known as ''The Stampede by Lightning'', 1908).]

'''Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät''' ('''PKN''', {{Langnf||Finnish|"Pertti Kurikka's [[name day]]s"}}) were a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[punk rock]] band, formed in 2009 in a charity workshop for adults with [[developmental disabilities]]. They are the main focus of the Finnish documentary film ''[[The Punk Syndrome]]''. In 2015, they qualified for the finals of [[Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu 2015|Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu]], which they later won; they represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 but got knocked out in the semi-final. The band disbanded in December 2016 when guitarist Pertti Kurikka turned 60 years old and retired from playing punk rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005022200.html|title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivien viimeisellä keikalla Tapaninpäivänä oli hikistä, ahdasta ja tunteikasta eli aivan mahtavaa|date=27 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2017|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation (2004-2012)===
Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät began in a workshop run by Lyhty, a charity for adults with developmental disabilities. In 2004, Pertti Kurikka, the future guitarist of the band, met organizer Kalle Pajamaa of Lyhty.&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"&gt;{{cite web| title = Never mind the mall punks, here’s Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät!| author = Arttu Tolonen| work =Finnish Music Quarterly |date=June 2013| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://www.fmq.fi/2013/06/never-mind-the-mall-punks-heres-pertti-kurikan-nimipaivat/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pajamaa, who remains manager of the band today, noticed Kurikka's potential and sought to establish a band based upon him.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015a"&gt;{{cite web| title = Nytpedia: Tällainen yhtye on Pertti Kurikan nimipäivät|trans-title=Nytpedia: This is what the band Pertti Kurikan nimipäivät is like| work =Nyt| date = 2 March 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://nyt.fi/a1305932608636| language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked on the band's formation over the next five years,&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt; and in 2009 the band made its debut.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015a"/&gt;

In 2009, Finnish director [[Pekka Karjalainen]] sought music performed by people with disabilities for the film ''[[Vähän kunnioitusta]]'',&lt;ref name="Nyt2015b"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Story of PKN, the Finnish punk sensation ready to rock Eurovision| work = Nyt| date = 3 March 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://nyt.fi/a1305933792584}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the story of a young girl with a [[learning disability]] aspiring to live an independent and normal life.&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt; Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät is featured in the film with their first-ever [[Demo (music)|demo]]: "Kallioon!".&lt;ref name="Tolonen2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mäenpää2015"&gt;{{cite web| title = Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät osallistuu Uuden Musiikin Kilpailuun| author = Arto Mäenpää| work =KaaosZine| date = 13 January 2015| accessdate = 6 March 2015| url = http://kaaoszine.fi/pertti-kurikan-nimipaivat-osallistuu-uuden-musiikin-kilpailuun/|trans-title=Pertti Kurikan Nimipäivät takes part in Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song became a hit, and the band soon discovered that they had a following outside the circle of disabled people.&lt;ref name="Nyt2015b"/&gt;

In 2012, their fame grew as they were the main subject of ''[[The Punk Syndrome]]'', a Finnish documentary film. The documentary, depicting the band's story from its outset to their first European tour, earned them a following in Scandinavia and Germany.&lt;ref name="Hay2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hay|first1=Mark|title=A Finnish Punk Band with Learning Disabilities Is Going to Eurovision|url=https://www.vice.com/read/a-finnish-punk-band-with-learning-disabilities-is-going-to-eurovision-189|website=VICE|accessdate=4 March 2015|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:schandbild.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] ''[[:de:schandbild|schandbild]]'' (circa 1490)]]

'''''Pittura infamante''''' ({{IPA-it|pitˈtuːra imfaˈmante|pron}}; [[Italian language|Italian]] for "defaming portrait"; plural ''pitture infamanti'') is a [[genre]] of [[defamation|defamatory]] [[painting]] and [[relief]], common in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] in [[city-state]]s in the north and center of the [[Italian Peninsula]] during the [[Trecento]], [[Quattrocento]], and [[Cinquecento]].&lt;ref name="edgerton"/&gt; Popular subjects of ''pittura infamante'' include [[treason|traitors]], [[theft|thieves]], and those guilty of [[bankruptcy]] or public [[fraud]], often in cases where no legal remedy was available. Commissioned by governments of [[city-state]]s and displayed in public centers, ''pittura infamante'' were both a form of "municipal justice" (or "forensic art"&lt;ref name="ed31"&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a medium for internal political struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Wieruszowski, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Samuel Edgerton, the genre began to decline precisely when it came to be regarded as a [[form of art]] rather than [[effigy]]; the power of the genre derived from a feudal-based [[code of honor]], where [[shame]] was one of the most significant [[social punishment]]s.&lt;ref name="edgerton"&gt;Edgerton, 1985. Chapters 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''pittura infamante'' has its roots in the doctrines of ''[[pheme|fama]]'' and ''[[infamia]]'' in ancient [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="mills38"&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
''Pitture infamanti'' could appear in any public place, but some places were more frequently adorned with them; for example, the first floor exterior of the [[Bargello]] periodically contained numerous, life-size, ''pittura infamante'' [[fresco]]es. Florentine law required the ''[[Podestà]]]'' have such caricatures painted, and accompanied by verbal identification those held in [[contempt of court]] for financial offenses (bad debt, bankruptcy, fraud, forgery, etc.).&lt;ref name="ed2"/&gt; ''Pitture infamanti'' were far more common in [[Republic of Florence|Republican Florence]] than in [[Italian city-states|autocratic city states]], whose rulers often deemed them to be sources of "disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Common themes of ''pittura infamante''&amp;mdash;which were meant to be humiliating&amp;mdash;include depicting the subject as wearing a mitre or hanging upside down, being in the presence of unclean animals such as pigs or donkeys or those deemed evil like snakes; ''pittura infamante'' would also contain captions listing the offenses of the subject.&lt;ref name="dean7"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pittura infamante'' could originate as more favorable depictions, only to be transformed after the subject had fallen out of favor.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imagery==
''Pittura infamante'' always depicted men and never women, and generally depicted upper class men (who would have the most to lose from [[character assassination]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The act of hanging itself was also significant, as affluent criminals would generally be afforded the privilege of beheading rather than hanging; hanging was also shameful in religious contexts (e.g. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]).&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt; The [[Literary topos|topos]] of ''mundus inversus'' ("world upside down") is often associated with comedy and humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous artists who painted ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes include [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Andrea del Sarto]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, 1980, p. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no surviving examples of ''pitture infamanti'' frescoes, but contemporary sources suggest that they were brightly colored.&lt;ref name="ed31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dean7"/&gt; Detailed descriptions of ''pitture infamanti'' in primary sources are rare.&lt;ref name="dean45"&gt;Dean, 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; A very few preparatory drawings, however, are extant, and [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|The Hanged Man]] from [[Tarot]] cards is thought to resemble the archetypal ''pittura infamante'' theme, as Tarot decks were first produced in northern Italy in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="mills38"/&gt;

==Records==
Documentary evidence for ''pittura infamante'' outside Italy is rarer but existent. For example, records support the use of "very unpleasant pictures" painted on cloths during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the reign of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] in [[France]], and&amp;mdash;later&amp;mdash;in [[England]] and north [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pitture infamanti'' were the counterpoint of another contemporary form of secular, full-length portrait: ''uomini famosi'' ("famous men") or ''uomini illustri'' ("illustrious men"), which depicted figures from the [[Old Testament]] or [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] in a positive context, generally on the interior of private or civic buildings as moral exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Scene and sequel''' are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[narrative|story]]. ''Scenes'' propel a story forward as the [[character (arts)|character]] attempts to achieve a goal.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"&gt;Swain, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sequels'' provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The concept of a scene in written [[fiction]] has evolved over many years. [[Dwight V. Swain]], in ''Techniques of the Selling Writer'' (1965) defined a ''scene'' as a unit of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"/&gt;

In ''The Art of Fiction'' (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of ''scene'', and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a ''sequel'' as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) [[dilemma]], and (3) decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a ''sequel'' and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive vs. reactive==
Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 61, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes and sequels==
Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that

*An author controls [[Pace (narrative)|pacing]] by the way he proportions scene to sequel.
*The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels.
*Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural units of fiction== 
The ''structural units of [[fiction writing]]'' comprise all fiction.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The smallest units of writing are [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[paragraph]]s.
*Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as ''passages'' or ''segments'' of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A ''scene'' is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A ''sequel'' is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a ''chapter break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Prologue]]'' and ''[[epilogue]]'' are two specialized types of chapters.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"/&gt;
*A chapter may include one or more ''sections'', passages separated by another form of punctuation called a ''section break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some [[novel]]s, especially long ones, may be further divided into ''books'' or ''parts'', each including two or more chapters.

==Types of passages==
Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are ''neither'' scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of ''both'' scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include ''fragments''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  of scenes or sequels and passages of [[narration]], [[description]], or [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]]. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the ''problem-solving passage'', common in [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[detective stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of scenes==
Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] scene). A scene may be classified by the [[fiction-writing mode]] that dominates its presentation (as in an [[action fiction|action]] scene or a [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes and [[flashforward]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-portrait''' is a representation of an artist that is drawn, painted, photographed, or sculpted by that artist. Although self-portraits have been made since the earliest times, it is not until the [[Early Renaissance]] in the mid-15th century that artists can be frequently identified depicting themselves as either the main subject, or as important characters in their work.  With better and cheaper [[mirror]]s, and the advent of the [[panel painting|panel]] portrait, many painters, sculptors and printmakers tried some form of '''self-portraiture'''. ''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]] of 1433 may well be the earliest known panel self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Lorne|series=National Gallery Catalogues (new series)|title=The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings|pages=212–17|year=1998|isbn=1-85709-171-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted a separate portrait of his wife, and he belonged to the social group that had begun to commission portraits, already more common among wealthy Netherlanders than south of the Alps.  The genre is venerable, but not until the [[Renaissance]], with increased wealth and interest in the individual as a subject, did it become truly popular.&lt;ref name="research.umbc.edu"&gt;[http://www.research.umbc.edu/~ivy/selfportrait/back.html accessed online July 28, 2007 an online history of self-portraits, various excerpts from Edward Lucie-Smith and Sean Kelly, ''The Self Portrait: A Modern View'' (London: Sarema Press, 1987)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903144700/http://www.research.umbc.edu/~ivy/selfportrait/back.html |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-portrait may be a [[portrait]] of the artist, or a portrait included in a larger work, including a group portrait.  Many painters are said to have included depictions of specific individuals, including themselves, in painting figures in religious or other types of composition. Such paintings were not intended publicly to depict the actual persons as themselves, but the facts would have been known at the time to artist and [[Patron#Arts|patron]], creating a talking point as well as a public test of the artist's skill.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lorne, ''Renaissance Portraits, European Portrait-Painting in the 14th, 15th and 16th Centuries'', pp. 3-4, 1990, Yale, {{ISBN|0-300-04675-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest surviving examples of medieval and [[Renaissance]] self-portraiture, historical or mythical scenes (from the [[Bible]] or [[classical literature]]) were depicted using a number of actual persons as models, often including the artist, giving the work a multiple function as portraiture, self-portraiture and history/myth painting. In these works, the artist usually appears as a face in the crowd or group, often towards the edges or corner of the work and behind the main participants. [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s ''The Four Philosophers'' (1611–12)&lt;ref name="Four Philosophers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Gallery of Art: Rubens, Pieter Pauwel – The Four Philosophers, 1611–12|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/r/rubens/41portra/09philos.html | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example. This culminated in the 17th century with the work of [[Jan de Bray]]. Many artistic media have been used; apart from paintings, drawings and [[old master print|prints]] have been especially important.

In the famous ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' (1434), [[Jan van Eyck]] is probably one of two figures glimpsed in a mirror – a surprisingly modern conceit. The Van Eyck painting may have inspired [[Diego Velázquez]] to depict himself in full view as the painter creating ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (1656), as the Van Eyck hung in the palace in Madrid where he worked. This was another modern flourish, given that he appears as the painter (previously unseen in official royal portraiture) and standing close to the King's family group who were the supposed main subjects of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lorne; National Gallery Catalogues (new series): ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings'', pp 180, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85709-171-X}}, {{OL|392219M}}, {{OCLC|40732051}}, {{LCCN|98066510}}, (also titled ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Schools''). The ''Arnolfini Portrait'' hung in the same palace in Madrid in which ''Las Meninas'' was painted&lt;/ref&gt;

In what may be one of the earliest childhood self-portraits now surviving, [[Albrecht Dürer]] depicts himself as in naturalistic style as a 13-year-old boy in 1484. In later years he appears variously as a merchant in the background of [[Biblical]] scenes and as [[Christ]].&lt;ref name="Durer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy: The graphic work of a Renaissance artist|url=http://www.studio-international.co.uk/painting/durer.asp | publisher=Studio International Magazine | date=March 2003 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] may have drawn a [[Self-portrait (Leonardo da Vinci)|picture of himself]] at the age of 60, in around 1512. The picture is often straightforwardly reproduced as Da Vinci's appearance, although this is not certain.

In the 17th century, [[Rembrandt]] painted a range of self-portraits. In ''[[The Prodigal Son in the Tavern]]'' (c1637), one of the earliest self-portraits with family, the painting probably includes Saskia, Rembrandt's wife, one of the earliest depictions of a family member by a famous artist. Family and professional group paintings, including the artist's depiction, became increasingly common from the 17th century on. From the later 20th century on, video plays an increasing part in self-portraiture, and adds the dimension of audio as well, allowing the person to speak to us in their own voice.

===Gallery: Inserted self-portraits===

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Botticelli - Adoration of the Magi (Zanobi Altar) - Uffizi.jpg|[[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting of the ''[[Adoration of the Magi of 1475 (Botticelli)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' has an "inserted self-portrait". The position in the (right) corner, and the gaze out to the viewer, are very typical of such self-portraits.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Women painters===
[[Women artists]] are notable producers of self-portraits; almost all significant women painters have left an example, from [[Caterina van Hemessen]] to the prolific [[Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]], and [[Frida Kahlo]], as well as [[Alice Neel]], [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]] and [[Jenny Saville]] who painted themselves in the nude.  Vigée-Lebrun painted a total of 37 self-portraits, many of which were copies of earlier ones, painted for sale. Until the 20th century women were usually unable to train in drawing the nude, which made it difficult for them to paint large figure compositions, leading many artists to specialize in portrait work. Women artists have historically embodied a number of roles within their self-portraiture. Most common is the artist at work, showing themselves in the act of painting, or at least holding a brush and palette. Often, the viewer wonders if the clothes worn were those they normally painted in, as the elaborate nature of many ensembles was an artistic choice to show her skill at fine detail.

== Antiquity ==
Images of artists at work are encountered in [[Ancient Egypt]]ian painting, and sculpture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/egypt/amarna/akh_patron/akh_patron_page2.html|title=Pharaohs Of The Sun|date=19 June 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619031921/http://www.mfa.org/egypt/amarna/akh_patron/akh_patron_page2.html|archivedate=19 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also on [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[vase]]s. One of the first self-portraits was made by the Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]'s chief sculptor Bak in 1365 BC. [[Plutarch]] mentions that the Ancient Greek sculptor [[Phidias]] had included a likeness of himself in a number of characters in the "[[Amazonomachy|Battle of the Amazons]]" on the [[Parthenon]], and there are classical references to painted self-portraits, none of which have survived.

==Asia==
Portraits and self-portraits have a longer continuous history in Asian art than in Europe.  Many in the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar gentleman]] tradition are quite small, depicting the artist in a large landscape, illustrating a poem in [[calligraphy]] on his experience of the scene.  Another tradition, associated with [[Zen Buddhism]], produced lively semi-caricatured self-portraits, whilst others remain closer to the conventions of the formal portrait.

[[Illuminated manuscripts]] contain a number of apparent self-portraits, notably those of Saint [[Dunstan]] and [[Matthew Paris]].  Most of these either show the artist at work, or presenting the finished book to either a donor or a sacred figure, or venerating such a figure.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathon Alexander; ''Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work''; p.8-34, Yale UP, 1992, {{ISBN|0-300-05689-3}} collects several examples&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Orcagna]] is believed to have painted himself as a figure in a [[fresco]] of 1359,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} which became, at least according to [[art historian]]s — [[Vasari]] records a number of such traditions — a common practice of artists.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} However, for earlier artists, with no other portrait to compare to, these descriptions are necessarily rather speculative. Among the earliest self-portraits are also two frescos by [[:File:Aquila Johannes – Self-portrait (1392).jpg|Johannes Aquila]], one in [[Velemér]] (1378), western Hungary, and one in [[Martjanci]] (1392), northeastern Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA527 |title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture |first=Colum |last=Hourihane |chapter=Johannes Aquila de Rakerspurga |page=527 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-539536-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy [[Giotto di Bondone]] (1267–1337) included himself in the cycle of "eminent men" in the Castle of Naples, [[Masaccio]] (1401–1428) depicted himself as one of the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] in the painting of the [[Brancacci Chapel]], and [[Benozzo Gozzoli]] includes himself, with other portraits, in the [[Palazzo Medici]] ''Procession of the Magi'' (1459), with his name written on his hat. This is imitated a few years later by [[Sandro Botticelli]], as a spectator of ''the [[Adoration of the Magi of 1475 (Botticelli)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' (1475), who turns from the scene to look at us.
Fourteenth-century sculpted portrait busts of and by the [[Peter Parler|Parler family]] in [[Prague Cathedral]] include self-portraits, and are among the earliest such busts of non-royal figures. [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] included a small head of himself in his [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)#Baptistery doors|most famous work]].
Notably, the earliest self-portrait painted in England, other than in a [[manuscript]], is the miniature painted in oils on panel by the German artist [[Gerlach Flicke]], 1554.

===Albrecht Dürer, 1471–1528, the first prolific self-portraitist===

[[Albrecht Dürer]] was an artist highly conscious of his public image and reputation, whose main income came from his [[old master print]]s, all containing his famous monogram, which were sold throughout Europe.  He probably depicted himself more often than any artist before him, producing at least twelve images, including three oil portraits, and figures in four [[altarpiece]]s.  The earliest is a [[silverpoint]] drawing created when he was thirteen years old.  At twenty-two Dürer painted the ''Self-portrait with Carnation'' (1493, Louvre), probably to send to his new fiancée.  The Madrid self-portrait (1498, [[Museo del Prado|Prado]]) depicts Dürer as a dandy in fashionable Italian dress, reflecting the international success he had achieved by then.  In [[Self-Portrait (Dürer)|his last self-portrait]], sold or given to the city of [[Nuremberg]], and displayed publicly, which very few portraits then were, the artist depicted himself with an unmistakable resemblance to [[Jesus Christ]] (Munich, [[Alte Pinakothek]]).  He later re-used the face in a religious engraving of, revealingly, the [[Veil of Veronica]], Christ's own "self-portrait" (B.25).  A self-portrait in [[gouache]] he sent to [[Raphael]] has not survived. A woodcut of a bathhouse and a drawing show virtually nude self-portraits.&lt;ref&gt;For all this section, Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy'', p. 77–84 &amp; passim, British Museum Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance and Baroque===
The great Italian painters of the Renaissance made comparatively few formal painted self-portraits, but often included themselves in larger works. Most individual self-portraits they have left were straightforward depictions; Dürer's showmanship was rarely followed, although a controversially attributed ''Self-portrait as David'' by [[Giorgione]] would have something of the same spirit, if it is a self-portrait. There is a portrait by [[Pietro Perugino]] of about 1500 (Collegio del Cambio of [[Perugia]]), and one by the young [[Parmigianino]] showing the view in a convex mirror. There is also a drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1512),&lt;ref&gt;This drawing in red chalk is widely (though not universally) accepted as an original self-portrait. The main reason for hesitation in accepting it as a portrait of Leonardo is that the subject is apparently of a greater age than Leonardo ever achieved. But it is possible that he drew this picture of himself deliberately aged, specifically for Raphael's portrait of him in the [[School of Athens]]. A case has also been made, originally by novelist [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]], that Leonardo based his famous picture ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' on his own self-portrait.&lt;/ref&gt; and self-portraits in larger works by [[Michelangelo]], who gave his face to the skin of [[St. Bartholomew]] in the ''[[Last Judgement]]'' of the [[Sistine Chapel]] (1536–1541), and [[Raphael]] who is seen in the characters of ''[[School of Athens]]'' 1510, or with a friend who holds his shoulder (1518). Also notable are two [[Self-Portrait (Titian, Madrid)|portraits]] of [[Titian]] as an old man in the 1560s. [[Paolo Veronese]] appears as a violinist clothed in white in his ''[[Marriage at Cana]]'', accompanied by Titian on the [[bass viol]] (1562).  Northern artists continued to make more individual portraits, often looking very much like their other bourgeois sitters. [[Johan Gregor van der Schardt]] produced a painted [[terracotta]] bust of himself (c. 1573).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Johan Gregor van der Schardt and the Moment of Self-Portraiture in Sculpture |first=Frits |last=Scholten |pages=195–220 |journal=Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art |volume=33 |issue=4 |year=2008 |jstor=25608493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Titian]]'s ''[[Allegory of Prudence]]'' (c. 1565–70) is thought to depict Titian, his son Orazio, and a young cousin, Marco Vecellio.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] (and originally [[Fritz Saxl]]), ''Titian's "Allegory of Prudence", A Postscript'', in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'', Doubleday/Penguin, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Titian also painted a late self-portrait in 1567; apparently his first. Baroque artist [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]'s ''La Pittura (Self-portrait as the allegory of painting)'' presents herself embodying the classical allegorical representation of Painting, seen in the dramatic mask worn around Gentileschi's neck which Painting often carries. The artist's focus on her work, away from the viewer, highlights the drama of the Baroque period, and the changing role of the artist from craftsperson to singular innovator.&lt;ref name="Frances Borzello 1998"&gt;[[Frances Borzello]], ''Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self-Portraiture'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caravaggio]] painted himself in ''[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]'' at the beginning of his career, then appears in the [[staffage]] of some of his larger paintings. Finally, the head of [[Goliath]] held by [[David]] (1605–10, [[Galleria Borghese]]) is Caravaggio's own.

===Rembrandt and the 17th century in Northern Europe===
In the 17th century,  [[Flanders|Flemish]] and Dutch artists painted themselves far more often; by this date most successful artists had a position in society where a member of any trade would consider having their portrait painted. Many also include their families, again following the normal practice for the middle-classes. [[Mary Beale]], [[Anthony van Dyck]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens]] gave us numerous images of themselves, the latter also often painting his family. This practice was especially common for women artists, whose inclusion of their families was often a deliberate attempt to mitigate criticism of their profession causing distraction from their "natural role" as mothers.&lt;ref name="Frances Borzello 1998"/&gt;

[[Rembrandt]] was the most frequent self-portraitist, at least until the self-obsessed modern period, also often painting his wife, son and mistress. At one time about ninety paintings were counted as Rembrandt self-portraits, but it is now known that he had his students copy his own self-portraits as part of their training. Modern scholarship has reduced the autograph count to something over forty paintings, as well as a few drawings and thirty-one [[etching]]s, which include many of the most remarkable images of the group. Many show him posing in quasi-historical fancy dress, or pulling faces at himself. His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man to the dapper and very successful portrait-painter of the 1630s to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his old age.&lt;ref&gt;For this section and the gallery, [[Ernst van de Wetering]] in ''Rembrandt by himself'', p.10 and passim, 1999, National Gallery, London/Mauritshuis, The Hague, {{ISBN|1-85709-270-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Rembrandt===
[[File:VanGogh-self-portrait-with bandaged ear.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Self-Portrait of [[Van Gogh]] with head bandaged, after he (debatedly) cut off part of his ear.]]
In Spain, there were self-portraits of [[Bartolomé Estéban Murillo]] and [[Diego Velázquez]]. [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] represented himself in [[Luke the Evangelist]] at the feet of Christ on the cross (around 1635). In the 19th century, Goya painted himself numerous times. French self-portraits, at least after [[Nicolas Poussin]] tend to show the social status of the artist, although [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] and some other instead showed their real working costume very realistically.  This was a decision all 18th-century self-portraitists needed to make, although many painted themselves in both formal and informal costume in different paintings. Thereafter, one can say that most significant painters left us at least one self-portrait, even after the decline of the painted portrait with the arrival of photography. [[Gustave Courbet]] (see below) was perhaps the most creative self-portraitist of the 19th century, and ''The Artist's studio'' and ''Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet'' are perhaps the largest self-portraits ever painted. Both contain many figures, but are firmly centred on the heroic figure of the artist.

One of the most famous and most prolific of self-portraitists was [[Vincent van Gogh]], who drew and painted himself more than [[Self-portraits by Vincent van Gogh|43 times]] between 1886 and 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/portrait-de-lartiste-433.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=b052379f62|title=Musée d'Orsay: Vincent van Gogh Self-Portrait|website=www.musee-orsay.fr|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/genres/self-portraits.htm Encyclopedia of Irish and World Art, art of self-portrait] Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these self-portraits one is struck that the gaze of the painter is seldom directed at us; even when it is a fixed gaze, he seems to look elsewhere. These paintings vary in intensity and color and some portray the artist with bandages; representing the episode in which he severed one of his ears.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TEgP2yBPb_sC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=national+gallery+of+art+on+van+gogh+self+portraits&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5ePtn0FWSA&amp;sig=sDtbzXn5lZIYXDOkLk-N91IfFjE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NQQVTM7RM4OClAemz4HgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20gallery%20of%20art%20on%20van%20gogh%20self%20portraits&amp;f=false  Andrea Bassil, ''Lives of the Artists, Vincent van Gogh'' pp.36-37] Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The many self-portraits of [[Egon Schiele]] set new standards of openness, or perhaps  [[exhibitionism]], representing him naked in many positions, sometimes masturbating or with an erection, as in ''Eros'' (1911).  [[Stanley Spencer]] was to follow somewhat in this vein.  [[Max Beckmann]] was a prolific painter of self-portraits &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gagosian.com/publications/1992_max-beckmann_the-self-portraits/ ''Max Beckmann, The Self Portraits''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029133400/http://www.gagosian.com/publications/1992_max-beckmann_the-self-portraits/ |date=2011-10-29 }} Retrieved October 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as was [[Edvard Munch]] who made great numbers of self-portrait paintings (70),  prints (20) and drawings or watercolours (over 100) throughout his life, many showing him being badly treated by life, and especially by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munch.museum.no/exhibitions.aspx?id=35|title=Fant ikke siden – Munch|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927094502/http://www.munch.museum.no/exhibitions.aspx?id=35|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Obsessively using the self-portrait as a personal and introspective artistic expression was [[Horst Janssen]], who produced hundreds of self-portraits depicting him a wide range of contexts most notably in relation to sickness, moodyness and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahagoni-magazin.de/graphik/horst-janssen-selbstportraits-%E2%80%93-am-abgrund-des-spiegels|title=Horst Janssen: Selbstportraits – am Abgrund des Spiegels|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 exhibition "Schiele, Janssen. Selbstinszenierung, Eros, Tod" (Schiele, Janssen: Self-dramatisation, Eros, Death) at the Leopold Museum in Vienna paralleled the works of [[Egon Schiele]] and [[Horst Janssen]], both heavily drawing on sujets of erotica and death in combination with relentless self-portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basis-wien.at/db/event/61447|title=basis wien - Schiele, Janssen. Selbstinszenierung, Eros, Tod|first=basis|last=wien|website=www.basis-wien.at|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frida Kahlo]], who following a terrible accident spent many years bedridden, with only herself for a model, was another painter whose self-portraits depict great pain, in her case physical as well as mental.  Her 55-odd self-portraits include many of herself from the waist up, and also some nightmarish representations which symbolize her physical sufferings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amybrown.net/women/frida.html ''Amazing women'' Frida Kahlo, ''I am not sick.

Throughout his long career, [[Pablo Picasso]] often used self-portraits to depict himself in the many different guises, disguises and incarnations of his autobiographical artistic persona. From the young unknown "Yo [[Picasso]]" period to the "[[Minotaur]] in the [[Labyrinth]]" period, to the "old [[Cavalier]]" and the "lecherous old artist and model" periods. Often Picasso's self-portraits depicted and revealed complicated psychological insights, both personal and profound about the inner state and well being of the artist. Another artist who painted personal and revealing self-portraits throughout his career was [[Pierre Bonnard]]. Bonnard also painted dozens of portraits of his wife Marthe throughout her life as well. [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Egon Schiele]] and [[Horst Janssen]] in particular made intense (at times disturbingly so) and self-revealing self-portraits throughout their careers.

Many of the medieval portraits show the artist at work, and Jan van Eyck (above) his [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon hat]] has the parts normally hanging loose tied up on his head, giving the misleading impression he is wearing a turban, presumably for convenience whilst he paints.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lorne; National Gallery Catalogues (new series): ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings'', pp 214, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85709-171-X}}, {{OL|392219M}}, {{OCLC|40732051}}, {{LCCN|98066510}}, (also titled ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Schools'')&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[early modern period]], increasingly, men as well as women who painted themselves at work had to choose whether to present themselves in their best clothes, and best room, or to depict studio practice realistically.

===Classification===
Art critic Galina Vasilyeva-Shlyapina separates two basic forms of the self-portrait: "professional" portraits, in which the artist is depicted at work, and "personal" portraits, which reveal moral and psychological features. She also proposes a more detailed taxonomy: (1) the "insertable" self-portrait, where the artist inserts his or her own portrait into, for example, a group of characters related to some subject; (2) the "prestigious, or symbolic" self-portrait, where an artist depicts him- or herself in the guise of a historical person or religious hero; (3) the "group portrait" where artist is depicted with members of family or other real persons; (4) the "separate or natural" self-portrait, where the artist is depicted alone.  However it might be thought these classes are rather rigid; many portraits manage to combine several of them.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively, the ''"вставной"'',''"представительский, или символический"'', ''"групповой портрет"'', ''"отдельный или естественный"''&lt;/ref&gt;

With new media came a chance to create different kinds of self-portraits besides simply static painting or photographs. Many people, especially teens, use social networking sites to form their own personal identity on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;danah boyd. "Why Youth (Heart) Social Networking Sites: The Role of Networked Publics in Teenage Social Life." MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Learning, Identity Volume. ed. David Buckingham.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others use blogs or create personal web pages to create a space for self-expression and self-portraiture.

===Mirrors and poses===

[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Las Meninas]]'', painted in 1656, shows [[Diego Velázquez]] working at the easel to the left.]]

The self-portrait supposes in theory the use of a [[mirror]]; glass mirrors became available in Europe in the 15th century.  The first mirrors used were convex, introducing deformations that the artist sometimes preserved. A painting by [[Parmigianino]] in 1524 ''Self-portrait in a mirror'', demonstrates the phenomenon.  Mirrors permit surprising compositions like the ''Triple self-portrait'' by [[Johannes Gumpp]] (1646), or more recently that of [[Salvador Dalí]] shown from the back painting his wife, [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] (1972–73).
This use of the mirror often results in right-handed painters representing themselves as left-handed (and vice versa). Usually the face painted is therefore a mirror image of that the rest of the world saw, unless two mirrors were used.  Most of Rembrandt's self-portraits before 1660 show only one hand – the painting hand is left unpainted.&lt;ref&gt;''Rembrandt by himself'', op cit, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;  He appears to have bought a larger mirror in about 1652, after which his self-portraits become larger. In 1658 a large mirror in a wood frame broke whilst being transported to his house; nonetheless, in this year he completed his Frick self-portrait, his largest.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The size of single-sheet mirrors was restricted until technical advances made in France in 1688 by [[Bernard Perrot]].  They also remained very fragile, and large ones were much more expensive pro-rata than small ones – the breakages were recut into small pieces.  About 80&amp;nbsp;cm, or two and a half feet, seems to have been the maximum size until then – roughly the size of the palace mirror in ''Las Meninas'' (the convex mirror in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' is considered by historians impractically large, one of Van Eyck's many cunning distortions of scale).&lt;ref&gt;''Rembrandt by himself'', op cit, pp 11-13; for the Arnolfini reference see: National Gallery Catalogues (new series): ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings'', Lorne Campbell, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85709-171-X}}, {{OL|392219M}}, {{OCLC|40732051}}, {{LCCN|98066510}}, (also titled ''The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Schools'')&lt;/ref&gt; Largely for this reason, most early self-portraits show painters at no more than half-length.
 
Self-portraits of the artist at work were, as mentioned above, the commonest form of medieval self-portrait, and these have continued to be popular, with a specially large number from the 18th century on.  One particular type in the medieval and Renaissance periods was the artist shown as Saint [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] (patron saint of artists) painting the [[Virgin Mary]].  Many of these were presented to the local [[Guild of Saint Luke]], to be placed in their chapel.  A famous large view of the artist in his studio is ''[[The Artist's Studio]]'' by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1855), an immense "Allegory" of objects and characters amid which the painter sits.

The self-portraits of many [[Contemporary art]]ists and [[Modernist]]s often are characterized by a strong sense of [[narrative]], often but not strictly limited to vignettes from the artists life-story. Sometimes the narrative resembles fantasy, roleplaying and fiction. Besides [[Diego Velázquez]], (in his painting [[Las Meninas]]), [[Rembrandt Van Rijn]], [[Jan de Bray]], Gustave Courbet, [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Paul Gauguin]] other artists whose self-portraits reveal complex narratives include [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Lucas Samaras]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Gilbert and George]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Self-promotion===
The self-portrait can be a very effective form of advertising for an artist, especially of course for a portrait painter.  Dürer was not really interested in portraits commercially, but made good use of his extraordinary self-portraits to advertise himself as an artist, something he was very sophisticated in doing. [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] painted intricate miniatures which served as advertisements for her skill as well as novelty items, considered such because the rarity of successful women painters provided them with an oddity quality.&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; Rembrandt made his living principally from portrait-painting during his most successful period, and like [[Van Dyck]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], many of his portraits were certainly intended to advertise his skills.  With the advent of regular Academy shows, many artists tried to produce memorable self-portraits to make an impression on the artistic stage.  A recent exhibition at the National Gallery, London, ''Rebels and Martyrs'', did not shrink from the comic bathos that sometimes resulted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/rebels_martyrs/default.htm Rebels and Martyrs, National Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819201018/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/rebels_martyrs/default.htm |date=2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example from the 21st century is [[Arnaud Prinstet]], &lt;!-- notable? Bit of a self-promoter, I suspect this is vanity – Jmabel --&gt; an otherwise little-known contemporary artist who has generated good amounts of publicity by undertaking to paint his self-portrait every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Arnaud+Prinstet&amp;hl=en&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-32,GGLG:en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N|title=Arnaud Prinstet - Google Search|website=www.google.com|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some artists depicted themselves very much as they did other clients.

== Diagnosing the self-portrait ==
[[File:Egon Schiele 073.jpg|thumb|120px|Self-portrait of Egon Schiele 1911, depicting [[masturbation]].]]
Some artists who suffered neurological or physical diseases have left self-portraits of themselves that have allowed later physicians to attempt to analyze disruptions of mental processes; and many of these analyses have entered into the textbooks of [[neurology]].&lt;ref name="research.umbc.edu"/&gt;

The self-portraits of artists who suffered mental illnesses give a unique possibility to physicians for investigating self-perception in people with psychological, psychiatric or neurologic disturbances.

Russian sexologist [[Igor Kon]] in his article about [[masturbation]] notes that a habit of masturbating may be depicted in works of art, particularly paintings. So Austrian artist Egon Schiele depicted himself so occupied in one of his self-portraits. Kon observes that this painting does not portray [[pleasure]] from the masturbation, but a feeling of [[solitude]]. Creations of Schiele are analyzed by other researchers in terms of [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]], and particularly [[pedophilia]].

==Collections==
One of the most distinguished, and oldest, collections of self-portraits is in the [[Vasari Corridor]] of the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]]. It was originally the collection by the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Leopoldo de' Medici]] in the second part of the 17th century and has been maintained and expanded until the present time. It is mostly not on view for general visitors, although some paintings are shown in the main galleries.  Many famous artists have not been able to resist an invitation to donate a self-portrait to the collection.  It comprises more than 200 portraits, in particular those of [[Pietro da Cortona]], [[Charles Le Brun]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Other important collections are housed at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)]] in London (with various satellite outstations elsewhere), and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C..

===Photo-portraits===
{{see also|Francesca Woodman|Cindy Sherman|George Chakravarthi|selfie|space selfie}}
Two methods of obtaining photographic self-portraits are widespread. One is photographing a reflection in the mirror, and the other photographing one's self with the camera in an outstretched hand. [[Eleazar Langman]] photographed his reflection on the surface of a nickel-plated teapot.

Another method involves setting the camera or capture device upon a tripod, or surface. One might then set the camera's timer, or use a remote controlled shutter release.

Finally, setting up the camera, entering the scene and having an assistant release the shutter (i.e., if the presence of a cable release is unwanted in the photo) can arguably be regarded as a photographic self-portrait, as well. The speed of creating photographic self-portraits allowed for a range of images with more of a "play" atmosphere than traditional methods. One such example is [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]]'s ''Self-Portrait, c. 1896'', an image which demonstrates the photo-portrait's ability to play with gender roles.&lt;ref name="Frances Borzello 1998"/&gt;

Meanwhile, each human reason contains the self-portrait, which contains the self-appraisal of cognitive processes. This self-portrait assumes that the actions of man are governed by thoughts and, thus, the body is governed by consciousness. Self-portrait leads to the persuasion, that we consciously desire to make something. Studies show that self-portraiture is a caricature on the function of the brain, but at the same time it is the basis of the sensation of authorship and responsibility of one's own actions.&lt;/span&gt;

'''Shaped canvases''' are [[painting]]s that depart from the normal flat, rectangular configuration. [[Canvas]]es may be shaped by altering their outline, while retaining their flatness. An ancient, traditional example is the ''[[Tondo (art)|tondo]]'', a painting on a round panel or canvas: [[Raphael]], as well as some other Renaissance painters, sometimes chose this format for [[Madonna (art)|madonna]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistory.about.com/od/renaissanceart/l/bl_debrecy_tondo.htm Arthistory.about.com] page on Raphael's "de Brécy" tondo canvas painting&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, canvases may be altered by losing their flatness and assuming a three-dimensional surface. Or, they can do both. That is, they can assume shapes other than rectangles, and also have surface features that are three-dimensional. Arguably, changing the surface configuration of the painting transforms it into a sculpture. But shaped canvases are generally considered paintings.

Apart from any aesthetic considerations, there are technical matters, having to do with the very nature of canvas as a material, that tend to support the flat rectangle as the norm for paintings on canvas. (See [[#Departing from the rectangular|Departing from the rectangular]] below.)

In the literature of art history and criticism, the term ''shaped canvas'' is particularly associated with certain works created mostly in New York after about 1960, during a period when a great variety and quantity of such works were produced. According to the commentary at a [[Rutgers University]] exhibition site, "... the first significant art historical attention paid to shaped canvases occurred in the 1960s...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://zamweb.rutgers.edu/exhibitions/?id=41 Image of a 1935 Abraham Joel Tobias shaped-canvas painting at the Zimmerli Art Museum] ([[Rutgers University]])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pioneers of modern shaped-canvas painting ==
Abraham Joel Tobias made "shaped canvases" in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, Jeffrey;  Abraham Joel Tobias;  Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum.;  Queens Museum. [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/18137181?tab=details ''Abraham Joel Tobias : sculptural paintings of the 1930s''] (New Brunswick, N.J. : The Museum, 1987) OCLC 18137181&lt;/ref&gt; Uruguayan artist Rhod Rothfuss began to experience with "marco irregular" paintings in 1942, late in 1944 publish in Arturo magazine your seminal text "El marco: un problema de la plástica actual" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coleccioncisneros.org/aw_rel.asp?ID_Gallery=11&amp;CountOrder=4 Colección Cisneros] "Arlequin 1944"&lt;/ref&gt; Munich-born painter Rupprecht Geiger exhibited "shaped canvases" in 1948 in Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenbachhaus.de/cms/index.php?id=53&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=62&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1&amp;cHash=dffe792541 Lenbachhaus – Rupprecht Geiger zum 100.

Paintings exhibited by the [[New Orleans]] born abstract painter [[Edward Clark (artist)|Edward Clark]] shown at New York's [[Tenth Street galleries#Brata Gallery|Brata Gallery]] in 1957 have also been termed shaped canvas paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/edward-clark-41|title=Edward Clark – The HistoryMakers|work=thehistorymakers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2230 Metro Times Book review of ''Edward Clark: For the Sake of the Search'' in the Detroit Metro Times], stating that Clark is "widely credited with making the first extended shape painting (continuing the painting out of its rectangular frame with paper and wood) in 1956. "It wasn't called a shape painting then, just something strange and different that began with that painting," Clark said. The untitled work was shown in 1957 at the Brata Gallery..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the late 1950s through the mid-1960s [[Jasper Johns]] experimented with shaped and compartmentalized canvases, notably with his '[[American Flag]] [[Painting]]' – one canvas placed on top of another, larger canvas. [[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s experimental [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]] and "combines" of the 1950s also explored variations of divided and shaped canvas. Argentine artist [[Lucio Fontana]] also began early on the experiment in shaped and compartmentalized canvases with his Concetto Spaziale, Attese series in 1959. Assigning a date to the origin of the postwar shaped canvas painting may not be possible&lt;!-- see this article's discussion page--&gt;, but certainly it had emerged by the late 1950s.

== Postwar modern art and the shaped canvas ==
Frances Colpitt ("The Shape of Painting in the 1960s"; ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]'', Spring 1991) states flatly that "the shaped canvas was the dominant form of abstract painting in the 1960s". She writes that the shaped canvas, "although frequently described as a hybrid of painting and sculpture, grew out of the issues of abstract painting and was evidence of the desire of painters to move into real space by rejecting behind-the-frame illusionism." .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/777086 ''The Shape of Paintings in the 1960s''] Retrieved June 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Charles Hinman]] [[Ronald Davis]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Leo Valledor]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[John Levee]], David Novros, [[Robert Mangold]], [[Gary Stephan]], Paul Mogenson, [[Clark Murray]], and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the shaped canvas during the period beginning in the early 1960s. [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[hard-edge]] painters may, for example, elect to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. There is a connection here with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacts against the [[abstract expressionist]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as their solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting.
While the shaped canvas first challenged the formalized rectangular shape of paintings, it soon questioned the constraints of two-dimensionality. According to [[Donald Judd]] in his ''Complete Writings'': 'The main thing wrong with painting is that it is a rectangular plane placed flat against the wall. A rectangle is a shape itself: it is obviously the whole shape; it determines and limits the arrangement of whatever is on or in it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Judd|first1=Donald|title=Complete Writings 1959–1975|date=1975|publisher=Halifax: Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design|pages=181-182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the Solomun R. [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] organised the definitive exhibition 'The Shaped Canvas" curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]]. [[Lucy Lippard]] noted that this show focused exclusively on paintings with a "one -sided continuous surface"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=James|title=Minimalism: Art and Polemics in the Sixties|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10590-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3EYlwvRzvwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Frank Stella]] and Frank Geldzahler confronted this definition of the shaped canvas by introducing three-dimensional shaped canvases by artists [[Charles Hinman]] and [[Will Insley]] in their seminal group show "Shape and Structure" at Tibor de Naguy in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, Meyer&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the third dimension by paintings was an important development of the shaped canvas as it questioned the frontier between painting and sculpture.

The apertured, superimposed, multiple canvases of [[Jane Frank]] in the 1960s and 1970s are a special case: while generally flat and rectangular, they are rendered sculptural by the presence of large, irregularly shaped holes in the forward canvas or canvases, through which one or more additional painted canvases can be seen. A student of [[Hans Hofmann]], and sharing his concern for pictorial depth as well as his reverence for nature, she also favors colors, textures, and shapes that are complex, nuanced, and organic or earthen – giving her work a brooding or introspective quality that further sets it apart from that of many other shaped-canvas painters.

In the late 1960s, [[Trevor Bell (artist)|Trevor Bell]], a leading member of the British [[St. Ives group]] introduced dynamic shaped-canvas paintings that combined radical, angular structures with an [[abstract expressionist]] sensibility. These works continued to evolve into the 1970s as Bell's works were exhibited in the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]] and The [[Tate]] Gallery in [[London]]. The artist’s highly chromatic, [[color field]] surfaces on massive canvases merged shaped painting and the subsequent blank space surrounding the object into a state of equal importance. The Italian artist [[Luigi Malice]]&lt;ref&gt;Barbera, Lucio, ''[[:it:Luigi Malice|Luigi Malice]]: Percorsi della memoria 1959–1999'', Roma: Gangemi Editore, 1999 {{ISBN|88-7448-906-4}} [http://www.gangemieditore.com/scheda_articolo.php?id_prodotto=2914&amp;id_autore=1011]&lt;/ref&gt; also experimented with shaped canvases in the late 1960s.

[[Pop art]]ists such as [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[James Rosenquist]] also took up the shaped canvas medium. Robin Landa writes that "Wesselmann uses the shape of the container [by which Landa means the canvas] to express the organic quality of smoke" in his "smoker" paintings.&lt;ref name="Landa"&gt;Landa, Robin. ''An Introduction to Design'', Inglewood: Prentis Hall, 1983 {{ISBN|0-13-480624-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Colpitt, however, the use of the shaped canvas by 1960s pop artists was considered at the time to be something other than shaped canvas painting properly speaking: "At the same time, not all reliefs qualified as shaped canvases, which, as an ideological pursuit in the sixties, tended to exclude Pop art." (op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;52)

== More recent shaped canvas art ==
Among shaped-canvas artists of more recent generations, [[Elizabeth Murray (born 1940)|Elizabeth Murray]] (1940–2007) produced playfully "exploding" canvases, in which exuberance of shape and color seems to force itself outside the normative rectangle – or, as a 1981 ''New York Times'' review put it: "...the inner shapes blast off from their moorings and cause the whole painting to fly apart." &lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E1DB1738F93BA35756C0A967948260  NY Times review: "Art: Exploding Canvases of Elizabeth Murray"], May 8, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore's [[Anthony Poon]] (1945–2006) continued the tradition of cool, abstract, minimalist geometry associated with the shaped canvas in the 1960s. The analytical poise and undulating repetitions in his work somewhat recall the work of [[modular constructivist]] sculptors such as [[Erwin Hauer]] and [[Norman Carlberg]].

The Filipino artist [[Pacita Abad]] (1946–2004) stuffed and stitched her painted canvases for a three-dimensional effect, combining this technique (which she called ''[[trapunto]]'', after a kind of [[quilt]]ing technique) with free-wheeling [[mixed media]] effects, riotous color, and abstract patterning suggestive of festive homemade textiles, or of party trappings such as streamers, balloons, or confetti. The total effect is joyously extrovert and warm – quite opposed to both the minimalist and pop art versions of "cool".

In reference to the shaped paintings of [[Jack Reilly (artist)|Jack Reilly]] (born 1950), Robin Landa emphasizes the power of the shaped canvas to create a sensation of movement: "Many contemporary artists feel that the arena of painting can be greatly extended by the use of shaped canvases. Movement is established in the container (canvas) itself as well as in the internal space of the container."&lt;ref name="Landa" /&gt; A 1981 review in ''Artweek'' stated "These intricately constructed pieces are related to wall sculpture, bridging the gap between painting and sculpture, they have an illusionary sculptural presence."&lt;ref name="Artweek"&gt;Jaconson, Linda. ''Two Dimensional Reliefs'', Artweek, Vol.12, Nov 21, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional function of the shaped canvas in Reilly's earlier work was to emphasize the ambiguity of pictorial space in [[abstract art]].

The Argentine artist Ladislao Pablo Győri (born 1963) became interested in non-representative and rigorous geometry formulations in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lpgyori.net/ lpgyori.net Győri's ''digital works, art and poetry, 1984/2003, Madí Paintings-Relief'']&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the paintings of the aforementioned Rhod Rothfuss led him to work in the realization of Madí Turning Paintings-Relief (irregular frame) and 3D digital animations of those geometric structures. [[Gyula Kosice]] (sculptor, poet, theorist, and one of the founders of the Argentine avant-garde of the 1940s) wrote: "He has rationally computerized the primordial ideas of Madi Art... I am convinced that his works radiate an undeniable quality and originality."&lt;ref name="f25vy"&gt;Győri, Ladislao Pablo. ''First 25 Visual Years'', ARTgentina, 2010, p. 29, {{ISBN|978-987-05-8040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-rectangular paintings==
Artists have often departed from the norm, especially in circumstances requiring special commissions, an example being the paintings [[Henri Matisse]] created for [[Albert C. Barnes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/jholt/archives/001911.html Barnes mural] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720033955/http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/jholt/archives/001911.html |date=2011-07-20 }}. Accessed August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Nelson Rockefeller]].

In certain instances shaped canvas paintings can be seen as painting in relationship to sculpture and to wall relief. During the early to mid-1960s many young painters born in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s made the transition from painting flat rectangles to painting shaped canvases; some of those artists decided to make sculpture and some artists like [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Frank Stella]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]] did both. Other materials can be used in place of canvas. More viable materials might obviate some of the drawbacks of shaped canvas.

'''Texture gradient''' is the [[distortion]] in size which closer objects have compared to objects farther away. It also involves groups of objects appearing denser as they move farther away. Also could be explained by noticing a certain amount of [[Complexity|detail]] depending on how close something is, giving a sense of [[depth perception]].
There are three main forms of texture gradient: [[density]], [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], and [[distortion (optics)|distortion]] of [[wikt:texture|texture]] elements.

Texture gradient is carefully used in the painting ''[[Paris Street, Rainy Day]]'' by [[Gustave Caillebotte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psych.hanover.edu/krantz/art/texture.html "Vision and Art: Texture Gradient"], John H. Krantz, Ph.D., [[Hanover College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Honest Woodcutter''', also known as '''Mercury and the Woodman''' and '''The Golden Axe''', is one of [[Aesop's Fables]], numbered 173 in the [[Perry Index]]. It serves as a cautionary tale on the need for cultivating honesty, even at the price of self-interest.

The Greek version of the story tells of a woodcutter who accidentally dropped his axe into a river and, because this was his only means of livelihood, sat down and wept. Taking pity on him, the god [[Hermes]] (also known as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) dived into the water and returned with a golden axe. "Was this what you had lost?", Hermes asked, but the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver axe was brought to the surface. Only when his own tool is produced does he claim it. Impressed by his honesty, the god allows him to keep all three. Hearing of the man's good fortune, an envious neighbor threw his own axe into the river and wailed for its return. When Hermes appeared and offered him a golden axe, the man greedily claimed it but was denied both that and the return of his own axe.

Though the tale's moral is that 'Honesty is the best policy', as the English proverb has it, there existed a medieval Byzantine proverb apparently alluding to the fable, which stated that 'A river does not always bring axes'. But since this was glossed to mean that no person always acts consistently, it is obviously at a considerable remove from the story's application.&lt;ref name="Hansen2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. Hansen|title=Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=2013-04-14|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-3670-2|page=44|chapter=Hermes and the Woodcutter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of ideas that led to this understanding of the fable also exposes the gap in the envious neighbor's logic. He had observed the [[proximate and ultimate causation|proximate cause]] for enrichment, namely dropping an axe in the river, and overlooked the ultimate cause - the need for scrupulous honesty. The right combination of circumstances had to be there for Hermes to act as he did. Without them, as the neighbor eventually learned, 'the river does not always bring (golden) axes'. 

A burlesque retelling of the fable occurs in [[François Rabelais]]'s 16th-century novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''. It takes up most of the author's prologue to the 4th Book and is considerably extended in his typically prolix and circuitous style. The woodcutter's cries disturb the chief of the gods as he deliberates the world's business and he sends Mercury down with instructions to test the man with the three axes and cut off his head if he chooses wrongly. Although he survives the test and returns a rich man, the entire countryside decides to follow his example and gets decapitated. So, Rabelais concludes, it is better to be moderate in our desires. Much the same story is told in [[La Fontaine's Fables]] (V.1) but in more concentrated form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/19785 |title=An English version |publisher=Readbookonline.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than beheading the woodman's imitators, Mercury merely administers a heavy blow.

==The fable in the arts==
Some paintings named from the fable have been broad landscapes with small figures added in the middle plane. [[Salvator Rosa]]'s ''Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman'' in the [[National Gallery]], London, dates from about 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/salvator-rosa-landscape-with-mercury-and-the-dishonest-woodman |title=Salvator Rosa &amp;#124; Landscape with Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman &amp;#124; NG84 &amp;#124; The National Gallery, London |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 18th-century watercolour by George Robertson (1748–88) seems to derive from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icollector.com/George-Robertson-1748-1788-watercolour-Mercury-and-The-Woodman-9-5-x-15-5-ins_i5078639 |title=George Robertson (1748-1788) watercolour, Mercury and The Woodman, 9.5 x 15.5 ins |publisher=Icollector.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles-André van Loo]] gives greater prominence to the figures in his ''Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron'' in the [[Hôtel de Soubise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000063203.html |title=Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron |publisher=Insecula.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025055023/http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000063203.html |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this the god hovers in mid-air and presents the axes to the surprised and kneeling woodman. 

Illustrations of the fable on English chinaware draw on the woodcut in [[Samuel Croxall]]'s edition of Aesop. A Wedgwood plate of about 1775 displays a red picture in a square, garlanded frame. The rim has a wavy edge printed with detached sprays of flowers. Much the same picture as there, printed in green, is used on a contemporary Liverpool tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=&amp;q=mercury+and+the+woodman&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch= |title=Both are on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the left foreground, Mercury is presenting an axe to the seated woodman. In the distance, on the opposite bank, his dishonest neighbour has raised his axe before throwing it into the river. 

In 1987 the story was included on the 40 drachma value of the eight-stamp set of Aesop's fables issued by Greece and features the naked god seated on a rock in the river and offering the three axes to the bearded woodman on the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.creighton.edu/aesop/artifacts/stamps/greece Creighton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
The appearance of other tellings of the story, with local variations, from [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tcdZB_qga58C&amp;q=honesty+and+dishonesty#v=snippet&amp;q=honesty%20and%20dishonesty&amp;f=false|last=Aare |first=Emmanuel |title=African Tales|chapter=Honesty and Dishonesty|page=18 |isbn=978-1-60808-000-7 |publisher=WriteLife LLC |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raupectOnCkC&amp;q=honest+woodcutter#v=snippet&amp;q=honest%20woodcutter&amp;f=false|isbn=1-56308-096-6 |chapter=The Honest Woodcutter |title=Thai Tales |first1=Supaporn |last1=Vathanaprida |first2=Margaret |last2=MacDonald |first3=Boonsong |last3=Rohitasuke |page=42 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |date=1994 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tibet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3jVISrJayEC&amp;q=golden+axe#v=snippet&amp;q=golden%20axe&amp;f=false|title=Essentials of modern literary Tibetan: a reading course and reference grammar |last1=Goldstein|first1=Melvin|last2=Rimpoche|first2=Gelek|last3=Phuntshog|first3=Lobsang|chapter=The Golden Axe|page=208|isbn=0-520-07622-2 |publisher=University of California Press |date=7 August 1991 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; seems to call in question the purely Greek origin of the story. The Thai account claims to originate from a Buddhist [[Jataka]] tale but gives no source for a comparison to be made. Since the main lines of the story in all three are the same as in Aesopic versions, one might infer that, whatever their original form, they have since been influenced by the European model. 

A certain kinship has also been observed between the fable and the account of the miraculous recovery of an axe from a river in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]]. There the prophet [[Elisha]] was travelling with some members of a religious community 'and when they came to the Jordan, they began cutting down trees; but it chanced that as one man was felling a trunk, the head of his axe flew off into the water. "Oh master," he exclaimed, "it was a borrowed one." "Where did it fall?" asked the man of God. When he was shown the place, he cut off a piece of wood and threw it in and made the iron float.' (NEB, Kings II, 6.4-6)

'''The Law of Conservation of Misery''' is a [[folk wisdom]] that states that the total amount of [[wikt:misery|misery]] in a system is constant.

This implies that when you try to decrease the misery in one aspect of a system, you will increase the misery in some of the other aspects. In other words, for each problem you solve, at least one new problem is created, or as many new problems that together equal the trouble caused by the original problem. This law has particular significance in the realm of fantasy football, where one person's misery appears to correlate inversely with another person's happiness.  &lt;ref&gt;Dealing with Dilemmas, [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2010, Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0470630310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertzfeld|first=Andy|title=Revolution in the valley|year=2005|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastapol, Calif.|isbn=0-596-00719-1|pages=88|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tradigital art''' is [[art]] (including [[animation]]) that combines both traditional and computer-based techniques to create an image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/tradigital.asp WordSpy entry] for ''tradigital''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Unique.jpg|right|thumb|Unique Editions&lt;br&gt;top, left to right: [[Bonny Lhotka]], Judith Moncrieff;&lt;br&gt;bottom, left to right: Dorothy Krause, Karin Schminke, Helen Golden]]
Artist and teacher [[Judith Moncrieff]] first coined the term. In the early 1990s, while an instructor at the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]], Moncrieff invented and taught a new digital medium called "Tradigital". The school held a competition between Moncrieff's students, who used the medium to electronically combine everything from photographs of costumes to stills from videotapes of performing dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Gragg, "Art students get a crack at 'Nutcracker'," ''Portland Oregonian'', October 25, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"&gt;Lisa Wray, [http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm ''Judith Montcrieff, Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713212916/http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm |date=2011-07-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moncrieff also referred to her business entity (formerly "Moncrieff Studios") as "Tradigital Imaging" around the same period.

Moncrieff was one of five founding members of the digital art collective called "Unique Editions". These five artists—Helen Golden, [[Bonny Lhotka]], Dorothy Krause,&lt;ref&gt;William Zimmer, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E5DD1339F93BA25751C0A960958260 "ART;A Family and Its Gallery Click on the Future"], ''The New York Times'', February 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Moncrieff, and Karin Schminke—combined their expertise in traditional studio media and techniques with [[digital imaging]] to produce original fine art and editions. The artists met in June, 1994, at "Beyond the Digital Print", a workshop organized by Krause at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston. The artists' varied backgrounds are evident in their mixed media approach to using the computer as an art-making tool. Although every image is conceived and executed at least in part on the computer, the range of work includes one of a kind paintings, collages, Polaroid and image transfers, monotypes and prints on such varied substrates as canvas, handmade paper, and embossed metal. Moncrieff used the term "Tradigital media" to describe this merging of traditional and digital tools and "tradigitalism" as a name for this emerging movement. Unique Editions also served as a research and public relations entity for exploring technologies and promoting digital art. The group forged links with hardware and software developers in an effort to provide feedback on their products from the artist's perspective. It served as a demonstration to the rest of the art world of the role of digital technologies in the artist's studio. Unique Editions became inactive in 1997; however, Golden and Moncrieff continued to work together under the name, "Tradigital Fine Art".&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"/&gt;

Independently in the early 1990s, artist [[Lisa Wray]] was developing the fine art style she calls "Renaissance of Metaphysical Imagery". Prototypes were made for each work from color copies, color photos or film negatives made in her graphic arts darkroom. In 1990, she visited the only two places in the country with proprietary computer systems capable of assembling her prototypes: Raphael Digital Transparencies in Houston Texas, and Dodge Color Laboratories in Washington D.C. The first two prototypes, Brew of Life and Fantasy, were assembled by Dodge Color Laboratories on a Superset machine that was first developed by the Department of Defense. The final art was archived on 1" magnetic tape, and then output as an 11x14” color film transparency. Lisa discovered Judith Montcrieff and her pioneering efforts with Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art, in the early 1990s, found the term, "Tradigital", and also used the term to describe her own work.&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"/&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
Since then, use of the term has greatly expanded to include other art forms.

In 2002, "tradigital" went mainstream when [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] used the term '''tradigital animation''' to refer to the blending of computer animation with classical [[cell animation]] techniques, "a seamless blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation techniques".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Doherty, [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=106FA0A1A27D07B8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "Sense and Cinematography"], ''The Boston Globe'', Dec 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned as examples such animation films as ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', and ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kehr, [http://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9A04E6DE1F38F937A15756C0A9649C8B63 "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"], ''The New York Times'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Canemaker, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DC1430F931A25756C0A9649C8B63 "SUMMER MOVIES; Flat Worlders Face the Horizon and See It's in 3-D"], ''The New York Times'', May 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Horwitz, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A2169-2002May23 Stallion vs. Iron Horse: A Galloping Good Tale], ''The Washington Post'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Leopold, [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/22/ca.s02.spirit.katzenberg/index.html "The 'Spirit' of a movie mogul"], ''CNN'', May 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Rehfeld, [https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article104216/Die_Zukunft_der_Maerchen.html "Die Zukunft der Märchen"], ''Die Welt'', Dec. 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Moore, "The 'Spirit' of Jeffrey Katzenberg," ''The Orlando Sentinel'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that [[Walt Disney]] (a [[traditional art]] animator) would approve of the changes in the way cartoons are made today. Animation World Magazine&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Edwards, [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue6.01/6.01pages/edwardstelevision.php3 "Tradigital Television: Digital Tools and Saturday Morning"], ''Animation World Magazine'', Issue 6.01, April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; describes '''tradigital television''', and the impact of tradigital animation on pre- and post-production processes for television shows.

'''Tradigital printing''' is an experimental approach to [[printmaking]] with contemporary technology. In one form of tradigital printing, printmakers use computers to generate positives for UV photo transfer to plates and screens. In another form, digital print output incorporating [[silkscreen]], relief or [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques is the focus. For example, the Josephine Press&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Press, [http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html ''Tradigital Printmaking''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630045035/http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html |date=2008-06-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; uses a process that combines the use of archival digital prints with traditional techniques such as intaglio, [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and all of the other traditional printmaking methods. The process allows the artist to create a multi-color image without using a four-plate process. In addition to more efficient registration, the artist can work with collage and other mixed media works that can be scanned and reproduced in an archival manner. Tradigital printing greatly expands the possibilities of image-making while still producing an original hand pulled, limited edition, fine art print.

A recent Wall Street Journal article hailed '''tradigital creatives''' as the "voice of tomorrow",&lt;ref&gt;Manish Sinha, [http://www.livemint.com/2008/08/14151616/Web-Exclusive--Creativity-in.html "Creativity in tradigital times"], The Wall Street Journal, Aug 14 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting them with both "traditionalists" and "digitalists", and identifying several distinguishing characteristics of the new art/marketing medium: voices not eyeballs; experience not messages; community not communication; utility and solutions not cleverness; collaborative not silo thinkers.

A '''vernacular''', or '''vernacular language''', is the [[language]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a language used in everyday life by the common people of a specific population. It is distinguished from a [[standard language|standard]], [[National language|national]] or [[Literary language|literary]] language or a ''[[lingua franca]]'', used to facilitate communication across a large area. It is usually [[Native language|native]], mostly [[Spoken language|spoken]] rather than written and usually [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|seen as of lower status]] than more standardized forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8L-SDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT559&amp;dq=vernacular+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV1Ly707jbAhVpLcAKHZmuA4IQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vernacular%20language&amp;f=false|title=The Study of Language 6th Edition|last=Yule|first=George|date=2016-10-27|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316776780|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a language, [[dialect]] or [[sociolect]].

Some linguists use "vernacular" and "[[nonstandard dialect]]" as [[synonym]]s.&lt;ref name="Wolfram" /&gt;
[[File:ScanianLaw B74.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The oldest known vernacular manuscript in [[Scanian dialect|Scanian]] (Danish, c. 1250). It deals with Scanian and Scanian [[Ecclesiastical Law]].]]

== Etymology ==
Usage of the word "vernacular" is not recent. In 1688, James Howell wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning Italy, doubtless there were divers before the Latin did spread all over that Country; the [[Calabria|Calabrian]], and [[Apulia|Apulian]] spoke Greek, whereof some Relicks are [[Griko dialect|to be found to this day]]; but it was an adventitious, no Mother-Language to them: 'tis confess'd that [[Latium]] it self, and all the Territories about Rome, had the Latin for its maternal and common first '''vernacular''' Tongue; but [[Tuscany]] and [[Liguria]] had others quite discrepant, [[viz.]] the [[Etruscan language|Hetruscane]] and [[Messapian language|Mesapian]], whereof though there be some Records yet extant; yet there are none alive that can understand them: The [[Oscan language|Oscan]], the [[Sabine language|Sabin]] and Tusculan, are thought to be but Dialects to these.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The figurative meaning was broadened from the diminutive extended words ''vernaculus, vernacula''. [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], the classical Latin grammarian, used the term ''vocabula vernacula'', "termes de la langue nationale" or "vocabulary of the national language" as opposed to foreign words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=vernaculus |encyclopedia=Dictionnaire Illustré Latin Français |first=Felix |last=Gaffiot |publisher=Librairie Hachette |location=Paris |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts of the vernacular ==

===General linguistics===

====In contrast with lingua franca====

In [[Linguistics|general linguistics]], a vernacular is contrasted with a ''[[lingua franca]]'', a third-party language in which persons speaking different vernaculars not understood by each other may communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to sociolinguistics |first=Ronald |last=Wardhaugh |location=Malden, Mass.; Oxford |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |year=2006 |page=59 |quote=In 1953, UNESCO defined a lingua franca as 'a language which is used habitually by people whose mother tongues are different in order to facilitate communication between them.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Western Europe]] until the 17th century, most scholarly works had been written in [[Latin]], which was serving as a lingua franca. Works written in [[Romance language]]s are said to be in the vernacular. The ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'', the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'', and [[The Song of Roland]] are examples of early vernacular literature in Italian, Spanish, and French, respectively.

In Europe, Latin was used widely instead of vernacular languages in varying forms until c. 1701, in its latter stage as [[New Latin]].

In religion, [[Protestantism]] was a driving force in the use of the vernacular in Christian Europe, the [[Bible]] being translated from Latin into vernacular languages with such works as the Bible in Dutch: published in 1526 by [[Jacob van Liesvelt]]; Bible in French: published in 1528 by Jacques Lefevre d’Étaples (or Faber Stapulensis); German [[Luther Bible]] in 1534 ([[New Testament]] 1522); Bible in Spanish: published in Basel in 1569 by Casiodoro de Reina (Biblia del Oso); Bible in Czech: Bible of Kralice, printed between 1579 and 1593; Bible in English: [[King James Bible]], published in 1611; Bible in Slovene, published in 1584 by Jurij Dalmatin. In Catholicism, vernacular bibles were later provided, but Latin was used at [[Tridentine Mass]] until the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1965. Certain groups, notably [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s, continue to practice [[Latin Mass]].

In India, the 12th century [[Bhakti movement]] led to the translation of Sanskrit texts to the vernacular.

In science, an early user of the vernacular was [[Galileo]], writing in Italian c. 1600, though some of his works remained in Latin. A later example is [[Isaac Newton]], whose 1687 ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was in Latin, but whose 1704 ''[[Opticks]]'' was in English. Latin continues to be used in certain fields of science, notably [[binomial nomenclature]] in biology, while other fields such as mathematics use vernacular; see [[scientific nomenclature]] for details.

In diplomacy, French displaced Latin in Europe in the 1710s, due to the military power of [[Louis XIV of France]].

Certain languages have both a classical form and various vernacular forms, with two widely used examples being Arabic and Chinese: see [[Varieties of Arabic]] and [[Chinese language]]. In the 1920s, due to the [[May Fourth Movement]], [[Classical Chinese]] was replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]].

{{details|Vernacular literature}}

====As a low variant in diglossia====
The vernacular is also often contrasted with a [[liturgical language]], a specialized use of a former ''lingua franca''. For example, until the 1960s, [[Roman Rite]] Catholics held [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] in [[Latin]] rather than in vernaculars; to this day the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] holds [[liturgy|liturgies]] in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], not Arabic; the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] holds liturgies in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] though parts of Mass are read in [[Amharic]].

Similarly, in [[Hindu]] culture, traditionally religious or scholarly works were written in [[Sanskrit]] (long after its use as a spoken language) or in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in Tamil country. Sanskrit was a lingua franca among the non-Indo-European languages of the Indian subcontinent and became more of one as the spoken language, or [[prakrit]]s, began to diverge from it in different regions. With the rise of the [[bhakti movement]] from the 12th century onwards, religious works were created in the other languages: [[Hindi]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and many others. For example, the [[Ramayana]], one of Hinduism's sacred epics in Sanskrit, had vernacular versions such as ''[[Ranganadha Ramayanam]]'' composed in Telugu by [[Reddy dynasty|Gona Buddha Reddy]] in the 15th century; and ''[[Ramacharitamanasa]]'', a Hindi version of the Ramayana by the 16th-century poet [[Tulsidas]].

These circumstances are a contrast between a vernacular and language variant used by the same speakers. According to one school of linguistic thought, all such variants are examples of a linguistic phenomenon termed [[diglossia]] ("split tongue", on the model of the genetic anomaly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=diglossia |encyclopedia=Stedman's Medical Dictionary |year=1918 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In it, the language is bifurcated, i.e. the speaker learns two forms of the language and ordinarily uses one but under special circumstances the other. The one most frequently used is the low (L) variant, equivalent to the vernacular, while the special variant is the high (H). The concept was introduced to linguistics by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] (1959), but Ferguson explicitly excluded variants as divergent as dialects or different languages or as similar as styles or registers. H must not be a conversational form; Ferguson had in mind a literary language. For example, a lecture is delivered in a different variety than ordinary conversation. Ferguson's own example was classical and spoken Arabic, but the analogy between [[Vulgar Latin]] and [[Classical Latin]] is of the same type. Excluding the upper-class and lower-class register aspects of the two variants, Classical Latin was a literary language; the people spoke Vulgar Latin as a vernacular.

[[Joshua Fishman]] redefined the concept in 1964 to include everything Fergusen had excluded. Fishman allowed both different languages and dialects and also different styles and registers as the H variants. The essential contrast between them was that they be "functionally differentiated"; that is, H must be used for special purposes, such as a liturgical or sacred language. Fasold expanded the concept still further by proposing that multiple H exist in society from which the users can select for various purposes. The definition of an H is intermediate between Ferguson's and Fishman's. Realizing the inappropriateness of the term diglossia (only two) to his concept, he proposes the term broad diglossia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasold|1984|pp=34–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
Within [[sociolinguistics]], the term "vernacular" has been applied to several concepts. Context, therefore, is crucial to determining its intended sense.

====As an informal register====
In variation theory, pioneered by [[William Labov]], language is a large set of styles or [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] from which the speaker selects according to the social setting of the moment. The vernacular is "the least self-conscious style of people in a relaxed conversation", or "the most basic style"; that is, casual varieties used spontaneously rather than self-consciously, informal talk used in intimate situations. In other contexts the speaker does conscious work to select the appropriate variations. The one he can use without this effort is the first form of speech acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mesthrie|1999|pp=77–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a non-standard dialect====
In another theory, the vernacular is opposed to the standard. The non-standard varieties thus defined are dialects, which are to be identified as complexes of factors: "social class, region, ethnicity, situation, and so forth." Both the standard and the non-standard language have dialects, but in contrast to the standard, the non-standard have "socially disfavored" structures. The standard are primarily written (in traditional print media) but the non-standard are spoken. An example of a vernacular dialect is [[African American Vernacular English]].&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;{{cite book |title=American English: dialects and variation |first=Walt |last=Wolfram |first2=Natalie |last2=Schilling-Estes |pages=13–16 |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As an idealisation====
A vernacular is not a real language but is "an abstract set of norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lodge|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First vernacular grammar ==
Vernaculars acquired the status of [[official language]]s through [[Metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] publications. Between 1437 and 1586, the first [[grammar]] of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] were written, though not always immediately published. It is to be understood that the first vestiges of those languages preceded their standardization by up to several hundred years.

=== Dutch ===
In the 16th century, the "[[Chamber of rhetoric|rederijkerskamers]]", learned literary societies founded throughout [[Flanders]] and [[Holland]] from the 1420s onward, attempted to impose a Latin structure on Dutch, on the presumption that Latin grammar had a "universal character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noordegraaf|2000|p=894}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1559 [[John III van de Werve, Lord of Hovorst]] published his grammar ''Den schat der Duytsscher Talen'' in Dutch and so did [[Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert]] (''Eenen nieuwen ABC of Materi-boeck'') in 1564. The Latinizing tendency changed course with the joint publication in 1584 by De Eglantier, the rhetoric society of Amsterdam, of the first comprehensive Dutch grammar, ''Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst/ ófte Vant spellen ende eyghenscap des Nederduitschen taals''. [[Hendrick Laurenszoon Spieghel]] was a major contributor but others contributed as well.

=== English ===
{{details|History of English}}
[[Modern English]] is considered to have begun at a conventional date of about 1550, most notably at the end of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (for example, "bot", the footwear, more as in "boat" to "boot"){{clarify|date=April 2011}}. It was created by the infusion of [[Old French]] into [[Old English]] after the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066 AD and of Latin at the instigation of the clerical administration. While present-day English-speaking students may be able to read [[Middle English]] authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] with some schooling, [[Old English]] is much more difficult.

[[Middle English]] is known for its alternative spellings and pronunciations. The British Isles, although geographically limited, have always supported populations of widely variant dialects (as well as a few different languages). Being the language of a maritime power, English was of necessity formed from elements of many different languages. Standardization has been an ongoing issue. Even in the age of modern communications and mass media, according to one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Authority in language: investigating language prescription and standardisation |first=James |last=Milroy|first2=Lesley |last2=Milroy |page=29 |year=1985 |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "… although the Received Pronunciation of Standard English has been heard constantly on radio and then television for over 60 years, only 3 to 5% of the population of Britain actually speaks RP … new brands of English have been springing up even in recent times ...." What the vernacular would be in this case is a moot point: "… the standardisation of English has been in progress for many centuries."

Modern English came into being as the standard Middle English, i.e. as the preferred dialect of the monarch, court and administration. That dialect was East Midland, which had spread to [[London]] where the king resided and from which he ruled. It contained Danish forms not often used in the north or south, as the Danes had settled heavily in the midlands. Chaucer wrote in an early East Midland style, [[John Wycliffe]] translated the [[New Testament]] into it, and [[William Caxton]], the first English printer, wrote in it. Caxton is considered the first modern English author.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Champneys|1893|pp=269, 285–286, 301, 314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first printed book in England was Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', published by Caxton in 1476.

The first English grammars were written in [[Latin]], with some in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a general plea for mother-tongue education in England: ''The first part of the elementary'', published in 1582 by [[Richard Mulcaster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bullokar]] wrote the first English grammar to be written in English: ''Pamphlet for Grammar'', followed by ''Bref Grammar'', both in 1586. Previously he had written ''Booke at Large for the Amendment of Orthography for English Speech'' (1580) but his orthography was not generally accepted and was soon supplanted, and his grammar shared a similar fate. Other grammars in English followed rapidly: Paul Greaves' ''Grammatica Anglicana'', 1594; [[Alexander Hume]]'s ''Orthographie and Congruitie of the Britain Tongue'', 1617, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the succeeding decades many literary figures turned a hand to grammar in English: [[Alexander Gill]], [[Ben Jonson]], Joshua Poole, [[John Wallis]], Jeremiah Wharton, [[James Howell]], Thomas Lye, [[Christopher Cooper (grammarian)|Christopher Cooper]], [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily]], [[John Colet]] and so on, all leading to the massive dictionary of [[Samuel Johnson]].

=== French ===
{{details|Old French}}
French (as [[Old French]]) emerged as a [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] from [[Vulgar Latin]] during [[late antiquity]]. The written language is known from at least as early as the 9th century. That language contained many forms still identifiable as Latin. Interest in standardizing French began in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[Norman conquest of England]] and the Anglo-Norman domains in both northwestern France and Britain, English scholars retained an interest in the fate of French as well as of English. Some of the numerous 16th-century surviving grammars are:

* [[John Palsgrave]], ''L'esclarcissement de la langue francoyse'' (1530; in English).
* Louis Meigret, ''Tretté de la grammaire françoeze'' (1550).
* Robert Stephanus: ''Traicté de la grammaire françoise'' (1557).

=== German ===
{{details|History of German}}
The development of a standard German was impeded by political disunity and strong local traditions until the invention of printing made possible a "[[High German]]-based book language."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[literary language]] was not identical to any specific variety of German. The first grammar evolved from pedagogical works that also tried to create a uniform standard from the many regional dialects for various reasons. Religious leaders wished to create a sacred language for [[Protestantism]] that would be parallel to the use of Latin for the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Various administrations wished to create a civil service, or chancery, language that would be useful in more than one locality. And finally, nationalists wished to counter the spread of the French national language into German-speaking territories assisted by the efforts of the French Academy.

With so many linguists moving in the same direction a standard German (''hochdeutsche Schriftsprache'') did evolve without the assistance of a language academy. Its precise origin, the major constituents of its features, remains uncertainly known and debatable. Latin prevailed as a [[lingua franca]] until the 17th century, when grammarians began to debate the creation of an ideal language. Before 1550 as a conventional date "supraregional compromises" were used in printed works, such as the one published by Valentin Ickelsamer (''Ein Teutsche Grammatica'') 1534. Books published in one of these artificial variants began to increase in frequency replacing the Latin then in use. After 1550 the supraregional ideal broadened to a universal intent to create a national language from [[Early New High German]] by deliberately ignoring regional forms of speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Nils |last=Langer |contribution=On the Importance of Foreign Language Grammars for a History of Standard German |title=Standardization: studies from the Germanic languages |editor-first=Andrew Robert |editor-last=Linn |editor2-first=Nicola |editor2-last=McLelland |series=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 235 |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |year=2002 |pages=69–70 |location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; which practice was considered to be a form of purification parallel to the ideal of purifying religion in [[Protestantism]].

In 1617, the [[Fruitbearing Society]], a language club, was formed in [[Weimar]] in imitation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Italy. It was one of many such clubs; however, none became a national academy. In 1618–1619 Johannes Kromayer wrote the first all-German grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641 Justin Georg Schottel in ''teutsche Sprachkunst'' presented the standard language as an artificial one. By the time of his work of 1663, ''ausführliche Arbeit von der teutschen Haubt-Sprache'', the standard language was well established.

=== Irish ===
''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' is a grammar of the [[Irish language]] which is thought to date back as far as the 7th century: the earliest surviving manuscripts are 12th-century.

=== Italian ===
{{details|Italian language}}
Italian appears before standardization as the ''lingua Italica'' of [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] and the ''lingua vulgaris'' of subsequent medieval writers. Documents of mixed Latin and Italian are known from the 12th century, which appears to be the start of writing in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known grammar of a Romance language was a book written in manuscript form by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1437 and 1441 and entitled ''Grammatica della lingua toscana'', "Grammar of the Tuscan Language." In it Alberti sought to demonstrate that the vernacular – here Tuscan, known today as modern Italian – was every bit as structured as Latin. He did so by mapping vernacular structures onto Latin.

The book was never printed until 1908. It was not generally known, but it was known, as an inventory of the library of [[Lorenzo de'Medici]] lists it under the title ''Regule lingue florentine'' ("Rules of the Florentine language"). The only known manuscript copy, however, is included in the [[codex]], Reginense Latino 1370, located at Rome in the [[Vatican library]]. It is therefore called the ''Grammatichetta vaticana.''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=History of the Language Sciences / Histoire des sciences du langage / Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaften,  Part 1 |editor-first=Sylvain |editor-last=Auroux |editor2-first=E.

More influential perhaps were the 1516 ''Regole grammaticali della volgar lingua'' of Giovanni Francesco Fortunio and the 1525 ''Prose della vulgar lingua'' of [[Pietro Bembo]]. In those works the authors strove to establish a dialect that would qualify for becoming the Italian national language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occitan ===
The very first grammar in a vernacular language in western Europe was published in [[Toulouse]] in 1327. Known as the ''[[Leys d'amor]]'' and written by Guilhèm Molinièr, an [[advocate]] of Toulouse, it was published in order to codify the use of the [[Occitan]] language in poetry competitions organized by the company of the [[Acadèmia dels Jòcs Florals|Gai Saber]] in both grammar and rherotical ways.

=== Spanish ===
{{details|History of Spanish}}
Spanish (more accurately, ''la lengua castellana'') has a development chronologically similar to that of Italian: some vocabulary in Isidore of Seville, traces afterward, writing from about the 12th century, standardization beginning in the 15th century, coincident with the rise of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] as an international power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Spanish grammar by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] (''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana|Tratado de gramática sobre la lengua Castellana]]'', 1492) was divided into parts for native and nonnative speakers, pursuing a different purpose in each:  Books 1–4 describe the [[Spanish language]] grammatically in order to facilitate the study of Latin for its Spanish speaking readers. Book 5 contains a phonetical and morphological overview of Spanish for nonnative speakers.

=== Welsh ===
The ''Grammar Books of the Master-poets'' ({{lang-cy|Gramadegau'r Penceirddiaid}}) are considered to have been composed in the early fourteenth century, and are present in manuscripts from soon after. These tractates draw on the traditions of the Latin grammars of Donatus and Priscianus and also on the teaching of the professional Welsh poets. The tradition of grammars of the [[Welsh Language]] developed from these through the Middle Ages and to the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia |editor-first=John |editor-last=Koch |contribution=Gramadegau'r Penceirddiaid |first=R. Geraint |last=Gruffudd |location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |pages=843–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First vernacular dictionaries ==
A dictionary is to be distinguished from a [[glossary]]. Although numerous glossaries publishing vernacular words had long been in existence, such as the [[Etymologiae]] of [[Isidore of Seville]], which listed many Spanish words, the first vernacular [[dictionaries]] emerged together with vernacular grammars.

=== Dutch ===
Glossaries in Dutch began about 1470 AD leading eventually to two [[Dutch dictionaries]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brachin|1985|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christophe Plantin]]: ''Thesaurus Theutonicae Linguae'', 1573
* [[Cornelis Kiliaan]]: ''Dictionarium Teutonico-Latinum'', 1574 (becoming ''Etymologicum'' with the 1599 3rd edition)

Shortly after (1579) the [[Southern Netherlands]] came under the dominion of Spain, then of Austria (1713) and of France (1794). The [[Congress of Vienna]] created the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 from which southern Netherlands (being Catholic) seceded in 1830 to form the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], which was confirmed in 1839 by the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brachin|1985|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this political instability no standard Dutch was defined (even though much in demand and recommended as an ideal) until after [[World War II]]. Currently the [[Dutch Language Union]], an international treaty organization founded in 1980, supports a standard Dutch in the Netherlands, while [[Afrikaans]] is regulated by [[Die Taalkommissie]] founded in 1909.

=== English ===
[[Standard English]] remains a quasi-fictional ideal, despite the numerous private organizations publishing prescriptive rules for it. No language academy was ever established or espoused by any government past or present in the English-speaking world. In practice the British monarchy and its administrations established an ideal of what good English should be considered to be, and this in turn was based on the teachings of the major universities, such as [[Cambridge University]] and [[Oxford University]], which relied on the scholars whom they hired. There is a general but far from uniform consensus among the leading scholars about what should or should not be said in standard English, but for every rule examples from famous English writers can be found that break it. Uniformity of spoken English never existed and does not exist now, but usages do exist, which must be learnt by the speakers, and do not conform to prescriptive rules.

Usages have been documented not by prescriptive grammars, which on the whole are less comprehensible to the general public, but by comprehensive dictionaries, often termed unabridged, which attempt to list all usages of words and the phrases in which they occur as well as the date of first use and the etymology where possible. These typically require many volumes, and yet not more so than the unabridged dictionaries of many languages.

Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries precede modern English and were in use in the earliest written English. The first monolingual dictionary was&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|1999|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Cawdrey]]'s ''Table Alphabeticall'' (1604) which was followed by [[Edward Phillips]]'s ''A New World of English Words'' (1658) and [[Nathaniel Bailey]]'s ''[[An Universal Etymological English Dictionary]]'' (1721). These dictionaries whetted the interest of the English-speaking public in greater and more prescriptive dictionaries until [[Samuel Johnson]] published ''Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language'' (1747), which would imitate the dictionary being produced by the French Academy. He had no problem acquiring the funding, but not as a prescriptive dictionary. This was to be a grand comprehensive dictionary of all English words at any period, ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755).

By 1858, the need for an update resulted in the first planning for a new comprehensive dictionary to document standard English, a term coined at that time by the planning committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|1999|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary, known as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', published its first fascicle in 1884. It attracted significant contributions from some singular minds, such as [[William Chester Minor]], a former army surgeon who had become criminally insane and made most of his contributions while incarcerated. Whether the OED is the long-desired standard English Dictionary is debatable, but its authority is taken seriously by the entire English-speaking world. Its staff is currently working on a third edition.

=== French ===
Surviving dictionaries are a century earlier than their grammars. The [[Académie française]] founded in 1635 was given the obligation of producing a standard dictionary. Some early dictionaries are:
* Louis Cruse, alias Garbin: ''Dictionaire latin-françois'', 1487
* [[Robert Estienne]], alias Robertus Stephanus: ''Dictionnaire françois–latin'', 1539
* Maurice de la Porte: ''Epitheta'', 1571
* [[Jean Nicot]]: ''Thresor de la langue fracoyse, tant ancienne que moderne'', 1606
* Pierre Richelet: ''Dictionnaire françois contenant les mots et les choses'', 1680
* [[Académie française]]: ''[[Dictionnaire de l’Académie française]]'', 1694 ''annis''.

=== German ===
[[High German]] dictionaries began in the 16th century and were at first multi-lingual. They were preceded by glossaries of German words and phrases on various specialized topics. Finally interest in developing a vernacular German grew to the point where Maaler could publish a work called by [[Jacob Grimm]] "the first truly German dictionary",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|pp=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Maaler's ''Die Teutsche Spraach: Dictionarium Germanico-latinum novum'' (1561).

It was followed along similar lines by Georg Heinisch: ''Teütsche Sprache und Weißheit'' (1616). After numerous dictionaries and glossaries of a less-than-comprehensive nature came a [[thesaurus]] that attempted to include all German, Kaspar Stieler's ''Der Teutschen Sprache Stammbaum und Fortwachs oder Teutschen Sprachschatz'' (1691), and finally the first codification of written German,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Christoph Adelung]]'s ''Versuch eines vollständigen grammatisch-kritischen Wörterbuches Der Hochdeutschen Mundart'' (1774–1786).[[Schiller]] called Adelung an ''Orakel'' and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] is said to have nailed a copy to his desk.

=== Italian ===
In the early 15th century a number of glossaries appeared, such as that of Lucillo Minerbi on [[Boccaccio]] in 1535, and those of Fabrizio Luna on [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], [[Petrarch|Petrarca]], Boccaccio and [[Dante]] in 1536. In the mid-16th the dictionaries began, as listed below. In 1582 the first language academy was formed, called Accademia della Crusca, "bran academy", which sifted language like grain. Once formed, its publications were standard-setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance and reform: the Italian contribution|first=Frances Amelia |last=Yates| page=18|volume=Volume 2|year=1983|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54033">This '''list of the works of [[William Crooke]]''' (1848–1923) represents much of his literary output in pursuit of his interests in [[ethnology]] and [[folklore]], for which he was far many years considered to be a leading authority.

In addition to the items listed below in respect of ''Folk-lore Record'' and its successor, ''Folk-lore'', the journal of the [[Folklore Society]], Crooke also contributed frequently to that journal in the form of letters and brief observations. He was editor of the journal from 1915 until his death.&lt;ref name=Rose1923p383/&gt;

In addition to these works, Crooke made many contributions to the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics''.

He had been editing the ''Katha Sagara Kosa'', as translated by [[Charles Henry Tawney]], at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=Rose1923p383/&gt;
