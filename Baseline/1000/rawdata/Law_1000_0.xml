'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Access to information, just as [[media independence]] and pluralism remain critical issues in the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]].&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/article/moldova-stakeholder-submission-universal-periodic-review |title=Moldova: stakeholder Submission for the Universal Periodic Review |last= |first= |date=28 March 2016 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher= Freedom House|access-date=23 January 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous calls for media legislation reform, the government of Moldova has not made significant steps to improve access to information according to the country's international obligations, including a convention with the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref name=Jurnal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jurnal.md/en/politic/2016/10/14/access-to-information-more-and-more-difficult-in-moldova-things-that-are-in-fact-of-public-interest-are-excessively-and-abusively-kept-secret/  |title=Access to information, more and more difficult in Moldova; “Things that  are, in fact, of public interest are excessively and abusively kept secret” |last= |first= |date=14 October 2016 |website=Jurnal.md |publisher=Jurnal online |access-date=23 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public officials widely impede access to public information through refusals, delays or incomplete answers, without sanctions.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; In 2014, the [[Independent Journalism Center (IJC)]] presented to Parliament amendments to improve the law on access to information, provide additional guarantees for journalists and limit unjustified limitations of access to public information by public officials. However, the draft law has not yet been adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= November 2015 |title= Report on the State of Media in Eastern Partnership Countries |url= http://archive.eap-csf.eu/assets/files/Report%20on%20state%20of%20media%20in%20EaP%20countries_Nov%202015.pdf |publisher= Eastern Partnership. Civil Society Forum |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Executive Director of the [[Association of Independent Press]], Petru Macovei, overall the law on access to information is good, but it is compromised by a non-collaborative attitude of the public authorities.&lt;ref name=Jurnal/&gt;

==Legal framework==

The right to access public information in guaranteed by Article 34 of the Moldovan Constitution and is regulated by the Law on Access to Information which was adopted in 2000.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rti-rating.org/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/files/pdf/Moldova.pdf Republic of Moldova. The Law on Access Information. Retrieved 23 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The law establishes that information of public interest can be requested in writing or orally. Information can be consulted at the institution’s premises or can be received stored in an electronic support or in hardcopy.  Viewing documents on the institution’s premises is free of charge, while reasonable fees can be charged for the cost of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url= http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher= Balkan Investigative Report Network (BIRN) |access-date= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the law, documents of public interest must be provided within 15 working days, which can be extended by five days in case of requests of large numbers of documents.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; If the request is rejected, the applicant can exercise its right of appeal to the relevant courts, and if the court decides on behalf of the applicant, the law imposes penalties in form of fines to the government body which has violated the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; Exceptions justifying limitation to the disclosure regime are specified in the law and include state secrets, information on the military, intelligence, economic, foreign policy or criminal proceedings, information concerning ongoing lawsuit, personal data, confidential business data, and preliminary results of scientific and technical research.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to information in practice==

In practice, compliance with the Law on Access to Information remains weak just as its implementation which is not supported by the full authority of the bodies responsible for its enforcement. The [[Ombudsman]] in Moldova has the authority to supervise the implementation of the law, but this office lacks the capacity and the resources to exercise its role.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; Investigative journalists and civil society organisations face numerous difficulties when requesting access to public information, including obstruction by public officials, refusals and delays in replying to requests, as well as incomplete responses to requests for information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt; To justify their denials, public officials frequently cite laws that conflict with the Law on Access to Information, in particular the Law on State Secrets and the Law on Trade Secrets.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

One of the problem in enforcing the right to access public information is impunity, meaning that the law establishes only insignificant fines on public offices who fail to provide due access to information. Also, in many cases, the information provided by state bodies is shaped in the officials' favor, giving the impression that authorities are behaving in compliance with the law, while in fact depriving the requester the information they are seeking. Moreover, in many cases officials do not provide public interest information without the approval from a supervisor and often refuse to answers telephone calls from journalists, thus increasing the time for getting the required information.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

Another problem concerns the costs for obtaining public information and the fees charged to the requester, despite some improvements made recently, such as the introduction of a public register through the [[E-government|E-Government]] service in 2014. This affects in particular newsrooms and investigative journalists that must pay large sums of money for getting data useful for their investigative work.&lt;ref name=FH/&gt;

The warning reads:

{{quote|GOVERNMENT WARNING:

(2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate {{sic|hide=y|machinery, and}} may cause health problems.}}

The ABLA also contains a declaration of policy and purpose, which states that the [[United States Congress]] finds that

{{quote|the American public should be informed about the health hazards that may result from the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages, and has determined that it would be beneficial to provide a clear, nonconfusing reminder of such hazards, and that there is a need for national uniformity in such reminders in order to avoid the promulgation of incorrect or misleading information and to minimize burdens on interstate commerce.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">'''Ambulance chasing''', sometimes known as  '''[[Barratry (common law)|barratry]]''', is a professional slur which refers to a lawyer soliciting for clients at a disaster site. The term "ambulance chasing" comes from the stereotype of lawyers that follow ambulances to the emergency room to find clients.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Garner | first1 = Bryan A. | title = Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage | edition = 3 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-19-538420-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''ambulance chaser'' is also used more loosely as a derogatory term for a [[personal injury lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ambulance+chaser |title=Ambulance Chaser |publisher=The Free Dictionary |accessdate=2017-09-04 |quote=A lawyer who is eager to bring personal injury lawsuits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Ambulance chasing is prohibited in the United States. Such conduct violates Rule 7.3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_7_3.html Model Rules of Professional Conduct - Rule 7.3 Direct Contact With Prospective Clients - Center for Professional Responsibility&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].  Some [[bar associations]] strongly enforce rules against barratry.  For example, the [[State Bar of California]] dispatches investigators to large-scale disaster scenes to discourage ambulance chasers, and to catch any who attempt to solicit business from disaster victims at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy McCarthy, [http://archive.calbar.ca.gov/Archive.aspx?articleId=61497&amp;categoryId=61298&amp;month=3&amp;year=2005 "Public protection takes center stage in disaster"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811174430/http://archive.calbar.ca.gov/Archive.aspx?articleId=61497&amp;categoryId=61298&amp;month=3&amp;year=2005 |date=2011-08-11 }}, ''State Bar Journal'', March 2005, pages unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambulance chasing is also illegal in Australia, in accordance with clauses 20 and 22 of the Legal Profession Regulation of 1987.

In the UK, Indicative Behaviour (IB) 8.5 of the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] Code of Conduct 2011 specifies that "approaching people in the street, at ports of entry, in hospital or at the scene of an accident" is to be taken as an indication of non-compliance with the SRA Principles. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/handbook/code/content.page&lt;/ref&gt;

In English [[criminal law]], '''attainder''' or '''attinctura''' was the metaphorical "stain" or "corruption of blood" which arose from being condemned for a serious [[capital crime]] ([[felony]] or [[treason]]). It entailed losing not only one's life, property and [[hereditary titles]], but typically also the right to pass them on to one's [[heirs]]. Both men and women condemned of capital crimes could be attainted.

'''Attainder by confession''' resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges or before the [[coroner]] in [[sanctuary]]. '''Attainder by verdict''' resulted from [[Jury trial|conviction by jury]]. '''Attainder by process''' resulted from a legislative act [[outlaw]]ing a fugitive. The last form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in the United States), and the other forms have been [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|abolished]].

==Attainders of English noblemen and women in the Middle Ages and Renaissance==
[[File:Richard of York Talbot Shrewsbury Book.jpeg|thumb|[[Richard of York]], attainted by [[Margaret of Anjou]]]]
Medieval and Renaissance English monarchs used acts of attainder to deprive nobles of their lands and often their lives. Once attainted, the descendants of the noble could no longer inherit his lands or income. Attainder essentially amounted to the legal death of the attainted's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J. R. Landera1 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=52879FB5697304D27E716E4E892366E0.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3334696 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - Abstract |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monarchs typically used attainders against political enemies and those who posed potential threats to the king's position and security. The attainder eliminated any advantage the noble would have in a court of law; nobles were exempt from many of the techniques used to try [[commoners]], including [[torture]].  Likewise, in many cases of attainder, the king could coerce the parliament into approving the attainder and there would be a lower or non-existent burden of proof (evidence) than there would be in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/attainder.htm |title=Attainder, Being Attainted, Attainder Reversed - Luminarium Encyclopedia |publisher=Luminarium.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Tudors, most rulers reversed their attainders in return for promises of loyalty. For example, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] reversed all 21 attainders, [[Edward IV]] 86 of 120, and [[Richard III]] 99 of 100.&lt;ref name="sommerville"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20HVII%20policy.htm |title=Domestic and foreign policy of Henry VII |publisher=History.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053718/http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20HVII%20policy.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this changed with [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], as described below.

Regnants who used attainder include:
* [[Margaret of Anjou]]: her attainder of [[Richard of York]] compelled him to invade England and attempt to seize the throne after the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], which led to the penultimate phases of the [[War of the Roses]].
* [[Edward IV of England]]: used attainder after killing his brother, [[George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence]] for high treason.  This allowed [[Richard III of England]] to seize the throne when he claimed that Edward IV's sons were [[illegitimate]].  
* [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]: initially attainted men after he ascended the throne.&lt;ref name="sommerville"/&gt; He used the threat of attainder as a means to keep the few nobles who survived the [[War of the Roses]] in line. Often, however, he would penalize them with exorbitant fees and fines, or force them to have bonds which would be forfeit unless they exhibited good behaviour (his goal was to reduce the number of nobles with private armies of [[Bastard feudalism|retainers]].) Henry VII attainted 138 men, of whom he reversed only 46 attainders, and some of these were conditional.
* [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]: compelled parliament to attaint many nobles during his lifetime, including magnates with major land holdings, and any magnates whom he came to mistrust. Examples include:
** [[Anne Boleyn]]: Before her execution, she was stripped of her title, and her marriage was [[annulment|annulled]].
** [[Catherine Howard]]: Henry VIII had an Act of Attainder passed against Catherine Howard, which made it [[Royal Assent by Commission Act 1541|treason]] for a woman with an [[Virginity|unchaste]] reputation to marry the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Mahoney |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/tudor_4.htm |title=Kings and Queens of England - Henry VIII |publisher=English Monarchs |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward Stafford]], Duke of Buckingham, one of the wealthiest magnates in England, whom Henry had executed on flimsy charges in 1521.&lt;ref name="sommerville"/&gt;
** [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]]: One of the last surviving noble Plantagenets of senior line.
** [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]]: The poet son of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]].
* [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]: subsequent to the failed [[impeachment]] of his former [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], was attainted during the political crisis of 1640 -1641. The Bill of Attainder, having passed  the depleted [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]], was enacted by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] as a concession to his political opponents. During his reign, the [[Long Parliament]] of 1641 passed an Act of Attainder against [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] in 1645.

* [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]: Although deceased by the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Thomas Pride]] were served with a Bill of Attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]).

* [[William III of England|William III]]: 
** [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James, III and VIII, the Old Pretender]], 1702&lt;ref name="jamesiiiattainder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/p739 |title=William III, 1701: An Act for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High Treason |publisher=British History Online |date= |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George II of Great Britain]], following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]:
**[[Attainder of Earl of Kellie and others Act 1746]]

Once attainted, nobles were considered commoners, and as such, could be subjected to the same treatments, including [[torture]] and methods of [[execution]]. For example, commoners could be [[burned at the stake]], whereas nobles could not.

Often, nobles would refer to the act of being attainted (and then executed) as the person's "destruction".

==Passage in Parliament==
In the [[Westminster system]], a [[bill of attainder]] is a bill passed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to attaint persons who are accused of [[high treason]], or, in rare cases, a lesser crime.  A person attainted need not have been convicted of treason in a court of law; in fact, the attainder process is a method of declaring a person a [[fugitive]].

A rumour circulated that a bill of attainder against [[Thomas Jefferson]] occurred in 1774 because of his authorship of ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Meacham: ''Thomas Jefferson The Art of Power''&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill of attainder was last passed in Britain in 1798, against [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]]. Attainders by confession, verdict and process were abolished in the United Kingdom by the [[Forfeiture Act 1870]] (33 &amp; 34 Vict., c.23).

Section 9 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] provides that no bill of attainder or [[ex post facto law]] shall be passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 9, ¶ 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The following section forbids states from passing them.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 10, ¶ 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption of blood==
'''Corruption of blood''' is one of the consequences of attainder. The descendants of an attainted person could not inherit either from the attainted person (whose property had been forfeited by the attainder) or from their other relatives through him. For example, if a person is executed for a crime leaving innocent children, the property of the criminal is forfeited to the crown and will not pass to the children. If the criminal's innocent father subsequently dies, the property inherited by the criminal from the father cannot be inherited by the criminal's children either: it will be distributed among other family members.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

The [[United States Constitution]] prohibits corruption of blood as a punishment for treason.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 3, ¶ 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[England and Wales]] corruption of blood has been [[Corruption of Blood Act 1814|abolished]].

== Examples of cases where a person's property was subject to attainder ==

* [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]]
* [[John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln]]
* [[Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven]]
* [[Parker Wickham]]
* [[Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel]]
* [[Thomas Cromwell]]
* [[Earl of Perth]]
* [[Viscount Strathallan]]

The [[analogy]] typically includes reference to the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] head of [[government]] as [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84718-272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the analogy may also be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of [[Aesop's fable]] of "[[The Belly and the Members]]".

A later [[Europe]]an reference to the concept appears in ''The Book of the Body Politic'' (1407) by poet and court writer [[Christine de Pizan]], in which she admits having borrowed the concept from a letter of [[Plutarch]]'s to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] but does not mention [[John of Salisbury]]'s work, ''[[Policraticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] ''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.xviii-xx Kate Langdon Forhan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.3-5 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The metaphor appears in the French language as the ''corps-état''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Baecque|first1=Antoine|others=Trans.

The metaphor was elaborated in the [[Renaissance]], and subsequently, as medical knowledge based on [[Galen]] was challenged by thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were drawn between supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field, viewed as [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s or infections that might be remedied with [[purgative|purges]] and [[Patent medicine|nostrums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval origins==
{{Anchor|In statehood}} The term "Body politic" (the political body of [[society]]) derives from the mediæval political concept of the '''King's two bodies''' first noted by mediaeval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], as a point of theology as much as statehood. However, the person to give the concept some legal bite and codified reality, as much as legitimacy as well as Sovereignty, was the 14th century judge Sir [[William de Shareshull]] in 1351 for the offence of high treason&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration what Offences shall be adjudged Treason. Compassing the Death of the King, Queen, or their eldest Son; violating the Queen, or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or his eldest Son’s Wife; levying War; adhering to the King’s Enemies; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer, or Judges in Execution of their Duty.

ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before this Time in what Case Treason shall be said, and in what not; the King, at the Request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his [Queen or of their eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do violate the King’s Companion or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or the Wife  the King’s eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King’s Enemies in his Realm, giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere, and thereof be probably] attainted of open Deed by the People] of their Condition: . . . , and if a Man slea the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King’s Justices of the one Bench or the other, Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assise, and all other Justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their Places, doing their Offices: And it is to be understood, that in the Cases above rehearsed, that ought to be judged Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal Majesty" Treason Act 1351 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''1351 Treason''' Act 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[First Barons' War|Barons war]]. However, by the time of the fifteenth-century judge [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] the concept moves away from theology to [[jurisprudence]] in his ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy'', written from exile in about 1462 . Fortescue explains that the ''character angelus'' (divine character) of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body.  However, he uses the phrase ''body politic'' itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time, Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: "made a body pollitike callid a reawme." The early medieval period (13th century) saw a general and radical shift in the idea of the political body and sovereignty and who was to be ultimate ruler of humankind.This constant shift in [[Translatio imperii]] and ''The Halo of perpetuity''(Kantorowicz reasoning)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kings Two Bodies|last=Ernst|first=Kantorowicz|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; transformed the king's persona from [[Liturgy]] to legal science, argues Kantorowicz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The King's Two Bodies|last=Kantorowicz|first=|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] proved one thing, quite surprisingly enough, the king wasn't the ultimate and major landowner with just 20% of land ownership as [[William the Conqueror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doomsday Of Crown Lands|last=Sidney J|first=Madge|publisher=Routledge|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21|quote="Before the Norman conquest, therefore, it is possible to find a feudal edifice of at least four stages-first, the king as supreme lord;then the holders of "bocland"with their "courts", and the power of making separate grants; next the owners of "laenland", rendering military service and special dues;and lastly, the cultivators of the land (Feudal serfs) of two types, free and unfree.This division of the land before and after the (Norman) Conquest, worked out so carefully in 1867, but expressed in percentage form for the first time, reveals the curious fact that the Church(29.6%) alone gained by the Conquest, relatively speaking, the Crown(19.9%) and the Baronage(50.5%) showing proportionate losses in the new triangular balance of power."}}&lt;/ref&gt; found out to his disgust and chagrin, which ultimately led to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday book]] being compiled. With [[Plenitudo potestatis]], [[Unam sanctam]] (a [[Papal bull]]) [[extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] and the [[Sun and moon allegory]] now part of the armoury of jurisdictional power of the papacy with both [[Canon law]], and medieval political theology now becoming(part of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] movement beginning with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[John of Salisbury]]) a standard bearer for medieval political power which then descended into the infamous [[Inquisition]] and [[heresy]] (deviation from truth)as the ultimate legal reality which meant both the [[Roman catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Papal supremacy]] couldn't be ignored(not without fear of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] and in some cases judicial execution). The church, which ultimately had powerful claims to sovereignty due to their immense wealth and vast monetary resources which included a clever taxation system establishing the legal validity of the [[tithe]] system which baffled legal experts of the day of its historical lineage and origin, such as Sir [[William Blackstone]], for example, not its legal validity; such as their (the church's) enormous network and ownership of land, law making and the then-University and education system.

==Literal manifestation==
In 1550 the jurist [[Edmund Plowden]] merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the "Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantorowicz|first=Ernst H|authorlink=Ernst Kantorowicz|title=The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691071209|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609 [[Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke]] pronounced his dissenting opinion,  that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of both [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I]] with his now infamous judgements of [[Case of Proclamations]]&lt;ref&gt;'''England and Wales High Court (King's Bench Division)''' ''Decisions Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 November 1610''&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Petition of Right]]'', which triggered off the [[English Civil War]] and would have reverberations right across the country for the next 100 years. When the monarchy, in the person of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the idea remained current and royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] brought about the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz (1957: 423)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olwig (2002: 102)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century English [[Barrister]] and judge Sir [[William Blackstone]] developed further the medieval idea and the legal argument  (which still stands today) of the monarch in legal terms "immortal" with added emphasis of a quasi divine (''character angelus'') status.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] (1765) ''Commentaries On The Laws of England: In Four Books'' p.196 Volume 1 "But, fourthly; however the crown may be limited or transferred, it still retains its descendible quality, and becomes hereditary in the wearer of it. And hence in our law the king is said never to die, in his political capacity; though,in common with other men, he is subject to mortality in his natural: because immediately upon the natural death of Henry,William, or Edward, the king survives in his successor.
For the right of the crown vests, eo instanti, upon his heir; either the ''hares natus'', if the course of descent remains unimpeached,or the ''hares factus'', if the inheritance be under any particular settlement. So that there can be no interregnum (7); but,as [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (b) observes, the right of sovereignty is fully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown.And therefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolutely hereditary, unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined. 
In the same manner as landed estates,to continue our former comparison, are by the law here hereditary, or descendible to the heirs of the owner; but still there exists a power, by which the property of those lands may be transferred to another person. If this transfer be made simply and absolutely (8), the lands will be hereditary in the new owner, and descend to his heir-at-law; but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands must descend in that channel, so limited and prescribed,and no other". 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ancient legal maxim is that ‘the King never dies’. According to Blackstone,”the King survives in his successor” and “the right of the Crown ''vests, eo instanti'', upon his heirs”. Thus in legal theory the monarch is regarded as immortal and there is no moment in which the throne is vacant”. [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] Fifth Edition ''Crown and Crown Proceedings'' pp.8-9 Volume 29 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=John Anthony|title=James I and Divine Right|publisher=Sophia University|location=Tokyo|oclc=41418652|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Revolution monarchs of France also claimed legitimacy on this principle, and extended it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the "body politic" of the old king, in a physical "transfer of corporeality", on accession.&lt;ref&gt;de Baecque (1997: 100–102)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican Communion]] as a whole, unlike the [[Roman Catholic Church]], does not have a centralised [[canon law]] of its own.{{sfn|Skyes|Booty|1988|p=206}}  Each of the autonomous member churches of the communion, however, does have a canonical system.  Some, such as the [[Church of England]] have an ancient, highly developed [[Canon law (Church of England)|canon law]] while others, such as the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] have more recently developed canonical systems originally based on the English canon law.

'''''Corpus Juris Secundum''''' ('''''CJS''''') (Meaning, "Second Body of the Law")&lt;ref&gt;Legal Research and Writing for Paralegals, Published by Wolters Kluwer and written by Deborah E. Bouchoux&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[encyclopedia]] of [[Law of the United States|United States law]] at the federal and state levels. It is arranged alphabetically, into over 430 topics, which in turn are arranged into subheadings. {{as of|2010}}, ''CJS'' consisted of 164 bound volumes, 5 index volumes and 11 table of cases volumes.&lt;ref name="svengalis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Svengalis|first=Kendall F.|title=Legal Information Buyer's Guide &amp; Reference Manual|year=2010|publisher=Rhode Island LawPress|location=Westerly, Rhode Island|pages=89–90|chapter=Legal Encyclopedias|isbn=978-0-9767864-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''CJS'' is named after the 6th century ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]], the first [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[Roman law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. The name ''Corpus Juris'' literally means "body of the law"; ''Secundum'' denotes the second edition of the encyclopedia, which was originally issued as ''Corpus Juris'' by the American Law Book Company (from 1914 to 1937).&lt;ref name=svengalis /&gt; ''CJS'' is published by [[Thomson West|West]] in print form and on [[Westlaw]]. The print edition is updated annually with pocket supplements and revised editions of bound volumes. Before Thomson's acquisition of West, ''CJS'' competed against the ''[[American Jurisprudence]]'' legal encyclopedia.&lt;ref name=svengalis /&gt;

While legal encyclopedias like ''CJS'' were at one time heavily used by the courts, the growth of statutory and regulatory governance has had the effect of eroding this reliance. As such, rather than being used as sources of authoritative statements of law, legal encyclopedias are now more often used as tools for finding relevant case law.&lt;ref name=svengalis /&gt;

Volumes 82, 97, and 98 of ''Corpus Juris Secundum'' appeared behind the closing credits of the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' television series.

''CJS'' discusses more than 400 topics of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Research and Writing for Paralegals, Published by Wolters Kluwer and written by Deborah E. Bouchoux&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2607">'''Defeasibility''' is the property of something – such as a [[contract]], a [[proposition]] or an understanding – that can be [[annul]]led, [[Validity (logic)|invalidated]], or similarly "defeated". In [[law]], it refers to the possibility of a contract or other legal agreement being terminated by circumstances that arise later, or of legal reasoning being overturned. In [[philosophy]] – especially in [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], or the [[philosophy of law]] – it refers to the possibility of a particular principle, rule or understanding being overridden in appropriate circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=defeasibility |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |editor1-last=Bunnin |editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-first=Jiyuan |editor2-last=Yu |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell |doi=10.1111/b.9781405106795.2004.x |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g97814051067955_ss1-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pragmatics]], a subfield of [[linguistics]], it refers to the fact that certain kinds of implicitly conveyed information such as [[conversational implicature]]s and [[presupposition]]s can be "defeated" without sounding contradictory. For example, "[[Flag of Libya#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|This flag]] is green" normally implicates that it is ''completely'' green; but "[[Flag of Bangladesh|This flag]] is green. It contains a red disc" is no contradiction. Likewise, "John never stopped smoking" normally presupposes that he used to smoke (and still does), but you can say "John never stopped smoking because actually he never did smoke" without contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-22235-4 | last = Levinson | first = Stephen C. | title = Pragmatics | location = Cambridge | series = Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14131">'''[[Distributed ledger]] technology law''' ("'''DLT law'''") (also called '''[[Blockchain]] law'''.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Gatto, 'United States: Nevada Passes Pro-blockchain Law' (Mondaq, 23 June 2017) &lt;http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/604562/fin+tech/Nevada+Passes+Problockchain+Law&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Lex Cryptographia'''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Aaron Wright and Primavera De Filippi, 'Decentralized Blockchain Technology and the Rise of Lex Cryptographia' (2015) SSRN Electronic Journal &lt;http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2580664&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;) is not yet defined and recognized but an emerging field of law due to the recent dissemination of distributed ledger technology application in business and governance environment.

== Analogy with the [[Law of the Horse]] and [[Legal aspects of computing|Law of cyberspace]] debate ==

Ubiquitous dissemination of [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] led to a discussion of two opposite legal theories of the regulation of [[cyberspace]]. According to The [[Law of the Horse]] theory proposed by [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], general principles of law governing property, transactions and torts apply to any relationship whether in case of the horse or cyberspace and there is no reason to invent new fields of law designated for each.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Easterbrook, 'Cyberspace and the law of the horse' (1996) U Chi Legal F 207 &lt;https://www.law.upenn.edu/fac/pwagner/law619/f2001/week15/easterbrook.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was challenged by [[Lawrence Lessig]], who argued that in case of cyberspace the code may be considered as another way of regulation and therefore the cyberspace may be treated more widely than just another area of relations regulated by conventional legal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, 'The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach' (1999) 113 Harv L Rev 501 &lt;https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/finalhls.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Employing more liberal approach the DLT law may mean the body of law "characterized by a set of rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (and potentially autonomous) organizations".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Areas of law ==

As of the beginning of 2018 the DLT law does not constitute a separate field of law rather it encompasses aspects of corporate, contract, investment, banking and finance law. According to conservative approach the DLT law may be considered as a part of existent area of law, which may be applied to regulate different aspects of DLT use and new kind of legal relations on blockchain, such as issue of authorisation (electronic signature), admissibility of blockchain evidence in court, status of [[cryptocurrency]] and regulation of [[initial coin offering]], use of [[smart contract]]s, status of [[The DAO (organization)|DAO]] (decentralized autonomous organization) and other.

== Status of blockchain-based records and smart contracts ==

While in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/search|title=UK Find legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union|EU]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/european-union/law/find-legislation_en|title=EU Find legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of 2018 the legislators are still silent about blockchain technology, in the [[United States]] several states already enacted legislation providing a framework for business and legal application of blockchain technology and enforceability of smart contracts.

=== [[Vermont]] ===
On 2 June 2016 Vermont became the first state, which recognised blockchain-based records having legal bearing in a court under the Vermont Rules of Evidence and defined blockchain technology as "mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized consensus ledger or database, whether maintained via Internet interaction, peer-to-peer network, or otherwise"&lt;ref&gt;House Bill 868 &lt;https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2016/Docs/ACTS/ACT157/ACT157%20As%20Enacted.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Arizona]] ===
In March 2017, Arizona’s Electronic Transactions Act (the AETA) was amended by HB 2417 Act to clarify that “electronic records, electronic signatures, and smart contract terms secured through blockchain technology and governed under UCC Articles 2, 2A and 7 will be considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature under AETA.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Neuburger, 'Arizona Passes Groundbreaking Blockchain and Smart Contract Law – State Blockchain Laws on the Rise' (Proscauer, 20 April 20, 2017) &lt;https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2017/04/20/arizona-passes-groundbreaking-blockchain-and-smart-contract-law-state-blockchain-laws-on-the-rise/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; HB 2417 Act also provides a definition of blockchain technology as a “distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and definition of smart contract as "event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;House Bill 2417 &lt;https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2417/id/1588180/Arizona-2017-HB2417-Chaptered.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The State also identifies areas where blockchain technology should not be used. For instance, the new law adopted in 2017 prohibits the use of blockchain technology to locate or control firearms.&lt;ref&gt;Craig de Ridder, Mercedes Tunstall, Nathalie Prescott, 'Recognition of smart contracts in the United States' (2017) Intellectual Property and Technology Law Journal Vol 29 No 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House Bill 2216 &lt;https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2216/2017&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Nevada]] ===
In June 2017 similar legislation has been enacted in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Higgins, 'Nevada Senators Unanimously Advance Blockchain Tax Ban' (Coindesk, 26 April 2017) &lt;https://www.coindesk.com/nevada-senators-blockchain-tax-ban/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "Nevada has become the first state to ban local governments from taxing blockchain use".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Higgins, 'Nevada Becomes First US State to Ban Blockchain Taxes' (Coindesk, 06 June 2017) &lt;https://www.coindesk.com/nevada-first-us-state-ban-blockchain-taxes/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the definition of blockchain, the Nevada Senate defines it as "an electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information".&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill No 389 &lt;https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB398.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Delaware]] ===
On August 1, 2017, Delaware's blockchain law became effective, which amends the Delaware General Corporation Law explicitly permitting the use of distributed ledger technology in the administration of Delaware corporate records, including records of stock and stockholders.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Dodge, 'Delaware Authorizes Stocks on Blockchain' (Proskauer, 02 August 2017) &lt;https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2017/08/02/delaware-authorizes-stocks-on-blockchain/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill No. 60 &lt;https://legiscan.com/DE/text/SB69/id/1627743/Delaware-2017-SB69-Draft.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "Before this new law was adopted, there was nothing specifically stopping a Delaware corporation from using blockchain technology to keep track of its stockholders, but there was also a great deal of regulatory uncertainty."&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Dole and Doneld Shelkey 'Delaware Blockchain Law Goes into Effect' (Morgan Lewis, 11 August 2017) &lt;https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/sourcingatmorganlewis/2017/08/delaware-blockchain-law-goes-into-effect&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== DLT and law issues ==

=== Issue of [[Situs (law)|situs]] and place for [[dispute resolution]] ===
In the legal context DLT and smart contracts are distinct and face their own problems and challenges. Issue of situs is an example which relates to DLT rather than smart contracts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Linklaters and ISDA, ‘Smart Contracts and Distributed Ledger – A Legal Perspective’ (2017) &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.isda.org/a/6EKDE/smart-contracts-and-distributed-ledger-a-legal-perspective.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; International private law and legislation of various jurisdictions require to identify the location of an asset or place of an agreement in order to solve conflict of law problem and determine the applicable governing law. "However, the distribution of the register across nodes in multiple jurisdictions raises a seemingly intractable problem – under current legal principles at least – as to where the situs should be."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Holding something on DLT, including smart contract or title to an asset, does not isolate it from the legal system and laws of respective jurisdiction. "Some blockchain enthusiasts may have misinterpreted the statement ‘code is law’ as implying that code can supersede the law or that decentralised networks create their own legal regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Mik, ‘Smart contracts: terminology, technical limitations and real world complexity” (2017) Law Innovation and Technology Vol 9 No 2, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of a dispute between the parties of the smart contract within the DLT, the issue arises where the distributed ledger is located in order to determine the place for dispute resolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Reggie O'Shields, 'Smart Contracts: Legal Agreements for the Blockchain' (2017) North Carolina Banking Institute Vol 21, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; "Blockchain also poses questions concerning the ability to identify the parties to a transaction, to the extent a system utilizing this technology remains anonymous, which may rise a host of additional issues related to dispute resolution."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Issue of legal validity and update of code on DLT ===
An absence of legal [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] mechanism on DLT, [[Smart contract|self-executing]] nature of code on DLT and [[Blockchain|limited ability]] to update the code if the law changes create a number of legal issues. There are several  possible solutions of addressing these issues. "One method could be a system in which the relevant jurisdiction creates a publicly available database and [[Application Programming Interface (API)|application programming interface (API)]] of relevant legal provisions. These would be provisions related to the terms of the contract. The smart contract would call these terms and would be able to update those provisions terms in accord with the jurisdiction's update of the database."&lt;ref&gt;Max Raskin, ‘The Law and Legality of Smart Contracts’ (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

On more conservative side of DLT and law interaction spectrum are two solutions proposed by [https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/57906411 Alexander Savelyev]:

"(1) To introduce the concept of a ‘Superuser’ for government authorities, which will have a right to modify the content of Blockchain databases in accordance with a specified procedure in order to reflect the decisions of state authority.

(2) To enforce decisions of state authorities in ‘offline’ mode by pursuing the specific users and forcing them to include changes in Blockchain themselves as well as by using traditional tort claims, unjust enrichment claims, and specific performance claims."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Savelyev, 'Contract law 2.0: ‘Smart’ contracts as the beginning of the end of classic contract law' (2017)  Information &amp; Communications Technology Law Vol 26 No 2, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Issue of [[automation]] of smart contracts and 'Oracles'  ===
Subject to ability of distributed ledger to have access to terms and conditions by which performance of obligations under the smart contract must be assessed the execution of contracts on distributed ledger may be automated.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Thomas and Evan Schwartz, 'Smart Oracles: A Simple, Powerful Approach to Smart Contracts' (Github, 17 July 2014) &lt;https://github.com/codius/codius/wiki/Smart-Oracles:-A-Simple,-Powerful-Approach-to-Smart-Contracts&gt; accessed on 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the [[interest rate swap]] example, the distributed ledger must have access to assets of the parties' in order to fulfil the parties' payment obligations, and it must have access to a provider of interest rate information."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jenny Cieplak and Simon Leefatt, 'Smart contracts: A smart way to automate performance' (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 417.&lt;/ref&gt; The solutions to the issue of access to assets vary and may be solved through locking and release of assets in smart contract as it is performed through use of cryptocurrency Ether on [[Ethereum]] blockchain&lt;ref&gt;Vitalik Buterin, 'Ethereum: A Next-Generation Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Application Platform' (BitcoinMagazine, 23 January 2014) &lt;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-next-generation-cryptocurrency-decentralized-application-platform-1390528211/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; or by introducing new mechanism of access to assets like 'cash states' proposed by [[R3 (company)|Corda]] distributed ledger.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Hearn, 'Corda: A distributed ledger' (2016) &lt;https://docs.corda.net/_static/corda-technical-whitepaper.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the solution to the issue of access to information may require use of so-called 'Oracles' - an external parties providing the judgement to determine whether or not respective conditions under the agreement have been met.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; "Turning again to the interest rate swap example, an oracle could be used to provide interest rate information on a payment calculation date. The oracle's digital signature would be retained on the distributed ledger so that parties could review the payment process and confirm that payments were made correctly."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''European Judicial Network (EJN)''' is a network of contact points within the EU designed to facilitate judicial cooperation across borders.&lt;ref name="about EJN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/EJN_StaticPage.aspx?Bread=2|title=About EJN|publisher=European Judicial Network (EJN)|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/judicial-cooperation/european-network/index_en.htm|title=Criminal Justice: European Judicial Network|publisher=[[European Commission]]|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a focus on serious crime (such as organized crime, corruption, drug smuggling and terrorism), it helps form and maintain contacts between agencies in member states.&lt;ref name="poderjudicial.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Temas/Redes-Judiciales/Otras-redes-judiciales/Criminal-European-Judicial-Network|title=Criminal European Judicial Network|publisher=[[General Council of the Judiciary]] (Spain)|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Network was created by Joint Action 98/428 in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31998F0428|title=98/428/JHA: Joint Action of 29 June 1998|publisher=[[EUR-Lex]]|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fulfil recommendation no. 21 of the Action Plan to Combat Organised Crime adopted by the [[Council of the European Union]] on 28 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A51997XG0815|title=Action plan to combat organized crime (Adopted by the Council on 28 April 1997)|publisher=[[EUR-Lex]]|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A priority of the EJN is the dissemination of information to its citizens, judges and legal practitioners, primarily through its Web site. The EJN’s main functions are: Facilitating judicial cooperation among the Member States; travelling to meet the contact points of other State Members, as necessary; providing the local judicial authorities of their country with the necessary legal and practical information; providing the local judicial authorities of other member states the necessary legal and practical information; improving the coordination of the judicial cases. 

A member state’s Contact Point can identify relevant other Contact Points via the European Justice Atlas.&lt;ref name="poderjudicial.es"/&gt;

The secretariat of the EJN functions as an independent autonomous unit within the staff of [[Eurojust]], based in [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejn-crimjust.europa.eu/ejn/EJN_Secretariat.aspx|title=EJN Secretariat|publisher=European Judicial Network (EJN)|accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federal jurisdiction''' is the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[federal government]] in any country that uses [[federalism]]. Such a country is known as a [[Federation]].

==Federal jurisdiction by country==
All federations, by definition, must have some form of federal jurisdiction, this will commonly include powers relating to international relations and war. Though power for particular actions varies from one federation to another.

{{cns|date=December 2014|A '''formal contract''' is a [[contract]] where the parties have signed under seal, while an '''informal contract''' is one not under seal.  A seal can be any impression made upon the document by the parties to the contract. This was traditionally done in wax stating the intentions of the parties to be bound by the contract. Only parties to a sealed documents are the people who have rights under it, thus only people party to the contract can be found liable. According to Harvey Boller, J.D. Professor of Law at Loyola University, roughly 100 percent of contracts today are informal contracts.}}

{{cns|date=December 2014|The legitimacy of a contract, however, does not rely upon whether a contract is formal or informal.  Both are considered binding, given all other elements of a contract exist. In which both parties agree to each comply with each other's wishes to a certain limit. 
Usually the contract is formed by a greater authority, such a government, or corporation.}}

The Twelfth Edition of ''Business Law: Text Cases'' (Clarkson, Miller &amp; Cross), says that formal contracts are, "contracts that require a special form or method of creation to be enforceable." It uses negotiable instruments as an example of formal contracts, such as: checks, drafts, promissory notes, and certificates of deposit. These example are all required to have special formation under the Uniform Commercial Code.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, and Cross. "Chapter 11: Contract Law." Business Law: Text and Cases. By Clarkson. 12th ed. Mason: Cengage Learning, 2012. 210. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7011">'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly, of the [[British Empire]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]], the most influential of the [[Four Policemen]] victorious in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] may take over the role&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"&gt;[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as it reaches out to protect [[shipping lanes]], protect its overseas workers, and 'creeps into the superpower league'. The [[Western world|West]], according to two columnists of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', 'should view this as an opportunity, not a threat.'&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"/&gt;

==In international law==

No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; '[[par in parem non habet imperium]]', no authority between equals, is the principle applied. In reality, international law is decentralised, unpoliced, unenforceable, unclear and frequently broken. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with state policing==

Within states, law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13th July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The comparatively peaceful years 1815–1914 came to be known as [[Pax Britannica]]. The UK made efforts to control the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&gt;pdf&gt;britain-and-the-trade.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sebastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914–1945 no one state was hegemonic. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[The Daily Bell]], 19/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,&lt;/ref&gt; But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2554">The '''Hart–Fuller debate''' is an exchange between [[Lon Fuller]] and [[H. L. A. Hart]] published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1958 on morality and law, which demonstrated the divide between the [[Legal positivism|positivist]] and [[natural law]] philosophy. Hart took the positivist view in arguing that morality and law were separate. Fuller's reply argued for morality as the source of law's binding power.

==Philosophy==
Positivists believe in a separation between the law as it is and the law as it should be.  Legal rights and moral rights are not related, beyond mere coincidence. Hart believes the method of deciding cases through logic or deduction is not necessarily wrong, just as it is not necessarily right to decide cases according to social or moral aims.  Hart uses the problem of "the core and the penumbra" to illustrate the idea that laws must be related to the meaning of the words, not any natural or moral belief.  A "core" case would be one that the statute is intended to cover.  In the classic example, a statute that bans vehicles from a park is obviously intended to cover cars. A "penumbra" case would be one not considered by the creators of the law, such as a skateboard in the example above.  A judge interpreting such a law from a positivist viewpoint would look to a definition of the words in the statute. The natural law view believes that the creation of law should be based on natural laws or common morals

Board of Education, 05311955.gif|thumb|right|220px|The first page of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] judgement in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the "mother of all impact litigation".{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}]]
'''Impact litigation''' or '''strategic litigation''' is the practice of bringing [[lawsuit]]s intended to effect societal change.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}} Impact litigation cases may be [[class action]] lawsuits or individual claims with broader significance,{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} and may rely on [[statutory law]] arguments or on [[constitution]]al claims.{{sfn | Tushnet | 2008 | p=383}} Such litigation has been widely and successfully used to influence public policy, especially by [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] groups, and often attracts significant media attention.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}

==History==
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (at times though its [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Legal Defense Fund]]) both pursued legal action to advance and protect civil rights in the [[United States of America|United States]]. The ACLU followed a primarily "defensive" strategy, fighting individual violations of rights when they were identified. The NAACP, in contrast, developed a more coordinated plan to actively file suits to challenge discrimination, known as "affirmative" or "strategic" litigation.{{sfn |Tushnet |2008 |p=380}} The NAACP's model became the pattern for "impact litigation" strategies, which applied similar tactics in contexts other than racial discrimination.{{sfn|Tushnet |2008 |p=383}}

Important early impact litigation cases included ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} ''Brown'', a 1954 U.S. [[school desegregation]] decision, was carefully prepared by [[Thurgood Marshall]] and other NAACP lawyers so that the eventual [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling invalidated official racial discrimination throughout the U.S. government. Many cases since then have closely imitated it, in the course of seeking greater protections for other disadvantaged groups.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}

==Scope==
Impact litigation has played a major role in the development of American desegregation, [[abortion]],  [[Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |tobacco regulation]] policy{{sfn | Mason | Leavitt | Chaffee | 2013 | p=547}} and [[gay marriage]].  

Since the 1980s, impact litigation has been used to seek reform in the reform of U.S. [[Child protection|child welfare law]], following earlier work which involved the courts in jail and mental hospital reforms and in school desegregation.{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

Strategic impact litigation has also been used in [[Nigeria]], among other things to push for convictions of perpetrators of [[police brutality]] and to defeat legal attacks on the [[freedom of the press]].{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}}

In a few jurisdictions where attorneys are prohibited from bringing class action lawsuits, citizens have filed "grassroots impact litigation" cases and successfully represented their own claims.{{sfn |Freeman |1991 }}

==Debate==
Impact litigation has been criticized by legal scholars and politicians on the bases of judicial legitimacy and competence.

The legitimacy argument holds that, in countries with a constitutional [[separation of powers]], societal changes are to be enacted by democratically elected bodies and are outside the purview of individual judges. The competence argument claims that institutional limitations on the amount and quality of information that can be made available in a court proceeding make the courts poorly prepared to handle complex policy issues. Another version of this argument points out that courts are limited in the scope of their responses, relative to legislative bodies.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | pp=107-111}} These debates overlap with those concerning so-called "[[judicial activism]]".{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2691">'''Implied powers''', in the [[United States]], are powers authorized by the Constitution that, while not stated, seem implied by powers that are expressly stated. When [[George Washington]] asked [[Alexander Hamilton]] to defend the constitutionality of the [[First Bank of the United States]] against the protests&lt;ref&gt; they implied powers into the united states.......[http://courses.pasleybrothers.com/texts/Jefferson_on_BUS.htm Against the Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States], Thomas Jefferson.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and Attorney General [[Edmund Randolph]], Hamilton produced what has now become the classic statement for implied powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bank-ah.asp For the Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States], Alexander Hamilton.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends.  Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies.  Hamilton noted that the "[[Taxing and Spending Clause|general welfare clause]]" and the "[[Necessary_and_Proper_Clause|necessary and proper clause]]" gave elasticity to the Constitution. Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed the bank bill into law.

Later, directly borrowing from Hamilton, Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] invoked the implied powers of government in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]''. In 1816, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation creating the [[Second Bank of the United States]].  The state of Maryland attempted to tax the bank.  The state argued the [[United States Constitution]] did not explicitly grant Congress the power to establish banks.  In 1819, the Court decided against the state of Maryland. Chief Justice Marshall argued that Congress had the right to establish the bank, as the Constitution grants to Congress certain implied powers beyond those explicitly stated.

In the case of the United States Government, implied powers are powers Congress exercises that the Constitution does not explicitly define, but are necessary and proper to execute the powers.

==Notes==
Implied powers are those that can reasonably be assumed to flow from express powers, though not explicitly mentioned. The legitimacy of these powers is derived from the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]], the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]], and the [[Commerce Clause]].

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25858">The '''legal system of the [[United Arab Emirates]]''' is based on the [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution]] of the United Arab Emirates; this system is dual in nature as it has local and federal courts with a Supreme Court Based at Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalarbitrationreview.com/know-how/topics/73/jurisdictions/33/united-arab-emirates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Britain&lt;ref&gt;https://www.innertemple.org.uk/downloads/education/lectures/lecture_james_lee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries where previous court judgments are regularly used as legal precedents, the UAE does not depend that much on precedents, although sometimes the judgments of higher courts can be applied by lower courts in similar cases.

Where legislative provisions do not cover a specific issue, the court will make a decision in accordance with Sharia law. Islamic jurisprudence is widely used in the construction and interpretation of the UAE law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hadefpartners.com/News/115/SHARIA-AS-A-SOURCE-OF-UAE-LAW|title=Sharia as a source of UAE law|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hadefpartners.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Prior to the Union in 1971, the Trucial States were known as a protectorate of the British Empire established through a number of treaties. During that period, most disputes were handled by the rulers of the emirates, heads of local tribes, and unofficial judges following [[customary law]]. The primary source of law was Islam along with the unwritten social conventions or "[[Urf]]". Sharia judges specialized in family disputes whereas customary law judges handled criminal assaults and personal disputes. In the inland Bedouin communities, disputes usually related to livestock and water resources. Disputes in coastal cities were normally about trade and commercial relations, particularly related to the pearl trade.

After the 1853 truce, disputes pertaining to pearl diving were handled directly by the British [[Persian Gulf Residency|political resident]] in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Judicial System in The Trucial Coast|last=Al Falahi|first=Noora|publisher=Hamdan Bin Mohammed Heritage Centre|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UAE legal system in the constitution==

The United Arab Emirates’ [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution]], which came into effect on 2 December 1971, dedicates all its fifth Section for the Union legal system. Article 94 of the Constitution stipulates that “justice is the basis of authority”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_Arab_Emirates_2004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of UAE laws ==
The United Arab Emirates is essentially a civil law jurisdiction that depends in the first place on Roman, French, Egyptian laws . However, the main source of the Emirati law is the [[Sharia|Sharia law]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; International law is another source of Emirati law, in compliance with the UAE obligations signed in international conventions.

== Courts ==

===The Supreme Court===

Being the highest judicial instance in the UAE does not mean that it applies to the seven Emirates, Dubai and Ras Al Khayma have their own local judicial system. Article 96 of the UAE Constitution reads as follows “The Supreme Court of the Union shall consist of a President and a number of Judges, not exceeding five in all, who shall be appointed by decree, issued by the President of the Union after approval by the Supreme Council ”.

The constitution also divides courts in the country into two types, federal courts and local courts. The president and the members of the Supreme Court can by no means be removed from their offices, except in the following cases: Death, resignation, completion of term or secondment, retirement, permanent disability that prevent a judge from undertaking their duties, disciplinary discharge and finally “appointment to other offices, with their agreement”. Any court has it jurisdiction, the judgments of the Emirati Supreme Court cover matters like Miscellaneous disputes raising between the Member Emirates, law constitutionality, constitution interpretation, interrogation of senior officials of the Union like Ministers, crimes threatening affecting the interests of the Union. Article 101 of the Emirati Constitution stipulates that “The judgements of the Supreme Court of the Union shall be final and binding upon all.”

The first President of the Union Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates is H.E Judge Dr. Abdul Wahab Abdul (incumbent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejustice.gov.ae/portal/page/portal/eJustice%20MOJ%20Portal/SupremeCourt/Home|website=Union Supreme Court|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Courts===

As their names suggests, Federal Courts are competent to consider all cases arising within the UAE territory, like disputes, domiciliary, transactions, etc. "Furthermore, UAE courts have a kind of “emergency jurisdiction,” whereby a UAE court can determine preliminary applications for attachment of a defendant’s assets as well as urgent applications, even where the court would otherwise lack jurisdiction" . Cases are commenced in Federal Courts when the complaint is filed with the Reconciliation and Settlement Committee. “The relevant reconciliation committee will attempt reconciliation, and refer complaints to the court only after resolution efforts have failed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.attorneys.ae/news/uae-courts/|title=How the Federal and local court systems fit together, UAE Courts|newspaper=UAE Attorneys|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Courts===

Local courts (First Instance Court) in the UAE basically consider “cases, authentications and all urgent matters related to disputes among the people as well as the safeguard of their rights, security and safety. It also undertakes forcible judicial execution for execution deed stipulated by law, as well as executions by deputation or reference”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/portal/page?_pageid=292,447242&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=First Instance Court|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dubaicourts.gov.ae|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharia Courts

Sharia courts focus on civil disputes in which the parties are Muslims. They depend on the juristic provisions provided for in the Quran the Hadith to render decisions. “The Sharia court may, at the federal level only (which, as mentioned earlier, excludes Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah), also hear appeals of certain criminal cases including rape, robbery, driving under the influence of alcohol and related crimes, which were originally tried in lower criminal courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dubai.usconsulate.gov/emergency_uae_court.html|title=The UAE Court System|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Dubai, UAE - Consulate General of the United States|access-date=2016-11-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022020506/http://dubai.usconsulate.gov/emergency_uae_court.html|archivedate=2015-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil Courts

The jurisdiction of civil courts is generic as they can consider urgent cases and petitions of all types, including petitions of attachments, orders of payment and complaints. A civil Court also "deals with financial and corporeal rights and legal positions meant to protect by virtue of it, it does not includes commercial, realty, labor, personal status or endowment or inheritance cases".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/portal/page?_pageid=292,451192&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Civil Court|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dubaicourts.gov.ae|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common Law Courts ===

==== Dubai International Financial Center Courts (DIFC) ====
{{see also|DIFC Courts}}

The DIFC Courts are an independent English language [[common law]] judiciary, with jurisdiction governing civil and commercial disputes nationally, regionally and worldwide. The Courts began operations in 2006.

Originally, the jurisdiction of the DIFC Courts was limited to the geographical area of the [[Dubai International Financial Centre|DIFC]]. On October 2011, the signing of Dubai Law No 16.&lt;sup&gt;[[DIFC Courts|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; allowed the DIFC Courts to hear any local or international cases and to resolve commercial disputes with the consent of all parties.

==== Abu Dhabi Global Market Courts (ADGM) ====
Established in accordance with Abu Dhabi Law No (4) of 2013, [[Abu Dhabi Global Market|ADGM]] Courts are broadly modelled on the English judicial system. The common law of England, including the principles and rules of [[Equity (law)|Equity]], apply and form part of the law of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adgm.complinet.com/net_file_store/new_rulebooks/a/p/Application_of_English_Law_Regulations_2015.pdf|title=Application of English Law Regulations 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ADGM|access-date=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regulations for ADGM Courts were also drawn from Scots and Australian Federal law and have been tailored specifically to meet the requirements of ADGM Courts. The direct application of [[English law]] makes ADGM the first jurisdiction in the Middle East to adopt a similar approach to that of Singapore and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adgm.com/doing-business/adgm-courts/adgm-legal-framework/adgm-courts-legal-framework/|title=ADGM {{!}} ADGM Courts Legal Framework|website=www.adgm.com|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither [[Dubai International Financial Centre|DIFC]] nor [[Abu Dhabi Global Market|ADGM]] courts have jurisdiction in criminal matters.

== Dubai Court System &amp; Ras Al Khaimah Court System ==
[[Dubai]] and [[Ras al-Khaimah|Ras Al Khaimah]] have two independent legal systems. For instance, Dubai’s court system three stages: The Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Cassation. Generally speaking, Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah courts consider local disputes concerning property and domestic disputes. However, it can also enforce foreign judgments, arbitration awards, and awards from other tribunals such as the dispute resolution bodies within the [[List of Free Trade Zones in Dubai|Free Zones]] &amp; Special Economic Zones. The legal systems of the two emirates are different from one another at several levels, but there is at least one important similarity which that of being independent from the federal system, and from the authority of the federal Supreme Court [http://www.attorneys.ae/news/uae-courts/]

== The Dubai Rental Disputes Center (RDC) ==
Established pursuant to Local Decree No.26 of 2013, the RDC has almost exclusive jurisdiction to settle disputes arising between landlords and tenants in Dubai, as per Dubai Law No.26 of 2007 Regulating Relationship between Landlords and Tenants in the Emirate of Dubai.

==Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)==
There are various [[Alternative dispute resolution|Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)]] mechanisms available for individuals and business in the UAE.

=== Arbitration ===
[[Arbitration]] has long been recognized as a dispute resolution mechanism in the region, and one that has been quoted in Islamic religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamimi.com/en/magazine/law-update/section-7/august-september-1/finding-your-path-arbitration-sharia-and-the-modern-middle-east.html|title=Finding your path: Arbitration, Sharia, and the Modern Middle East - Al Tamimi &amp; Company|last=Company|first=Al Tamimi &amp;|website=www.tamimi.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been numerous initiatives in the UAE to build up a strong presence in international commercial arbitration, including the codification of modern arbitration rules in federal and other laws.

==== Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) ====
First created in 1994 as the "Centre for Commercial Conciliation and Arbitration", the current DIAC is non-profit institution located in [[Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry|the Dubai Chamber of Commerce]] &amp; Industry (DCCI).

==== The DIFC/LCIA Arbitration Centre ====
A joint venture between the [[Dubai International Financial Centre]] (DIFC) and the [[London Court of International Arbitration]] (LCIA). The arbitration rules for the Center are closely modeled on the LCIA’s own rules with some modifications.

==== The International Islamic Centre for Reconciliation and Arbitration (IICRA) ====
IICRA is an international, independent, non-profit organization supporting the Islamic finance industry. The center settles all financial and commercial disputes that arise between financial or business institutions that choose to apply the provisions of Islamic law, Sharia principles, in resolving disputes that arise between these institutions and their clients or between them and third parties through reconciliation or arbitration.

=== Mediation ===

==== Employment disputes ====
Under the UAE Federal Labor Law, all unresolved employment disputes must be lodged first at the Ministry of Labour office where a settlement is negotiated between employers and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mol.gov.ae/newmolgateway/english/newindex.aspx|title=Ministry of Labour|website=www.mol.gov.ae|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the negotiations fail, either party may take up the matter at court. Since there are no trade unions in the UAE, collective disputes are handled by a special committee composed of the Minister of Labour, a Supreme Court Judge, and one expert. In Dubai, individuals can also refer to a similar service provided by the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs as a first step before going to court. In 2015, a new department dedicated to resolving disputes between domestic helpers and sponsors has opened at the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) branch in Al Aweer. The department, a sub-branch of the Follow up on Illegals and Foreigners Sector, handles complaints from domestic helpers in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/crime/new-department-to-resolve-domestic-helpers-disputes-1.1538784|title=New department to resolve domestic helpers’ disputes|last=Bedirian|first=Razmig|date=2015-06-22|work=|newspaper=GulfNews|access-date=2016-11-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Dubai, the General Department of Human Rights at Dubai Police receives individual and collective complaints filed by workers against their employers. Complaints would be related to living conditions, wages, and security and safety of labour accommodations and this service is accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dubaipolice.gov.ae/dp/jsps/content/flat_content.do?contentCode=105947&lt;/ref&gt; 

As to civil servants in Dubai, employment complaints can be filed at the office of the Ruler of Dubai, which will attempt to find an agreement between the two parties. If it fails, it will issue the employee a letter addressed to the Dubai courts regarding the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/courts/navigating-labour-disputes-in-the-uae|title=Navigating labour disputes in the UAE {{!}} The National|website=www.thenational.ae|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Crown Prince of Dubai has approved the establishment of the Dubai government staff central grievances committee. Members of the committee include a representative from the General Secretariat of the Executive Council of the Emirate of Dubai, the higher legislation committee and the department of human resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/dubai-government-grievances-committee-established|title=Dubai government grievances committee established {{!}} The National|website=www.thenational.ae|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Protestant]] [[Christianity]], the relationship between '''Law and Gospel'''&amp;mdash;[[Divine Law|God's Law]] and the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus Christ]]&amp;mdash;is a major topic in [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] theology. In these religious [[tradition]]s, the distinction between the doctrines of Law, which demands obedience to God's [[ethic]]al will, and Gospel, which promises the [[forgiveness]] of [[sin]]s in light of the person and work of [[Jesus Christ]], is critical. Ministers use it as a [[hermeneutical]] principle of biblical interpretation and as a guiding principle in [[homiletics]] (sermon composition) and [[pastoral care]]. It involves the [[supersessionism|supersession]] of the [[Old Covenant]] (including traditional Jewish law, or [[halakha]]) by the [[New Covenant]] and [[Christian theology]].

Other Christian groups have a view on the issue as well, or more generally [[Christian views on the old covenant|views of the Old Covenant]], though the matter has not usually been as hotly debated or rigorously defined as in the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] traditions.

Sometimes the issue is discussed under the headings of "[[Biblical law in Christianity|Law]] and [[Divine grace|Grace]]", "[[Sin]] and Grace", "[[Letter and spirit of the law|Spirit and Letter]]", and "ministry ({{lang|grc|διακονíα}}, ''diakonia'') of death/condemnation" and "ministry of the Spirit/[[righteousness]]".&lt;ref name="Bible1"&gt;
[[s:Bible, King James, 2 Corinthians#Chapter 3|2 Cor. 3:6-9]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran view==

===Martin Luther and Lutheran theologians===
A specific formulation of the distinction of Law and Gospel was first brought to the attention of the Christian Church by [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), and laid down as the foundation of evangelical [[Lutheran]] biblical exegesis and exposition in Article 4 of the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'' (1531): "All Scripture ought to be distributed into these two principal topics, the Law and the promises. For in some places it presents the Law, and in others the promise concerning Christ, namely, either when [in the [[Old Testament]]] it promises that Christ will come, and offers, for His sake, the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal, or when, in the Gospel [in the [[New Testament]]], Christ Himself, since He has appeared, promises the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal.".&lt;ref name="BOC1"&gt;F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau, ed. and trans. &lt;cite&gt;Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church&lt;/cite&gt;, (St. Louis: [[Concordia Publishing House]], 1921), Apology IV (II).5, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Formula of Concord]] likewise affirmed this distinction in Article V, where it states: "We believe, teach, and confess that the distinction between the Law and the Gospel is to be maintained in the Church with great diligence..."&lt;ref name="BOC2"&gt;''Triglot Concordia'', FC Epitome V, (II).1, p. 503ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] wrote: "Hence, whoever knows well this art of distinguishing between Law and Gospel, him place at the head and call him a doctor of Holy Scripture."&lt;ref name="doctor"&gt;Martin Luther, ''Dr. Martin Luthers Sämmtliche Schriften'', St. Louis ed. (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, N.D.), vol. 9, col. 802.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|Lutheran Age of Orthodoxy]] (1580–1713) this hermeneutical discipline was considered foundational and important by Lutheran theologians.

This distinction was the first article in ''Patrick`s Places'' (1528) by [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="PP"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;''Patrick`s Places'' (1528)&lt;/cite&gt;[http://www.thereformation.info/patricks%20places.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.F.W. Walther|Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther]] (1811–1887), who was the first (and third) president of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], renewed interest in and attention to this theological skill in his evening lectures at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis 1884-85.&lt;ref name="dau"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel: 39 Evening Lectures&lt;/cite&gt;, W.H.T. Dau tr., 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book of Concord===
The [[Formula of Concord]] distinguished three uses, or purposes, in the Law in Article VI. It states: "[T]he Law was given to men for three reasons ..."

#that "thereby outward discipline might be maintained against wild, disobedient men [and that wild and intractable men might be restrained, as though by certain bars]"
#that "men thereby may be led to the knowledge of their sins"
#that "after they are regenerate ... they might ... have a fixed rule according to which they are to regulate and direct their whole life"&lt;ref name="BOC3"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Triglot Concordia&lt;/cite&gt;, ''Formula of Concord'', Epitome VI.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary concern was to maintain that the Law should continue to be used by Christians after they had been [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerated]] by the Holy Spirit through the Gospel to counter the doctrine of [[Johannes Agricola]], who taught that the [[Antinomianism#First Antinomian controversy|Law was no longer needed]] by regenerate Christians."&lt;ref name="BOC3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Bente, ''Historical Introductions to the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', chapter XVII: The Antinomistic Controversy, (St. Louis, MO: CPH, 1921), 161-172, cf. p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confessional Lutheranism]] teaches that the Law cannot be used to deny the Gospel, neither can the Gospel be used to deny God's Law.&lt;ref name=WLS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BuchholzJustification.pdf |title=Jesus canceled your debt! |last1=Bichholz |first1=Jon D. |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |quote=We embrace a parallel principle in our division of God’s word into law and gospel. The law (e.g., “God hates sinners,” [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps5:5&amp;version=NIV Psalm 5:5]) cannot be used to deny the gospel (“God loves sinners,” [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn3:16&amp;version=NIV John 3:16]), neither can the gospel be used to deny the law. Law passages teach the law, while gospel passages teach the gospel. |accessdate=31 Jan 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920085827/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BuchholzJustification.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three ''uses'' of the Law are:

#''Curb'' -  Through fear of punishment, the Law keeps the sinful nature of both Christians and non-Christians under check. This does not stop sin, since the sin is already committed when the heart desires to do what is wrong, yet it does stop the open outbreak of sin that will do even further damage.
#''Mirror'' - The Law serves as a perfect reflection of what God created the human heart and life to be. It shows anyone who compares his/her life to God's requirement for perfection that he/she is sinful.
#''Guide'' - This use of the law that applies only to Christians. The law becomes the believer's helper. Empowered by the gospel truth of forgiveness and righteousness in Christ, the believer's new self eagerly desires to live to please the Triune God.&lt;ref name=WELS-USES&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=21778 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080401021937/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=21778 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 1 April 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Uses Of The Law |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=29 Jan 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WELS-3RD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=6414 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102114247/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=46&amp;cuItem_itemID=6414 |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Third use of the Law |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=29 Jan 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformed view==
[[File:Cranach Gesetz und Gnade Gotha.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'', by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a Lutheran. The left side of the tree illustrates law, while the right side illustrates grace.]]

The distinction between law and gospel is a standard formulation in [[Reformed]] theology, though in recent years some have characterized it as distinctively Lutheran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Michael|title=The Distinction between Law and Gospel in Reformed Faith and Practice|volume=19|issue=5|pages=12–14|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&amp;var1=ArtRead&amp;var2=1164&amp;var3=main|work=Modern Reformation|accessdate=19 November 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zacharias Ursinus]] sharply distinguished the law and gospel as "the chief and general divisions of the holy scriptures" in his commentary on the [[Heidelberg Catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ursinus|first=Zacharias|title=The commentary of Dr. Zacharias Ursinus on the Heidelberg catechism|year=1888|publisher=Elm Street Printing Co|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNpDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=pa2|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Berkhof]] called the law and the gospel "the two parts of the Word of God as a [[means of grace]]." Law and Gospel are found in both testaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkhof|first=Louis|title=Systematic Theology|year=1979|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', the Reformer [[John Calvin]] distinguished three uses in the Law. Calvin wrote the following: "[T]o make the whole matter clearer, let us survey briefly the function and use of what is called the 'moral law.' Now, so far as I understand it, it consists of three parts."

# "[W]hile it shows God's righteousness . . . , it warns, informs, convicts, and lastly condemns, every man of his own unrighteousness" (2.7.6).
# It functions "by fear of punishment to restrain certain men who are untouched by any care for what is just and right unless compelled by hearing the dire threats in the law" (2.7.10).
# "It admonishes believers and urges them on in well-doing" (2.7.12-13).

This scheme is the same as the [[Formula of Concord]], with the exception that the first and second uses are switched.

In later [[Reformed scholasticism]] the order is the same as for Lutherans. The three uses are called:

# The ''usus politicus sive civilis'', the political or civil use, is a restraint on sin and stands apart from the work of salvation. It is part of God's [[general revelation]] or [[common grace]] for unbelievers as well as believers.
# The ''usus elenchticus sive paedagogicus'', the elenctical or pedagogical use which confronts sin and points us to Christ.
# The ''usus didacticus sive normativus'', the didactic use, which is solely for believers, teaching the way of righteousness.&lt;ref name=muller&gt;{{cite book|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|title=Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology|year=2006|publisher=Baker Book House|isbn=978-0801020643|pages=320–321|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heidelberg Catechism]], in explaining the third use of the Law, teaches that the moral law as contained in the [[Ten Commandments]] is binding for Christians and that it instructs Christians how to live in service to God in gratitude for His grace shown in redeeming mankind.&lt;ref name="OPC2018"/&gt; John Calvin deemed this third use of the Law as its primary use.&lt;ref name="OPC2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opc.org/qa.html?question_id=165|title=God's Law in Old and New Covenants|year=2018|publisher=[[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]]|language=English|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lutheran and Reformed differences==
[[Lutheran scholasticism|Scholastic Lutheran]] and Reformed theologians differed primarily on the way in which the third use of the law functions for believers. The Reformed emphasized the third use (''tertius usus legis'') because the redeemed are expected to bear [[good works]]. Some Lutherans saw here the danger of works-righteousness, and argued that the third use should always return believers to the second use and again to Christ rather than being the ultimate norm.&lt;ref name=muller /&gt;

Additionally, some have suggested that the third use of the law is not found at all in Luther but comes from [[Philip Melanchthon]]. Although some Lutherans have rejected that view,&lt;ref name=ThirdUse&gt;[http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/VII/7-3.htm "The Third Use of Law"] by [[John Warwick Montgomery]] in ''Present Truth'', vol. 7&lt;/ref&gt; it has caused others to dispute the validity of the "third use" of the Law entirely. [[Paul Althaus]], for instance, writes in his treatise on Law and Gospel: "This [ethical] guidance by the Holy Spirit implies that God's concrete commanding cannot be read off from a written document, an inherited scheme of law. I must learn afresh every day what God wants of me. For God's commanding has a special character for each individual: it is always contemporary, always new. God commands me (and each person) in a particular way, in a different way than He commands others.... The living and spiritual character of the knowledge of what God requires of men in the present moment must not be destroyed by rules and regulations."&lt;ref name="althaus"&gt;Paul Althaus, &lt;cite&gt;The Divine Command&lt;/cite&gt;, pp. 43, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Such theologians believe the third use leads to or encourages a form of [[legalism (theology)|legalism]] and is possibly an implicit denial of [[sola fide]]. Conversely, Reformed Christians have sometimes seen this two-use scheme of some modern Lutherans as leading to a form of [[antinomianism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Some believe that "for Luther the pedagogic use of the Law was primary, while for Calvin this third or didactic use was the principal one; yet [historically] both the Lutheran and the Reformed traditions maintain the threefold conceptualization."&lt;ref name=ThirdUse /&gt;

==Methodist view==
[[John Wesley]] admonished [[Methodist]] preachers to emphasize both the Law and the Gospel:&lt;ref name="Seedbed2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wesley on Preaching Law and Gospel |url=https://www.seedbed.com/law-gospel-wesley/ |publisher=Seedbed |date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Undoubtedly both should be preached in their turn; yea, both at once, or both in one. All the conditional promises are instances of this. They are law and gospel mixed together. According to this model, I should advise every preacher continually to preach the law — the law grafted upon, tempered by, and animated with the spirit of the gospel. I advise him to declare explain, and enforce every command of God. But meantime to declare in every sermon (and the more explicitly the better) that the flint and great command to a Christian is, ‘Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ’: that Christ is all in all, our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; that all life, love, strength are from Him alone, and all freely given to us through faith. And it will ever be found that the law thus preached both enlightens and strengthens the soul; that it both nourishes and teaches; that it is the guide, ‘ food, medicine, and stay’ of the believing soul.&lt;ref name="Seedbed2016"/&gt;}}
Methodism makes a distinction between the ceremonial law and the moral law that is the [[Ten Commandments]] given to Moses.&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt; In Methodist Christianity, the moral law is the "fundamental ontological principle of the universe" and "is grounded in eternity", being "engraved on human hearts by the finger of God."&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dayton |first1=Donald W. |title=Law and Gospel in the Wesleyan Tradition |journal=Grace Theological Journal |date=1991 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=233-243 |url=https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/gtj/12-2_233.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to the teaching of the Lutheran Churches, the Methodist Churches bring the Law and the Gospel together in a profound sense: "the law is grace and through it we discover the good news of the way life is intended to be lived."&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt; John Wesley, the father of the Methodist tradition taught:&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt;
{{quotation|... there is no contrariety at all between the law and the gospel; ... there is no need for the law to pass away in order to the establishing of the gospel. Indeed neither of them supersedes the other, but they agree perfectly well together. Yea, the very same words, considered in different respects, are parts both of the law and the gospel. If they are considered as commandments, they are parts of the law: if as promises, of the gospel. Thus, 'Thou shalt love the Lord the God with all thy heart,' when considered as a commandment, is a branch of the law; when regarded as a promise, is an essential part of the gospel-the gospel being no other than the commands of the law proposed by way of promises. Accordingly poverty of spirit, purity of heart, and whatever else is enjoined in the holy law of God, are no other, when viewed in a gospel light, than so many great and precious promises. There is therefore the closest connection that can be conceived between the law and the gospel. On the one hand the law continually makes way for and points us to the gospel; on the other the gospel continually leads us to a more exact fulfilling of the law .... We may yet further observe that every command in Holy Writ is only a covered promise. (Sermon 25, "Sermon on the Mount, V," II, 2, 3)&lt;ref name="Dayton1991"/&gt;}}

[[Daniel Defoe]] discusses three pairs of these predicates in his second and final sequel to ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''Serious Reflections'' (1720): "forbear and live", "do and live", "believe and live". According to Defoe, the first was established with Adam in paradise, the second as the Law with the children of Israel, and the third as the Gospel of Jesus Christ&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iT4KFumK2PkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U1OWLpiDB7F9R7x3bPnxlThfi89ZA&amp;ci=66%2C873%2C762%2C407&amp;edge=0 ''Serious reflections during the life and surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe: with his Vision of the angelic world''].

However Luther viewed all imperative commands as law, even the command to believe the Gospel. In [[On the Bondage of the Will|The Bondage of the Will]] he writes,

"[T]he commands exist to show, not our moral ability, but our inability. This includes God's command of all men everywhere to repent and believe the gospel, an impossible act of will apart from a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit uniting us to Christ .." p.&amp;nbsp;149

The '''[[law]] of [[Europe]]''' is diverse and changing fast today. Europe saw the birth of both the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]], which form the basis of the two dominant forms of legal system of private law, [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[common law]].

==History==
[[Image:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|right|150px|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]
The law of Europe has a diverse history. [[Roman law]] underwent major codification in the [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] of Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], as later developed through the [[Middle Ages]] by medieval legal scholars. In [[Medieval]] [[England]], judges retained greater power than their continental counterparts and began to develop a body of precedent. Originally civil law was one common legal system in much of [[Europe]], but with the rise of [[nationalism]] in the 17th century [[Nordic countries]] and around the time of the [[French Revolution]], it became fractured into separate national systems. This change was brought about by the development of separate national codes, of which the French [[Napoleonic Code]] and the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] and [[Swiss Civil Code|Swiss codes]] were the most influential. Around this time civil law incorporated many ideas associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The [[European Union]]'s Law is based on a codified set of laws, laid down in the [[European Union Law|Treaties]]. Law in the EU is however mixed with precedent in case law of the [[European Court of Justice]]. In accordance with its history, the interpretation of European law relies less on policy considerations than U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360'']; Martin Gelter &amp; [[Kristoffel Grechenig]], [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2421224 ''History of Law and Economics''], forthcoming in Encyclopedia on Law &amp; Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal English''' is the type of [[English language|English]] as used in [[legal writing]]. In general, a legal language is a formalized language based on [[logic]] rules which differs from the ordinary [[natural language]] in [[vocabulary]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]], as well as other linguistic features,&lt;ref&gt;Wydick, 2005b, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to achieve [[consistency]], [[Validity (logic)|validity]], [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] and [[soundness]], while keeping the benefits of a human-like language such as intuitive execution, complete [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and open [[upgrade]]. However, Legal English has been referred to as a "sublanguage",&lt;ref&gt;Tiersma, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; as legal English differs from ordinary English. A specialized use of certain terms and linguistic patterns governs the teaching of legal language. Thus, "we study legal language as a kind of second language, a specialized use of vocabulary, phrases, and syntax that helps us to communicate more easily with each other".&lt;ref&gt;Ramsfield, 2005, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''legal[[wikt:-ese|ese]]&lt;!--redirect--&gt;''', on the other hand, is a [[pejorative]] term associated with a traditional style of legal writing that is part of this specialized discourse of lawyers: communication that "lay readers cannot readily comprehend".&lt;ref&gt;Oates &amp; Enquist, 2009, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; This term describes poor legal writing that is cluttered, wordy, indirect, and that includes unnecessary technical words or phrases.&lt;ref name="Butler201332"&gt;Bain Butler, 2013, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, legalese is language a lawyer might use in drafting a contract or a pleading but would not use in ordinary conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Oates &amp; Enquist, 2009, p.128.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the traditional style of legal writing has been labeled reader-unfriendly.&lt;ref name="Butler201332"/&gt; Proponents of [[Plain English|plain language]] argue that legal "writing style should not vary from task to task or audience to audience...; whatever lawyers write must be Clear, Correct, Concise, and Complete".&lt;ref name="Wydick2005b3"&gt;Wydick, 2005b, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; These 4 Cs describe "characteristics of good legal writing style" in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wydick2005b3"/&gt;

There are different kinds (genres) of legal writing: for example, (a) academic legal writing as in law journals, (b) juridical legal writing as in court judgments, and (c) legislative legal writing as in laws, regulations, contracts, and treaties.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Another variety is the language used by lawyers to communicate with clients requiring a more "reader-friendly" style of written communication than that used with law professionals.&lt;ref name="Goddard2010"&gt;Goddard, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

For lawyers operating internationally, communicating with clients and other professionals across cultures requires a need for transnational [[legal awareness]] and transcultural linguistic awareness.&lt;ref name="Goddard2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bain Butler, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the form of legal writing, legal skills and language skills form a vital part of higher education and professional training.&lt;ref&gt;Bain Butler, 2013, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal English has particular relevance when applied to [[legal writing]] and the [[Draft document|drafting of written material]], including:
* legal documents: contracts, [[licence]]s, etc.
* [[Pleading|court pleadings]]: [[summons]]es, [[Brief (law)|briefs]], [[judgments]], etc.
* laws: [[Acts of Parliament]] and subordinate [[legislation]], case reports
* legal correspondence

Legal English has traditionally been the preserve of lawyers from [[List of countries where English is an official language|English-speaking countries]] (especially the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Kenya]], and [[South Africa]]) which have shared common law traditions. However, due to the spread of Legal English as the predominant language of [[international business]], as well as its role as a legal language within the [[European Union]], Legal English is now a global [[phenomenon]]. It may informally be referred to as '''lawspeak'''.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Historical development==
Modern legal English is based on [[standard English]]. Modern legal English contains, however, a number of unusual features. These features largely relate to [[terminology]], linguistic structure, linguistic conventions, and [[punctuation]], and have their roots in the [[History of the English language|history of the development of English]] as a legal language.

In [[prehistoric Britain]], traditional common law was discussed in the vernacular (see [[Celtic law]]). The legal language and legal tradition changed with waves of conquerors over the following centuries. [[Roman Britain]] (after the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest]] beginning in AD 43) followed Roman legal tradition, and its legal language was Latin. Following the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] circa 410 and the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain]], the dominant tradition was instead [[Anglo-Saxon law]], which was discussed in the Germanic vernacular (Anglo-Saxon, [[Old English]]), and written in Old English since circa 600, beginning with the [[Law of Æthelberht]]. Following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of England in 1066]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]] became the official language of legal proceedings in England for a period of nearly 300 years until the [[Pleading in English Act 1362]] (and continued in minor use for another 300 years), while [[Medieval Latin]] was used for written records for over 650 years. Some English technical terms were retained, however (see [[Anglo-Saxon law#Language and dialect|Anglo-Saxon law: Language and dialect]] for details).

In legal pleadings, Anglo-Norman developed into [[Law French]], from which many words in modern legal English are derived. These include ''property'', ''estate'', ''chattel'', ''lease'', ''executor'', and ''tenant''. The use of Law French during this period had an enduring influence on the general [[Register (sociolinguistics)|linguistic register]] of modern legal English. That use also accounts for some of the complex linguistic structures used in legal writing. In 1362, the [[Statute of Pleading]] was enacted, which stated that all legal proceedings should be conducted in English (but recorded in Latin). This marked the beginning of formal Legal English; Law French continued to be used in some forms into the 17th century, although Law French became increasingly degenerate.

From 1066, [[Latin]] was the language of formal records and [[statutes]], and was replaced by English in the [[Proceedings in Courts of Justice Act 1730]]. However, because only learned persons were fluent in Latin, it never became the language of legal pleading or debate. The influence of Latin can be seen in a number of words and phrases such as ''[[ad hoc]]'', ''[[de facto]]'', ''[[bona fide]]'', ''inter alia'', and ''[[ultra vires]],'' which remain in current use in legal writing (see [[Legal Latin]]).

===Style===
In 2004, [[David Crystal]] proposed a stylistic influence upon English legal language. During the [[Medieval]] period, lawyers used a mixture of [[Latin]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. To avoid ambiguity, lawyers often offered [[legal doublet|pairs of words]] from different languages. Sometimes there was little ambiguity to resolve and the pairs merely gave greater emphasis, becoming a stylistic habit. This is a feature of legal style that continues to the present day. Examples of mixed language doublets are: "breaking and entering" (English/French), "fit and proper" (English/French), "lands and tenements" (English/French), and "will and testament" (English/Latin). Examples of English-only doublets are "let and hindrance" and "have and hold".

Modern English vocabulary draws significantly from Germanic languages, French, and Latin, the lattermost often by way of French. These vocabularies are used preferentially in different registers, with words of French origin being more formal than those of Germanic origin, and words of Latin origin being more formal than those of French origin. Thus, the extensive use of French and Latin words in Legal English results in a relatively formal style.

Further, legal English is useful for its dramatic effect: for example, a [[subpoena]] compelling a witness to appear in court often ends with the archaic threat "Fail not, at your peril"; the "peril" isn't described (being arrested and held in [[contempt of court]]) but the formality of the language tends to have a stronger effect on the recipient of the subpoena than a simple statement like "We can arrest you if you don't show up".

Whereas legal language in the Medieval period combined Latin, French, and English to avoid ambiguity. According to Walter Probert, judicial lawyers, roughly starting in the twentieth century, often manipulate the language to be more persuasive of their campaign ideals.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6975&amp;context=penn_law_review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key features==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2011}}
As noted above, legal English differs greatly from standard English in a number of ways. The most important of these differences are as follows:

* Use of [[Technical terminology|terms of art]]. Legal English, in common with the language used by other trades and professions, employs a great deal of technical terminology which is unfamiliar to the [[layman]] (e.g. ''[[waiver]], [[restraint of trade]], [[restrictive covenant]], [[Estoppel|promissory estoppel]]''). Much of this vocabulary is derived from French and Latin.
* These terms of art include ordinary words used with special meanings. For example, the familiar term ''[[consideration]]'' refers, in legal English, to [[contract]]s, and means, ''an act, forbearance or promise by one party to a contract that constitutes the price for which the promise of the other party is bought'' (Oxford Dictionary of Law). Other examples are ''construction, prefer, redemption, furnish, hold,'' and ''find''.
* Lack of [[punctuation]]. One aspect of archaic legal drafting – particularly in conveyances and [[deed]]s – is the conspicuous absence of punctuation. This arose from a widespread idea among lawyers that punctuation was ambiguous and unimportant, and that the meaning of legal documents was contained only in the words used and their context. In some situations punctuation is omitted simply because it can be added undetectably to a document after it comes into effect, altering its meaning, so the view was, and still sometimes is, that a safer course is to omit punctuation altogether so that, if any should appear, it is apparent that it has been added later to change the meaning of the document, possibly fraudulently. In modern legal drafting, punctuation is often used, in the hope that clarifies [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butt|first1=Peter|last2=Castle|first2=Richard|title=Modern Legal Drafting: A Guide to Using Clearer Language|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521001861|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of [[Legal doublet|doublets and triplets]]. As noted above, the mix of languages used in early legalese led to the tendency in legal English to string together two or three words to convey what is usually a single legal concept. Examples of this are ''null and void, fit and proper, (due) care and attention, perform and discharge, terms and conditions, dispute, controversy or claim,'' and ''promise, agree and covenant''. While originally being done to help all lawyers no matter which vocabulary they might use (English, French, or Latin) it now sometimes repeats words used mean exactly the same thing, and has become a stylistic standard for other legal concepts (''dispute, controversy or claim'', ''search and seizure'').
* Unusual [[word order]]. At times, the word order used in legal documents appears distinctly strange. For example, ''the provisions for termination hereinafter appearing'' or ''will at the cost of the borrower forthwith comply with the same''. There is no single clear reason for this, although the influence of [[French grammar|French grammatical structures]] is certainly a contributory factor.
* Use of unfamiliar [[pro-form]]s. For example, ''the same, the said, the aforementioned'' etc. The use of such terms in legal texts is interesting since very frequently they do not replace the noun – which is the whole purpose of pro-forms – but are used as adjectives to modify the noun. For example, ''the said John Smith''.
* Use of [[pronominal adverbs]].  Words like ''hereof, thereof,'' and ''whereof'' (and further derivatives, including ''-at, -in, -after, -before, -with, -by, -above, -on, -upon'') are not often used in ordinary modern English. They are used in legal English primarily to avoid repeating names or phrases. For example, ''the parties hereto'' instead of ''the parties to this contract''.
* ''-er, -or,'' and ''-ee'' name endings. Legal English contains some words and titles, such as employer and employee; lessor and lessee, in which the reciprocal and opposite nature of the relationship is indicated by the use of alternative endings.
* Use of [[phrasal verbs]]. Phrasal verbs play a large role in legal English, as they do in standard English, and are often used in a quasi-technical sense. For example, ''parties '''enter into''' contracts, '''put down''' deposits, '''serve''''' [documents] '''''upon''' other parties, '''write off''' debts, '''attend at''' locations'', and so on.

==Education==
{{More citations needed|date=June 2007}}
Because of the prevalence of the English language in international business relations, as well as, its role as a legal language globally, a feeling has existed for a long period in the international legal community that traditional English language training is not sufficient to meet lawyers’ English language requirements. The main reason for this is that such training generally ignores the ways in which English usage may be modified by the particular demands of legal practice – and by the conventions of legal English as a separate branch of English in itself.

As a result, non-native English speaking legal professionals and law students increasingly seek specialist training in legal English, and such training is now provided by law schools, language centres,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cambridgelawstudio.co.uk/|title=Home|date=2012-03-19|work=Cambridge Law Studio|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; private firms and podcasts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://studylegalenglish.com/|title=The Study Legal English Podcast|last=|first=|date=|website=Study Legal English|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focus on legal language. The UK [[TOLES]] examination was set up to teach legal English to non-native English speakers. The exams focus on the aspects of legal English noted as lacking by lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toles.co.uk/pages/toles-and-other-legal-english-exams.php|title=Legal English TOLES Exam English For Lawyers|work=TOLES|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual [[Global Legal Skills Conference]] was also established as a forum for professors of Legal English and other skills professionals to exchange information on teaching methods and materials.&lt;ref&gt;http://glsc.jmls.edu/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LexML site.png|right|250px]]
The '''LexML''' is a joint initiative of the [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law legal system]] countries seeking to establish [[open standard]]s for the interchange, identification and structuring of legislative and court information, especially official documents.

Participated in this initiative are [[Germany]], [[Brazil]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], through local institutions, with the goal of convergence of national standards and the international standardization of some instruments, such as [[Lex (URN)|'''URN LEX''']] and the use of [[XML]] formatting standards and the exchange of its metadata.

One of the initial goals of the initiative, later abandoned, was the standardization of a single language (called ''LexML'') for marking of legal normative documents of all participating countries. The name "LexML" derives "lex" prefix (Law in Latin) and the acronym ML (English Markup Language) used as a suffix in XML markup languages schemes. 

Currently only [[LexML Brasil|'''Brazil LexML''']] initiative called "LexML" to its [[XML schema]]. Other former participants migrated to [[Akoma Ntoso]] and [[EUR-Lex]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2380">'''Mutual liberty''' is an idea first coined by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835 work ''[[Democracy in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, ''Democracy in America'' (New York: Bantam Books, 2000), 9–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, Tocqueville was referring to the general nature of [[United States|American]] [[society]] during the 19th century. It appeared to him, at least on the surface, that every [[citizen]] in the [[United States]] had the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunity]] to participate in the civic activities of the [[country]]. Another way to look at mutual liberty is by accounting for the collective [[free will]]s of every rational being in a [[community]]. Even though the notion of mutual liberty was introduced by Tocqueville, it was [[John Stuart Mill]] who greatly expanded it.&lt;ref name=mill&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''On Liberty and Utilitarianism'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1993), 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill believed that the most proper occasion for mutual liberty was in a community governed by the [[consent of the governed]], i.e., a [[republic]].&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; And according to Mill, it is only in a republic where members of all political [[Political faction|factions]] can participate.&lt;ref name=mill/&gt; It has been said that a republic is the form of government that divides people least.&lt;ref&gt;James McMillan, ''Modern France: 1880–2002'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement pertains greatly to mutual liberty. Unlike [[positive liberty|positive]] and [[negative liberty]], mutual liberty encompasses all citizens. It makes no distinction between political preference and social status. Mutual liberty pervades all sectors of society, from the homeless man on the street to the premier of the [[State (polity)|state]]. It is the process through which a general sense of [[morality]] gets exerted on the widest range of people in any given communal setting.

"'''No taxation without representation'''" is a [[slogan]] originating during the 1700s that summarized a primary grievance of the [[Colonial history of the United States#British colonies|American colonists]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], which was one of the major causes of the [[American Revolution]]. In short, [[Patriot (Revolution)|many in those colonies]] believed that, as they were not directly [[Representation (politics)|represented]] in the distant [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], any laws it passed affecting the colonists (such as the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]) were illegal under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and were a denial of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]].

[[Jonathan Mayhew]], [[Old West Church (Boston, Massachusetts)|Old West Church's]] second Congregational pastor, used the phrase, "no taxation without representation" in a sermon in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chris Beneke |year=2008 |title=The Critical Turn: Jonathan Mayhew, the British Empire, and the Idea of Resistance in Mid- Eighteenth-Century Boston |journal=Massachusetts Historical Review |volume=10|jstor=25478696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase revives a sentiment central to the cause of the [[English Civil War]] following the refusal of parliamentarian [[John Hampden]] to pay [[ship money]] tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Civil War|page=97

The English Parliament had controlled colonial trade and taxed imports and exports since 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1760s, the Americans were being deprived of a historic right.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution''. 1943. pp. 31, 99, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  The English [[Bill of Rights 1689]] had forbidden the imposition of taxes without the consent of Parliament.  Since the colonists had no representation in Parliament, the taxes violated the guaranteed [[Rights of Englishmen]].  Parliament initially contended that the colonists had [[virtual representation]], but the idea "found little support on either side of the Atlantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBvNHl6UYKsC&amp;pg=PA126|title=Recreating the American Republic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dunmore Lang]] wrote in 1852, "The person who first suggested the idea [of Parliamentary representation for the colonies] appears to have been Oldmixon, an American annalist of the era of Queen Anne or George I.  It was afterwards put forward with approbation by the celebrated Dr. [[Adam Smith]], and advocated for a time, but afterwards rejected and strongly opposed, by Dr. [[Benjamin Franklin]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/freedom-and-independence-lang-1852/19-parliamentary-representation/ 1.9 Parliamentary Representation. • E-Books • Webjournals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703184301/http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/freedom-and-independence-lang-1852/19-parliamentary-representation/ |date=2013-07-03 }}.

Jared Ingersoll Snr., colonial agent for Connecticut, wrote to his American colleague, the Royal Governor of Connecticut Thomas Fitch, that following Isaac Barre's famous Parliamentary speech against the Stamp Act in 1764, Richard Jackson, M.P., supported Barre and other pro-American M.P.s by producing before the House copies of earlier Acts of Parliament that had admitted Durham and Chester seats upon their petitions for representation.

==== The Knox-Burke debates ====
[[William Knox (British politician)|William Knox]], an aide of George Grenville, pamphleteer and subsequent Irish [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]], received an appointment in 1756 to the American provinces, and after his return to London in 1761, he recommended the creation of a colonial aristocracy and colonial representation in the British Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/WilliamKnox.php William Knox]. Libraryireland.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shortly afterwards appointed agent for Georgia and East Florida, a post which he forfeited by writing in favour of the Stamp Act. In his Grenville-backed pamphlet of 1769, ''The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed'', Knox suggested that colonial representatives might have been offered seats in the British Parliament if they had sought such representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamknoxoname00knox#page/18/mode/2up/search/offer |title=William Knox on American taxation, 1769 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knox submitted that, &lt;blockquote&gt;whilst [the radical colonists] exclaim against Parliament for taxing them when they are not represented, they candidly declare they will not have representatives [in Parliament] lest they should be taxed...The truth...is that they are determined to get rid of the jurisdiction of Parliament...and they therefore refuse to send members to that assembly lest they should preclude themselves of [the] plea [that Parliament's] legislative acts...are done without their consent; which, it must be confessed, holds equally good against all laws, as against taxes...The colony advocates...tell us, that by refusing to accept our offer of representatives they...mean to avoid giving Parliament a pretence for taxing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamknoxoname00knox#page/18/mode/2up/search/representatives |title=William Knox on American taxation, 1769 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edmund Burke responded to Knox, who had drawn up ''The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed'' as well as ''The Present State of the Nation'' (1768) under the supervision of George Grenville, by opining in his political tract ''Observations on a Late State of the Nation'' (1769), &lt;blockquote&gt;NOW comes [Knox's] American representation...Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter [of Grenville's]? It is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement; not from the necessity in the case, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances, and of obtaining redress. I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redress to their grievances. His great friend [Grenville] would once have been exceedingly displeased with any person, who should tell him, that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns. He thought he did so, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did so, when he formed two general systems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. These systems supposed, or ought to suppose, the greatest attention to, and the most detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American representation, he seems at last driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye, and so little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes, until we can secure the desired representation in parliament. Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity; although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004899151.0001.000?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The political tracts and speeches: of Edmund Burke, Esq.

While Knox, Grenville and Burke were not necessarily opposed in principle to direct colonial representation in Parliament, Grenville nonetheless conjectured that Parliament retained a constitutional right to virtually represent the colonial subjects.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 69 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6K8pM6Z3BdAC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=grenville+knox+virtual+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=grenville%20knox%20virtual%20representation&amp;f=false|title=The Constitutional Origins of the American Revolution|isbn=978-1-139-49293-5|author1=Greene|first1=Jack P|date=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''On the American Taxation'' ====
Burke supported the doctrine of virtual representation in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Page 58 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xH2lEKIZ4yMC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=burke+virtual+representation+philip+reid#v=onepage&amp;q=burke%20virtual%20representation%20philip%20reid&amp;f=false|title=The Concept of Representation in the Age of the American Revolution|isbn=978-0-226-70898-0|author1=Reid|first1=John Phillip|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet in his Parliamentary speech of 1774, entitled ''On American Taxation'', Burke responded to the suggestion that America was virtually represented in Parliament by remarking, &lt;blockquote&gt;What! does the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over the Atlantic than pervade Wales, which lies in your neighborhood? or than Chester and Durham, surrounded by abundance of representation that is actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?  You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great flood stops me in my course. Opposuit Natura. I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I do not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation; but I do not see my way to it; and those who have been more confident have not been more successful...My resolutions, therefore, mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by grant, and not by imposition; to mark the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to acknowledge that this legal competency has had a dutiful and beneficial exercise, and that experience has shown the benefit of their grants, and the futility of Parliamentary taxation, as a method of supply.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm#AMERICAN_TAXATION |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Burke's Writings and Speeches, Volume the Second, by Edmund Burke |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Burke apparently qualified such remarks concerning America by stating in the same speech that, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Parliament of Great Britain...is never to intrude into the place of the [provincial legislatures], whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable [Parliamentary]...superintendence, her powers must be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed? What! shall there be no reserved power in the empire, to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and dissipate the whole? We are engaged in waar,—the Secretary of State calls upon the colonies to contribute,—some would do it, I think most would cheerfully furnish whatever is demanded,—one or two, suppose, hang back, and, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft lie on the others,—surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, "Tax yourselves for the common Supply, or Parliament will do it for you." This backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some internal dissensions in that colony. But whether the fact were so or otherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever used in the first instance. This is what I meant, when I have said, at various times, that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an instrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== William Pitt the Elder ====
The views of Knox, Grenville and Burke did not go unchallenged: William Pitt was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy "internal" taxes "for the purposes of raising a revenue" without the consent of actual representatives of the "Commons of America".&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/3/23.html |title=II.

==== Colonial spokespersons ====
In 1764, the Massachusetts politician James Otis, Jr., said that, {{quote|When the parliament shall think fit to allow the colonists a representation in the house of commons, the equity of their taxing the colonies, will be as clear as their power is at present of doing it without, if they please...But if it was thought hard that charter privileges should be taken away by act of parliament, is it not much harder to be in part, or in whole, disfranchised of rights, that have been always thought inherent to a British subject, namely, to be free from all taxes, but what he consents to in person, or by his representative? This right, if it could be traced no higher than Magna Charta, is part of the common law, part of a British subjects birthright, and as inherent and perpetual, as the duty of allegiance; both which have been brought to these colonies, and have been hitherto held sacred and inviolable, and I hope and trust ever will. It is humbly conceived, that the British colonists (except only the conquered, if any) are, by Magna Charta, as well entitled to have a voice in their taxes, as the subjects within the realm. Are we not as really deprived of that right, by the parliament assessing us before we are represented in the house of commons, as if the King should do it by his prerogative? Can it be said with any colour of truth or justice, that we are represented in parliament?|sign=James Otis|source=''Rights of British Colonies Asserted''&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2335/Otis_RightsBritishColonies1556.pdf The rights of the British Colonies 1556]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Otis, Jr., attended the Continental Congress of 1765 along with other colonial delegates.  The resolutions of the Congress stated that the Stamp Act had "a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists" and that "the only Representatives of the People of these Colonies, are Persons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1068&amp;Itemid=264 |title=Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolu65.asp |title=Avalon Project – Resolutions of the Continental Congress October 19, 1765 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it was declared that, "it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the Principles and Spirit of the British Constitution, for the People of Great-Britain, to grant to his Majesty the Property of the Colonists."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu" /&gt;

Daniel Dulany, Jr., of Maryland, wrote in 1765 that, "the Impropriety of a Taxation by the British Parliament...[is proven by] the Fact, that not one inhabitant in any Colony is, or can be actually or virtually represented by the British House of Commons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=daniel+dulany+impropriety#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dulany%20impropriety&amp;f=false|title=Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British colonies, for the purpose of raising a revenue, by act of parliament [by D.

In 1766, Benjamin Franklin told the House of Commons that, "an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/8/10.html |title=I.

The Americans rejected the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]] brought in by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[George Grenville]], and violently rejected the remaining tax on [[tea]] [[import]]s, under the [[Tea Act]] passed in May 1773, at the [[Boston Tea Party]] on December 16, 1773. The Parliament considered this an illegal act because they believed it undermined the authority of the [[Crown-in-Parliament]]. When the British then used the military to enforce laws that the colonists believed Parliament had passed illegally, the colonists responded by forming [[militia]]s and seized political control of each colony, ousting the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|royal governor]]s – with the exception of the American-born Royal Governor of Connecticut, John Trumbull, who was allowed to remain as the new Patriot Governor.

The complaint was never officially over the amount of taxation (the taxes were quite low, though [[ubiquitous]]), but always on the political decision-making process by which taxes were decided in [[London]], i.e. without representation for the colonists in [[British Parliament]].

[[Patrick Henry]]'s resolution in the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia legislature]] implied that Americans possessed all the rights of Englishmen, that the principle of no taxation without representation was an essential part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], and that [[Virginia]] alone had the right to tax Virginians.&lt;ref&gt;Miller p 122–25&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Efforts at conciliation ====

This offer of actual imperial representation was likewise re-stated to the delegates of the colonies via the colonial agents in 1774, according to Connecticut-born Reverend Thomas Bradbury Chandler, in his publication ''A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaVbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=house&amp;f=false|title=A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans, on the Subject of Our ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1775, Britain passed the [[Conciliatory Resolution]] which ended taxation for any colony which satisfactorily provided for the imperial defence and the upkeep of imperial officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/documents/North.html |title=Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution [February 27, 1775&amp;#93; |publisher=Historycentral.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had they, like the County and City of Chester, represented, that "for lack of Knights and Burgesses to represent them in the High Court of Parliament, they had been oftentimes TOUCHED and GRIEVED with Acts and Statutes made within the said Court, derogatory to their most ancient jurisdictions, liberties and privileges, and prejudicial to their quietness, rest and peace;" this Country [of Britain] would, I am persuaded, have no objection to their being represented in her Parliament... If they are not madly bent on independence, let them propose the conditions on which they wish to continue as subjects...The Legislature of this Kingdom cannot possibly depart from any part of its supremacy over the Colonies; but it is in the power of the Colonies to share in that supremacy. If they complain of being taxed without having the privilege of sending Members to Parliament, let them be represented. Nay, more: Let their representation increase in proportion to the Revenue they shall furnish. If they wish rather to vote their QUOTA towards the general supply, through their own General Courts and Assemblies, the resolution of Parliament on that subject is still open to their choice. But, as long as they assume the language of a Sovereign State, this Kingdom can enter into no negociation [sic], can meet no compromise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004772194.0001.000/1:2?firstpubl1=1700;firstpubl2=1800;rgn=div1;sort=occur;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America: being an answer to the declaration of the General Congress |publisher=Quod.lib.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/rightsofgreatbri00macp |title=The rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America: being an answer to the Declaration of the general Congress : Macpherson, James, 1736–1796 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The noted economist Adam Smith seconded this view in his famous 1776 publication ''Wealth of Nations'' when he recommended the Americans "to send fifty or sixty new representatives to Parliament" on the basis of the amount of taxes they would contribute to the Imperial coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Smith |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/book04/ch07c-2.htm |title=Wealth of Nations  Bk 4 Chpt 07 (III p.2) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in October 1776 to Lord North in ''Strictures upon the Declaration of the Congress'' of the recent Declaration of Independence, and particularly of James Otis, Jr.'s pamphlet ''Rights of the British Colonies'' and its endorsement by the Massachusetts Assembly, Governor Thomas Hutchinson said, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay, therefore, was the first that took any publick of the [Sugar] Act, and the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament to impose Duties or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764, which they took care to print and publish before it was possible for him to receive it. And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons. I have this special reason, my Lord, for taking notice of this Act of the Massachusetts Assembly; that though an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet it was only intended to amuse the authority in England; and as soon as it was known to have its advocates here [in London], it was renounced by the colonies, and even by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable."&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson 1776" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Indeed, the resolves of the Continental Congresses of both 1765 and 1774 declared that imperial representation was too impractical on the footing that "local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp |title=Avalon Project – Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Government, similarly, does not appear to have formally requested discussions with the Americans concerning the issue of Parliamentary seats until 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=550146|title=Chatham and the Representation of the Colonies in the Imperial Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqw3ou3i1McC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false John Phillip Reid, ''The Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Law'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year "the commissioners of the king of Great Britain," known as the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, made an offer to the Congress of "a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different states, who shall have the privilege of a seat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain".&lt;ref name="teachingamericanhistory.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''The Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Law'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003), p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virtual representation ==
{{Main article|Virtual representation}}

In Britain, representation was highly limited due to unequally distributed voting constituencies and property requirements; only 3% of the population could vote and they were often controlled by local gentry.  This meant that spurious arguments had come to be employed in Britain to try to explain away and cover up the iniquities in its political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGee|first=Michael C.|title=The Rhetorical Process in Eighteenth Century England|url=http://mcgeefragments.net/OLD/rhetorical_process_england.htm |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515204305/http://mcgeefragments.net/OLD/rhetorical_process_england.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |title=Exhibitions &amp;#124; Citizenship &amp;#124; Struggle for democracy |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller p 212&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] tried to argue that the colonists had [[virtual representation]] in their interests.  In the winter of 1764–65, George Grenville, and his secretary Thomas Whately, invented the doctrine of 'virtual representation' in an attempt extend the scope of such unjust arguments to America, and thereby attempt to legitimise the pernicious policies of the Stamp Act.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 13: Law and the Origins of the American Revolution – {{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Law in America, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KeEi14czrnoC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=whately+virtual+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=whately%20virtual%20representation&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-80305-2|author1=Grossberg|first1=Michael|last2=Tomlins|first2=Christopher|date=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Debating the Issues in Colonial Newspapers: Primary Documents on Events of ..|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bm6kNpvnnhgC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=thomas+whately+virtual+representation+secretary+grenville#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20whately%20virtual%20representation%20secretary%20grenville&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-313-30982-3|author1=Copeland|first1=David A|date=2000-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5: Transformation – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6-tKuFD1KsC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=virtual+representation+american+revolution#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20representation%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=THE IDEOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION|isbn=978-0-674-07666-2|author1=Bailyn|first1=Bernard|date=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English history, "no taxation without representation" was an old principle and meant that Parliament had to pass all taxes. At first, the "representation" was held to be one of land, but, by 1700, this had shifted to the notion that, in Parliament, all British subjects had a "virtual representation." "We virtually and implicitly allow the institutions of any government of which we enjoy the benefit and solicit the protection," declared [[Samuel Johnson]] in his political pamphlet ''Taxation No Tyranny''. He rejected the plea that the colonists, who had no vote, were unrepresented. "They are represented," he said, "by the same virtual representation as the greater part of England."  However, the tradition of greater democracy amongst Americans gave impetus to the well-founded charge, voiced by Britons and colonists alike, that virtual representation was "sophistry" and "a mere Cob-web, spread to catch the unwary, and intangle [''sic''] the weak."&lt;ref&gt;Page 7 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=daniel+dulany+cob-web,+spread+to+catch+the+unwary#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dulany%20cob-web%2C%20spread%20to%20catch%20the%20unwary&amp;f=false|title=Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British colonies …|author1=Dulany|first1=Daniel|year=1765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 82 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jnNbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=sophistry+virtual+representation+british#v=onepage&amp;q=sophistry%20virtual%20representation%20british&amp;f=false|title=A Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of Hilsborough, on the …, Volume 3|year=1769}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colonial insistence on direct representation as opposed to virtual representation has thus been seen by later commentators to have "usher[ed] in a profound political and social revolution, which rooted out most of the remaining traces of monarchic rule and feudalism inherited from the only partially complete English bourgeois revolution. The Americans carried through the bourgeois democratic revolution on a scale never before seen in history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/class-struggle-and-the-american-revolution.htm|title=Class Struggle and the American Revolution|work=In defense of Marxism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial reactions ===
Virtual representation was wholly rejected in the colonies also  who said the "virtual" was a cover for [[political corruption]] and was irreconcilable with their belief that government derives its just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].  In 1765, the American lawyer and politician James Otis, Jr., responded to Soame Jenyns' ''The Objections to the Taxation of Our American Colonies, by the Legislature of Great Britain, Briefly Considered''.&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org"&gt;[http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2336/Otis_Considerations1555_Bk.pdf Considerations on behalf of the colonists in a letter to a noble Lord]&lt;/ref&gt;  Otis' own publication was entitled ''Considerations on Behalf of the Colonists, in a Letter to a Noble Lord''.&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org" /&gt;  He wrote in it, "To what purpose is it to ring everlasting changes to the colonists on the cases of Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield, who return no members?  If those now so considerable places are not represented, they ought to be."&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 169 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6-tKuFD1KsC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=virtual+representation+american+revolution#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20representation%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution|isbn=978-0-674-07666-2|author1=Bailyn|first1=Bernard|date=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in his 1763 publication ''The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved'', Otis declared that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every British subject born on the continent of America, or in any other of the British dominions, is by the law of God and nature, by the common law, and by act of parliament, (exclusive of all charters from the Crown) entitled to all the natural, essential, inherent and inseparable rights of our fellow subjects in Great Britain. Among those rights...which it is humbly conceived no man or body of men, not excepting the parliament, justly, equitably and consistently with their own rights and the constitution, can take away...[are that the] supreme and subordinate powers of the legislation should be free and sacred in the hands where the community have once rightfully placed them...[that the] supreme national legislative cannot be altered justly ’till the commonwealth is dissolved, nor a subordinate legislative taken away without forfeiture or other good cause. Nor then can the subjects in the subordinate government be reduced to a state of slavery, and subject to the despotic rule of others...Even when the subordinate right of legislature is forfeited, and so declared, this cannot affect the natural persons either of those who were invested with it, or the inhabitants, so far as to deprive them of the rights of subjects and of men — The colonists will have an equitable right notwithstanding any such forfeiture of charter, to be represented in Parliament, or to have some new subordinate legislature among themselves. It would be best if they had both...[Furthermore, the right of every British subject is that the] supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property, without his consent in person, or by representation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Frohnen |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=669&amp;chapter=206126&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=The American Republic: Primary Sources – Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Otis simultaneously refuted, in ''The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved'', a contemporary argument that attempted to rationalise virtual representation on the basis of the [[Colonial agent|colonial agents']] alleged influence on British policy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;  "As to the colonists being represented by the provincial agents," he wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know of no power ever given them but to appear before his Majesty, and his ministry. Sometimes they have been directed to petition the parliament: But they none of them have, and I hope never will have, a power given them, by the colonists, to act as representatives, and to consent to taxes; and if they should make any concessions to the ministry, especially without order, the provinces could not by that be considered as represented in parliament.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Colonists said no man was represented if he were not allowed to vote. Moreover, even "If every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold," said [[Daniel Dulany the Younger|Daniel Dulany]], "not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to become an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tracts of the American Revolution 1763–1776|editor=Merrill, Jensen|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cfo8b75HOT0C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=If+every+inhabitant+of+America+had+the+requisite+freehold+not+one+could+vote,+but+upon+the+supposition+of+his+ceasing+to+become+an+inhabitant+of+America,+and+becoming+a+resident+of+Great+Britain.%22#v=onepage&amp;q=If%20every%20inhabitant%20of%20America%20had%20the%20requisite%20freehold%20not%20one%20could%20vote%2C%20but%20upon%20the%20supposition%20of%20his%20ceasing%20to%20become%20an%20inhabitant%20of%20America%2C%20and%20becoming%20a%20resident%20of%20Great%20Britain.%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0-87220-693-9|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists and like-minded Britons insisted that representation was achieved only through an assembly of men actually elected by the persons they were intended to represent.&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt;

The argument between the colonies and Parliament sought to resolve how the British 'commoners' of the various part of the Empire were represented most constitutionally&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; – as Daniel Dulaney, an American Loyalist and lawyer, put it "[the] constitutional authority [of Parliament's rights to bind American subjects] depends upon the single question, Whether the Commons of Great-Britain are virtually the representatives of the Commons of America, or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/gkornbl/H397F10/Dulany-Considerations.htm |title=Considerations on the Propriety of Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies, for the Purpose of Raising a Revenue, by Act of Parliament |publisher=Oberlin.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pitt and Camden ===
The theory of virtual representation was attacked in Britain by [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden]], and his ally [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]].  William Pitt argued in 1766 that the Commons of Britain ought not to tax the '"Commons of America" without gaining consent of their representatives in stating, "even under former arbitrary reigns, Parliaments were ashamed of taxing a people without their consent, and allowed them representatives. Why did [Grenville] confine himself to Chester and Durham? He might have taken a higher example in Wales—Wales, that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated."&lt;ref name="bartleby.com" /&gt; He then said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I am no courtier of America. I stand up for this kingdom. I maintain that the Parliament has a right to bind, to restrain America. Our legislative power over the colonies is sovereign and supreme. When it ceases to be sovereign and supreme, I would advise every gentleman to sell his lands, if he can, and embark for that country. When two countries are connected together like England and her colonies, without being incorporated, the one must necessarily govern. The greater must rule the less. But she must so rule it as not to contradict the fundamental principles that are common to both... let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to every point of legislation whatsoever; that we may bind their trade, confine their manufactures, and exercise every power whatsoever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/cbo/chatham/chat08.htm#N_5_ |author=Earl of Chatham|title=Right of Taxing America|date=January 14, 1766 |publisher=Classicpersuasion.org |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his first speeches in Parliament, Lord Camden vigorously attacked the declaratory act which was proposed to mollify the crown on the repeal of the Stamp Tax. After his first affirmation of "no taxation without representation" Camden was attacked by British PM Grenville, [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Chief Justice]] [[James Mansfield]], [[Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 170-77. "Lord Northington, leaving the woolsack, commenced in a tone most insulting to the new Peer, and, what was much worse, most insulting to the people of America,--Benjamin Franklin being a listener below the bar … ." 5 Lord Campbell, Lives of the Lord Chancellors, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he British Parliament have no right to tax the Americans. I shall not consider the Declaratory Bill now lying on your table; for to what purpose, but loss of time, to consider the particulars of a Bill, the very existence of which is illegal, absolutely illegal, contrary to the fundamental laws of nature, contrary to the fundamental laws of this constitution? A constitution grounded on the eternal and immutable laws of nature; a constitution whose foundation and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every individual who may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxation and representation are inseparably united; God hath joined them, no British parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it, is to stab our very vitals. … My position is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my last hour,—taxation and representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and representation are coeval with and essential to the constitution. … [T]here is not a blade of grass growing in the most obscure corner of this kingdom, which is not, which was not ever, represented since the constitution began; there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor. … I can never give my assent to any bill for taxing the American colonies, while they remain unrepresented; for as to the distinction of a virtual representation, it is so absurd as not to deserve an answer; I therefore pass it over with contempt. The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery: they did not give up their rights; they looked for protection, and not for chains, from their mother country; by her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it: for, should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, ‘What property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?’"&lt;ref&gt;16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 177-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In an appearance before Parliament in January, 1766, former Prime Minister [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of a man. It does not deserve a serious refutation. The Commons of America, represented in their several assemblies, have ever been in possession of the exercise of this their constitutional right, of giving and granting their own money. They would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it.&lt;ref&gt;Walford Davis Green, ''William Pitt, Earl of Chatham and the Growth and Division of the British Empire, 1708–1778.'' 1901. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grenville responded to Pitt, saying the disturbances in America "border on open rebellion; and if the doctrine I have heard this day be confirmed, nothing can tend more directly to produce a revolution." External and internal taxes are the same, argued Grenville.&lt;ref&gt;sFor legal questions surrounding the constitutional nature of the Imperial Crown-in-Parliament's right to legislate and tax for the British Isles and Empire, and the colonies' chartered rights to legislate and tax themselves see {{Cite journal

Wall]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] invoked the principle of "no taxation without representation", initiating an anti-tax protest in which she encouraged women not to pay taxes until they were [[Women's suffrage in the United States|granted the right to vote]]. Soon after she began this movement, the Worcester city tax collector sued Wall for refusing to pay taxes, and the case reached the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] in 1863. In "Wheeler v. Wall," the court ruled against Wall and held that despite not having the right to vote, women are still obligated to meet their tax burden. Even still, Wall refused to cooperate with the collector, and as a result, officers seized and sold her property in order to raise the money necessary to meet her tax obligation. After several years, Wall's inexorability eventually prevailed, as the collector began to ignore Wall and allow her to abstain from paying taxes.&lt;ref name=UMKC&gt;{{cite web|title=Address of Susan B. Anthony|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/anthony/anthonyaddress.html|work=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, [[Susan B. Anthony]] cited Wall's audacity and willingness to stand up for women's suffrage, stating, "for the last twenty-five years, [she] has resisted the tax gatherer when he came around. I want you to look at her. She looks very harmless, but she will not pay a dollar of tax. She says when the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] will give her the right of representation she will pay her taxes."&lt;ref name=Sven&gt;{{cite web|title=Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, 2d Session, 49th Congress, December 8, 1886, and January 25, 1887|url=http://www.sveninho.com/book/2259482/Debate-on-Woman-Suffrage-in-the-Senate-of-the-United-States--2d-Session--49th-Congress--December-8--1886--and-January-25--1887/|work=Sven Digital Books|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also used by other groups in America who pay various types of taxes ([[Sales tax|sales]], [[income tax|income]], [[property tax|property]]) but lack the ability to vote, such as [[Felony|felons]] (who are, in many states, [[Disenfranchisement|barred from voting]]), people who work in one state and live in another (thus having to pay income tax to a state they don't live in), or [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|people under 18]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://16tovote.com/reasons.html Top Reasons National Youth Rights Association of Southeast Florida Wants a Lower Voting Age], 16tovote.com&lt;/ref&gt;

To become citizens of the United States, [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] most often must be permanent residents for a period of time (usually 5 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscis.gov/graphics/services/factsheet/howdoi/B3.pdf |title=USCIS Home Page |publisher=Uscis.gov |accessdate=2011-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925104214/http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/factsheet/howdoi/B3.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent residents must pay taxes on their worldwide income and, in most cases, cannot [[Elections in the United States|vote]]. However, throughout the 19th century, many states did allow immigrants to vote after they had declared their intention to become citizens. This was primarily because these new states were populated in large part by immigrants who had not yet attained citizenship. Throughout U.S. history, non-citizens have been allowed to vote in 40 U.S. states and territories.&lt;ref name=hayduk2006&gt;{{Citation

In 2009, the phrase "taxation without representation" was also used in the [[Tea Party protests]], where protesters were upset over increased government spending and taxes, and specifically regarding a growing concern amongst the group that the U.S. government is increasingly relying upon a form of taxation without representation through increased regulatory levies and fees which are allegedly passed via unelected government employees who have no direct responsibility to voters and cannot be held accountable by the public through elections.&lt;ref name=foxchicago&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/TeaParty |title=Protestors Gather for Self-Styled Tea Party |publisher=Myfoxchicago.com |date=February 27, 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified version of the phrase, "no tuition without representation", is sometimes used in disputes over [[governance in higher education]] in the United States to emphasize student's rights to a voice in institutional decisions.  The term first emerged in a 1977 dispute at [[Union County College]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Jersey's Union College: A History, 1933–1983|page=232

In the United States, the phrase is used in [[Washington, D.C.]] as part of the [[District of Columbia voting rights|campaign for a vote]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]], to publicize the fact that Washington residents pay Federal taxes, but do not have representation in Congress. In November 2000, the D.C.

== Modern use in the United Kingdom ==
British Prime Minister [[John Major]] used a modified version of the quote, with the order reversed, in October 1995, when at the [[United Nations]]'s 50th Anniversary celebrations he said, "It is not sustainable for states to enjoy representation without taxation," in order to criticize the billion-dollar [[arrears]] of the United States' payments to the UN, echoing a statement made the previous month at the opening session of the UN General Assembly by UK Foreign Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/finance/chronol/fin1995.htm |title=Chronology of the United Nations Financial Crisis: 1995 – Global Policy Forum |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use in Canada ==
In Canada, [[Québec]] politician [[Gilles Duceppe]], former leader of the [[Bloc Québécois]], has repeatedly cited this phrase in defending the presence of his party in [[Ottawa]]. The Bloc is a [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Québec sovereigntist]] party solely running candidates in Canadian Federal elections in the province of Québec. Duceppe's evocation of the phrase implies that the proponents of Quebec's sovereigntist movement have the right to be represented in the body (which they are), the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], which levies taxes upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-bloc-at-20-a-conversation-with-gilles-duceppe/|magazine=Maclean's|date=2010-05-20|title=The Bloc at 20: a conversation with Gilles Duceppe|first=John|last=Geddes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will usually cite the sentence in its original English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=L'actualité|date=2005-11-01|first=Micheline|last=Lachance|title=Il fait bouger le Canada|url=http://www.lactualite.com/actualites/politique/il-fait-bouger-le-canada/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Australia ==
The first government of [[South Australia]] was by a [[South Australian Legislative Council|legislative council]], whose members were chosen by the Crown and from which office-bearers "Official Members" were selected by the Governor. [[John Stephens (editor)|John Stephens]] and his ''[[South Australian Register]]'' were among those who campaigned for democratic reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38442211 |title=A Free Press and Mr John Stephens |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] (Adelaide, SA : 1839–1900) |location=Adelaide, SA |date=April 1, 1850 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial reform took place in 1851, when a majority of [[Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1851–1855]] were elected.

'''Practising Law Institute''' ('''PLI''') is a non-profit [[continuing legal education]] (CLE) organization chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York. Founded in 1933, the company organizes and provides CLE programs around the world. Its programs are held in multiple locations including New York, California, Illinois, Washington D.C., Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, London, and Hong Kong.

Programs are also offered in various formats, including live webcasts, MP3s, and on-demand videos. PLI's headquarters are located in New York City, New York; it also maintains an office in San Francisco, California.

==History==
Founded in 1933, PLI was established to offer courses in the practice of law for lawyers recently admitted to the bar and/or those seeking to learn the elements of practicing in the field. As the country was seeing a transition from apprenticeship to formal law school education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-professions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706002749/http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-professions.html |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York City lawyer by the name of Harold Seligson recognized the need for practical training in law and originated a series of lectures called “Practising Law Courses.” These lectures would be the germination of the full-fledged Institute that exists today under the banner of the Practising Law Institute (PLI).

By 1939, the Institute had been formally chartered by the Regents of the State of New York. It was able to take advantage of certain historical forces, including the [[New Deal]] and the federal regulation of business activity it inspired. The [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], for example, initiated a new specialization in the law. This new specialization in turn created a need for a new kind of [[continuing legal education]], which we see in practice today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a not-for-profit educational organization, PLI continues to offer pro bono programs and scholarships to lawyers and student in need of assistance. In 2012, PLI awarded over 26,000 scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pli.edu/emktg/Annual_Report2012/AnnualReport2012.html|title=AnnualReport2012|work=pli.edu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27th, 2015 the PLI Board of Trustees formally installed Anita Carr Shapiro as its fifth president. She succeeded Victor J. Rubino who was unanimously approved as President Emeritus after serving as PLI's President since 1983. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/practising-law-institute-appoints-anita-carr-shapiro-as-president-and-victor-j-rubino-as-president-emeritus-300071956.html|title=Practising Law Institute Appoints Anita Carr Shapiro as President and Victor J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">The '''printing patent''' or '''printing privilege''' was a precursor of modern [[copyright]]. It was an exclusive right to print a work or a class of works.

The earliest recorded printing privilege dates from 1469, giving [[John of Speyer]] a five-year [[monopoly]] on all printing in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. In 1495, the city-state granted another monopoly on all Greek works to [[Aldus Manutius|Aldus]] as a reward for his investments in a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[typeface|font]] for his [[printing press|press]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M. (2002) From Private to Public: Reexamining the Technological Basis for Copyright, ''Journal of Communication'', 52, 416-433&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], the royal ''Code de la librairie'' of 1723 codified existing practice. It stated that there was no property in ideas or texts. Ideas, it was argued, were a gift from [[God]], revealed through the writer. [[Divine Right of Kings|God's first representative]], the [[Absolute monarchy in France|French king]] had the exclusive right to determine what could be printed by whom. Only members of the royal guild of publishers could apply for a "printing privilege", a permission and an exclusive right to print a work. Authors wishing to see their manuscript printed had no choice but to sell it to guild members. Most printing privileges were owned by the guild and automatically renewed over generations. In 1789, the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] created by the [[French Revolution]] brought an end to all royal privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, C. (1990) Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship in Revolutionary France, 1777-1793 ''Representations'', 109-137&lt;/ref&gt;

English monarchs granted printing patents based on the [[Royal Prerogative]], with patents falling into one of two categories: ''particular patents'' gave an exclusive right to print a single work &amp;ndash; often popular, classic works written centuries earlier &amp;ndash; for a limited time, usually seven or ten years. ''General patents'' were usually granted for life and covered a class of works, such as law books or [[almanac]]s. Printing patents were independent of the private copyright system established by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], even though most printing patents were granted to members of the Company. The importance of printing privileges decreased over time, but they still existed after the [[Statute of Anne]] was enacted.&lt;ref name="Patterson1968"&gt;[[Lyman Ray Patterson|Patterson, L. R.]] (1968) ''[[Copyright in Historical Perspective]]'', Vanderbilt University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The royal prerogative relating to printing patents was not removed until 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Donner, I.

{{one source|date=June 2009}}
A '''privilege''' is a certain entitlement to [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] granted by the state or another authority to a restricted group, either by birth or on a conditional basis. Land-titles and taxi medallions are pronounced examples of transferable privilege. These can be revoked in certain circumstances. In modern democratic states, a ''privilege'' is conditional and granted only after birth.  By contrast, a ''[[right]]'' is an inherent, irrevocable entitlement held by all citizens or all human beings from the moment of birth. Various examples of old [[common law]] privilege still exist, to title deeds, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanna McNichol, ''The Law of Privilege'' (1st ed., 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologically, a privilege (''privilegium'') means a "private law", or rule relating to a specific individual or institution.

Note that the principles of conduct that members of the legal profession observe in their practice are called Legal ethics. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/legal-ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boniface]]'s [[Fulda monastery|abbey of Fulda]], to cite an early and prominent example, was granted ''[[privilege (canon law)|privilegium]]'', setting the abbot in direct contact with the pope, bypassing the jurisdiction of the local bishop.

One of the objectives of the [[French Revolution]] was the abolition of privilege. This meant the removal of separate laws for different [[social class]]es ([[nobility]], [[clergy]], and ordinary people), instead subjecting everyone to the same common law. Privileges were abolished by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] on August 4, 1789.

==Protection from subpoena== 
One common legal privilege in the United States and Commonwealth countries is protection from the requirement to testify or provide documents in certain situations (see [[privilege (evidence)]]). This is granted to people based on a professional or personal relationship (such as being the lawyer, doctor, or spouse of the accused) and not based on circumstances of birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7880">'''Prohibitionism''' is a [[legal philosophy]] and [[political theory]] often used in [[lobbying]] which holds that citizens will abstain from actions if the actions are typed as unlawful (i.e. prohibited) and the prohibitions are enforced by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies&gt;C Canty, A Sutton. ''Strategies for community-based drug law enforcement: From prohibition to harm reduction''; in T Stockwell, PJ Gruenewald, JW Toumbourou, WLoxley W, eds. ''Preventing Harmful Substance Use: The Evidence Base for Policy and Practice.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., 2005. pp. 225-236.&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy has been the basis for many acts of [[statutory law]] throughout history, most notably when a large group of a given population disapproves of and/or feels threatened by an activity in which a smaller group of that population engages, and seeks to render that activity legally prohibited.&lt;ref name=cantystrategies/&gt;

== Examples ==
Acts of prohibition have included [[sumptuary law|prohibitions on types of clothing]] (and [[Public nudity|prohibitions on lack of clothing]]), prohibitions on [[gambling]] and [[striptease|exotic dancing]], the [[prohibition of drugs]] (for example, [[prohibition of alcohol|alcohol prohibition]] and [[cannabis prohibition]]), [[smoking ban|prohibitions on tobacco smoking]], and [[gun prohibition]]. Indeed, the period of [[Prohibition in the United States]] between 1920 and 1933 due to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and the [[Volstead Act]] often is referred to simply as "[[Prohibition]]", as is the "[[War on Drugs]]" that succeeded it. &lt;br /&gt;
An additional example, called ''nettle war'': Since 2002 in [[France]] the sale of nettle liquid manure was prohibited, and since 2006, unauthorized plant protection products (such as nettle liquid manure) to sell, own and operate.  Even [[advertising]] and recommendations for these products were not allowed. Only since 2011, it was legalized again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023912654 Decree 2011: Nettles were legalized again (fr)] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The film by [[Arte]] about it was completed in 2010 (''Nettle-war, mysterious plants - Nettle'', 42:04 minutes)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eraclito450.blogspot.de/2013/09/brennessel-krieg-geheimnisvolle.html nettle-war in France] Retrieved 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
The success of a measure of prohibitionism has been criticized as often depending too much upon effective enforcement of the relevant legislation. Some people{{Who|date=July 2011}} have argued this is because the majority of the targets of prohibitionism are in the category of [[victimless crime]], where they claim the harm that comes from the crime is non-existent, questionable, or only to the person who performs the act and even then the magnitude of the harm being relatively small.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Under this interpretation enforcement becomes a conflict between violation of statue and violation of free will.{{Why?|date=July 2011}} Since the acts prohibited often are enjoyable, enforcement is often the most harmful choice to the individual. This sometimes results in laws which rarely are enforced by anybody who does not have a financial or personal motivation to do so.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The difficulty of enforcing prohibitionist laws also criticized as resulting in selective enforcement, wherein the enforcers select the people they wish to prosecute based on other criteria, resulting in [[discrimination]] based on races, culture, nationality, or financial status. For example, [[United States|American]] philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized drug prohibition as being a technique of [[social control]] of the "so-called dangerous classes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20020208.htm Noam Chomsky, "On the War on Drugs", ''Week Online'', DRCNet, February 8, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prohibitionism based laws have the added problem of calling attention to the behavior that they are attempting to prohibit.  This can make the behavior interesting and exciting, and cause its popularity to increase. This is essentially in relation with the [[Streisand effect]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">'''Proximity of blood''', or '''proximity by degree''' of [[degree of kinship|kinship]], is one of the ways to determine [[Hereditary title|hereditary]] [[Order of succession|succession]] based on [[genealogy]]. In effect, the application of this rule is a refusal to recognize the [[per stirpes|right of representation]], a component of [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}}

In some feudal entities, proximity of blood was a generally accepted principle. For example, it is called the "ancient custom" ({{lang-fr|ancienne coutume}}) in the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], where a grandson could not take precedence over a son, and it was not even clear whether the ruler's grandson could claim precedence over the ruler's brother.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

== Examples ==
Proximity of blood and primogeniture were at loggerheads in numerous medieval succession disputes.

===Successful applications===
*When [[Richard the Lionheart]] died in 1199, the succession to the English throne, as well as to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], was disputed between his fourth but sole surviving brother, [[John, King of England|John]], and his nephew [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]] (the son of his second brother, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]]). The Angevin law favored primogeniture and thus Arthur, while the Norman law recognized the proximity of blood and gave precedence to John. Arthur's claim had been recognized by Richard in 1191, but just before his death Richard expressed support for John, who in the end prevailed.{{sfn|Barlow|1999|p=305}}

*[[Alfonso X of Castile]] wished to enforce primogeniture by the ''[[Siete Partidas]]'' in the late 1270s and bequeath his crown to [[Alfonso de la Cerda|Alfonso]], the son of his deceased eldest son, [[Ferdinand de la Cerda|Ferdinand]]. His second but eldest surviving son, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho]], rebelled with the support of the nobility and successfully claimed the crown by degree of kinship.{{sfn|Previté-Orton|1975|p=831}}

*In 1307 a dispute erupted over the [[County of Artois]] between [[Mahaut, Countess of Artois|Mahaut]], who had succeeded her father, [[Robert II, Count of Artois|Robert II]], in 1302, and Mahaut's nephew, [[Robert III of Artois|Robert]]. Robert II had outlived his son, [[Philip of Artois|Philip]], and Mahaut put herself forward as "the closest relative to our said father at the time of his death, the reason of propinquity or proximity being notorious in custom". Her nephew, Philip's son, insisted on "representation of our aforesaid father who was the first born of our same grandfather". His appeal was rejected in 1309 on the basis that the established custom of Artois favored Mahaut, but he never relinquished his claim.{{sfn|Wood|1966|p=60}}

*[[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy|Odo IV]], having outlived his son [[Philip I, Count of Auvergne|Philip]], decreed in his will in 1348 that he should be succeeded by his grandson, also named [[Philip I, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]], unless Odo fathered another son. Odo's grandson, however, should have precedence over any daughters Odo might have and over Odo's sisters. In case of Philip's death without issue, the duchy was to pass to Odo's youngest but sole surviving sister, [[Joan the Lame|Joan]], rather than to the descendants of his deceased older sisters.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}} Odo IV had no further sons and was succeeded by his grandson, Philip I. Philip died childless in 1361, having outlived his grandfather's last sibling, Joan. The duchy would have gone to [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of Odo's older sister [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret]], according to primogeniture, but was successfully claimed by [[John II of France]], son of the younger sister Joan, according to proximity of blood. Since Charles was the grandson of a sister of Odo and John was the son of another, the latter was one degree closer to the dukes of Burgundy than Charles.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

*During the reign of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] it was never resolved whether his heir should be his younger sister, [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden|Ulrika Eleonora]], or his nephew, [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Charles Frederick]] (the son of his deceased elder sister, [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden|Hedwig Sophia]]).{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=132, 393}} The sister was more closely related to the reigning king, but the nephew had precedence according to primogeniture.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=371}} Upon Charles XII's death in 1718 it was Ulrika Eleonora who successfully claimed the crown.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=}}

=== Unsuccessful applications ===

*In 1269, upon the death of [[Conrad III of Jerusalem]], [[Mary of Antioch]] and [[Hugh III of Cyprus]] both claimed the crown. She was the daughter of [[Melisende of Lusignan|Melisende]], fifth daughter of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]], while he was the grandson of [[Alice of Champagne|Alice]], second daughter of Isabella I. Mary the only living grandchild of Isabella I and closer in kinship to Conrad III (first cousin twice removed) and the [[kings of Jerusalem]], while Hugh had precedence by [[primogeniture]] but was more distantly related to Conrad III (second cousin) and Isabella I (great-grandchild). The [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] decided in favour of Hugh but Mary did not relinquish her claim.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|p=328-329}}

*[[Alexander III of Scotland]] drafted a treaty in 1281 in which he set out the rules of succession among his descendants. The provisions appeared to favor primogeniture for male heirs but proximity of blood for female heirs; the son of a deceased older son would take precedence over a surviving younger son but a younger daughter over a deceased older daughter's children.{{sfn|Duncan|2002|p=166-169}} Upon the death of his granddaughter and successor, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]], in 1290, the succession was [[Great Cause|unclear]]. [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert de Brus]] claimed the crown by proximity in degree of kinship to the [[kings of Scotland]],{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}} while [[John Balliol]] made a claim based on primogeniture.{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Robert and John were both descended from [[David, Earl of Huntingdon|David of Huntingdon]] (grandson of [[David I of Scotland]]); Robert was a grandson (son of [[Isobel of Huntingdon|Isobel]], second daughter of David of Huntingdon) while John was a great-grandson (grandson of [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Lady of Galloway|Margaret]], first daughter of David of Huntingdon).{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Arbitration by [[Edward I of England]] awarded the throne to John, but Robert's grandson later successfully claimed the crown as [[Robert I of Scotland]].{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}}

Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] before its independence to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, as well as the [[precedent]]s originating from it, as the default law because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state.

All [[US states]] have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the [[common law]] by judicial opinion, but there is [[Reception statute#United States|a special case of partial reception for Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reception of English common law into new colonies and adoption of common law on decolonization==
In ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] described the process by which [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] followed English colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them [[terra nullius|desert and uncultivated]], and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by [[conquest (military)|conquest]], or ceded to us by [[treaty|treaties]]. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force.... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the [[List of British monarchs|king]] may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, if an "uninhabited" or "infidel" territory is colonised by Britain, the English law automatically applies in the territory from the moment of colonisation, but if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively, a form of [[indirect rule]]) until it is formally superseded by the English law by [[Royal Prerogative]], subjected to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

As colonies gained independence from Britain, the newly-independent countries usually adopted [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] [[precedent]] as of the date of independence as the default law to carry forward into the new nation, to the extent that was not explicitly rejected by the founding documents or government.

In some cases, the carry-forward was simply understood, with no express provision in either the new independence constitution or legislation. In other cases, the new legislature preferred to state redundantly but safely that [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] had been received during the colonial period. Examples of both patterns are described below.

== United States ==
After the 1776 [[American Revolution]], one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly-independent states was to adopt a "reception statute" that gave legal effect to the existing body of [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] to the extent that the legislation or the [[constitution]] had not explicitly rejected English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Michigan High Court Ruling Offers Positive Guidance on Challenges to Tort Reform Laws | last1 = Lammi | first1 = Glenn G. | last2 = Chang | first2 = James | date = December 17, 2004 | journal = Legal Backgrounder | publisher = [[Washington Legal Foundation]] | volume = 19 | issue = 46 | issn=1056-3059|url = http://www.wlf.org/upload/121704LBChang.pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted reception statutes as legislative statutes, but other states received the English common law by provisions of their constitution or by court decision. British traditions such as the [[monarchy]] were rejected by the [[US Constitution]], but many English common law traditions such as [[habeas corpus]], [[jury trials]], and various other [[civil liberties]] were adopted in the United States. Significant elements of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States because they have never been rejected by American courts or legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Milestones! 200 Years of American Law: Milestones in Our Legal History''. By Jethro Koller Lieberman. Published by West, 1976. Original from the University of California. Digitized Jun 11, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-519881-2}}, p. 16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=i_2wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the New York Constitution of 1777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ny01.htm New York Constitution of 1777] via Avalon Project at [[Yale]] Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; provides that:
{{quote|[S]uch parts of the common law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great Britain, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the said colony on the 19th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, shall be and continue the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same.}}

[[Alexander Hamilton]] emphasized in the [[Federalist Papers]] that the New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject "to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm Federalist 84] (1788).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]], which was approved by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787, guaranteed "judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law." [[Nathan Dane]], the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed that provision as a default mechanism if federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter. Hr wrote that if "a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law."&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Dane, 6 ''General Abridgment and Digest of American Law'' §182, art. 5, 230 (Cummings, Hilliard &amp; Co. 1823).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories in which no states had yet been established.

Over time, as new states were formed from federal territories, the territorial reception statutes became obsolete and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington states, "The common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington'', [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/9th/case/9835154&amp;exact=1 271 F.3d 835] (9th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state (except for the [[law of Louisiana]] for which some areas of law were received as [[common law]] and others were adopted from French and Spanish sources).

Certain anomalies exist within certain US states because of the effective branching of the law in different directions. For example, the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adopted the [[English common law]] upon becoming independent but before [[England]] abolished [[trial by combat]]. Thus, it has been argued that the right to request trial by combat theoretically still exists in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/trial-by-combat-in-the-united-states-2013-11&lt;/ref&gt; at least as far as a [[form of action]] under which the common law had authorized trial by combat would be available in Virginia.

==Canada==
The Canadian colonies received the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] and English statutes under Blackstone's principles for the establishment of the legal system of a new colony. In five of the ten Canadian provinces, English law was received automatically, under the principle of a settled colony inheriting English law. In the other provinces and in the three territories, reception was governed by reception statutes. The reception of English law occurred long before Canada became fully independent and so reception statutes in Canada were not part of the decolonisation process.

When Canada achieved formal independence with the passage of the [[Canada Act 1982]], no reception statutes were necessary for the decolonialisation process.  English law had already been received in all the various Canadian provinces and territories by legislation and judicial decisions over the previous two centuries.

=== Atlantic provinces ===
In the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador), the reception of English law was automatic, under the principle set out by Blackstone relating to settled colonies. British colonists were considered to have brought English common law and the applicable English statutes with them and so no reception statute was necessary.

The reception date for New Brunswick is 1660, for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 1758, and for Newfoundland and Labrador 1825.

=== Quebec ===
Quebec was settled as a French colony and originally operated under the French civil law system by using the ''Coûtume de Paris''. Upon the transfer of the colony to British control, the British government issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which imposed English common law on the colony under the principle set out in Blackstone relating to captured colonies. However, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]], which restored the French civil law for matters of private law (matters such as contracts, property, and successions (wills)) but kept the English common law as the basis for public law in the colony, notably the criminal law.

With the passage of the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]] in 1866, Quebec's civil law became entirely statute-based and used the civil law system for matters within provincial jurisdiction.

Public law in Quebec continues to have its origin in the common law, but even then, civil law plays a strong role. If federal legislation requires interpretation, judges must look to the Civil Code of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific (1976), [1977] 2 S.C.R 1054; St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 63, [2001] 4 FC 289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario ===
The territory now forming Ontario was originally part of Quebec and so was under the civil law. When Quebec was divided into the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the first Act passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada was to adopt the law of England for all purposes, replacing the civil law.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to repeal certain parts of an Act passed in the Fourteenth Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled an Act for making more effectual Provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec in North America;  and to introduce the English Law, as the Rule of Decision in all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights'', S.U.C. 1792 (32 Geo. III), c. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; That statute adopted both the English common law and English statute law. The foundation for the operation of the common law in Ontario traces back to that reception statute.

=== North-West Territories, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta ===
The new Dominion of Canada acquired the territories of  [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1870. Those territories were considered to have been settled by British colonists and so the reception of English law was automatic. However, the long history of control by the Hudson's Bay Company caused some uncertainty as to the date of reception. To resolve the uncertainty, various statutes were passed to set the date of reception to July 15, 1870, the date of the transfer of those two territories to Canada. The Province of Manitoba set that date for the reception of English law for matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. The Legislature of the North-West Territories passed an ordinance, adopting the same date for matters coming within territorial jurisdiction.

The federal Parliament eventually enacted a provision adopting that date for all matters in the North-West Territories.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/NWT.pdf The North-West Territories Act]'', R.S.C.1885, c. 50, s. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; That provision was carried forward in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan when they were created by the [[Alberta Act]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/aa_1905.html Alberta Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Saskatchewan Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/SK%20Act.pdf Saskatchewan Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 42, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same provision is the basis for the reception date of English law in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.

=== British Columbia ===
British Columbia was considered to be a settled colony and so received English law automatically, under the principle set out by Blackstone.

==Hong Kong==

Hong Kong was ceded (in case of the [[New Territories]], leased) to the United Kingdom by [[Qing dynasty]] of China by a series of treaties, starting with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. As a ceded or leased territory with its own set of laws, the [[Great Qing Legal Code]] remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the late 19th century, a Chinese man convicted of [[murder]] would be executed by [[decapitation]], but an Englishman convicted of the same crime would be sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. It was not until 1971, nearly six decades after the fall of the Qing dynasty, that the of the Qing Code was completely abolished in Hong Kong. Even then, some vestiges of it remain. For example, before the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970 (Cap. 178) came into force on 7 October 1971, a man could practice [[polygamy]] by virtue of the Qing Code. The courts still refer to the Qing Code on the inheritance rights of surviving [[concubinage|concubines]] married before 1971 and that of their children.

When Hong Kong was handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997, Hong Kong retained the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] in a reception statute in Chapter I, Article 8, of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html |title=Chapter I, Section 8 of Hong Kong Basic Law |publisher=Basiclaw.gov.hk |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.}}

==Republic of Ireland==

The 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] stated that pre-existing laws would remain in force except if repugnant to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 73 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] does likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article50_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 50.1 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither explicitly stated whether that meant only the statute law or, more broadly, the common law and [[equity (law)|equity]] as well. The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] has generally taken the broader view.&lt;ref name="Keane2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keane|first=Ronan|title=Equity and the Law of Trusts in the Republic of Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=16 July 2016|year=2011|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667021|pages=22–23, sec.2.39|chapter=The Historical Background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other British colonies==
The pattern was repeated in many other former British colonies as they gained independence from the United Kingdom. [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Belize]] and various Caribbean and African nations have adopted English common law by reception statutes although they do not inevitably continue to copy English common law; later cases can often draw on decisions in other common law jurisdictions. The colony of [[New South Wales]] formally received the English common law in 1828, and each of the other Australian colonies received the common law of New South Wales upon its founding.

A '''wrong''' (from [[Old English]] ''wrang ''– ''crooked'')&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter=crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an act that is illegal or [[immoral]].&lt;ref name="oxdic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Law|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198607563|author=Elizabeth A. Martin|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Legal wrongs''' are usually quite clearly defined in the [[law]] of a [[State (polity)|state]] and/or [[jurisdiction]]. They can be divided into [[civil wrong]]s and [[crime]]s (or ''criminal offences'') in [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries,&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; while [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries tend to have some additional categories, such as [[contraventions]].

'''[[Morality|Moral]] wrong''' is an underlying concept for legal wrong. Some moral wrongs are punishable by law, for example, [[rape]] or [[murder]].&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as parking  offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs.&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt;

==Legal wrong==
In law, a wrong can be a legal [[injury]], which is any damage resulting from a violation of a [[legal right]]. A legal wrong can also imply the state of being contrary to the principles of justice or law. It means that something is contrary to conscience or morality and results in treating others unjustly. If the loss caused by a wrong is minor enough, there is no compensation, which principle is known as ''[[De minimis|de minimis non curat lex]]''. Otherwise, damages apply.

The law of England recognised the concept of a "wrong" before it recognised the distinction between [[civil wrong]]s (governed by [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]]) and [[crime]]s (defined by [[criminal law]]), which distinction was developed during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]], [[A First Book of English Law]], Sweet and Maxwell, 4th ed., 1960, pp. 207, 208, 213&lt;/ref&gt;
