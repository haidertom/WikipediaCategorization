== Early life ==
Andrea Michaels was born in the [[Arbe concentration camp]] (today [[Rab]], [[Croatia]], on the northern shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]]) to Lelja Kauders (b. Zagreb, Yugoslavia, August 25, 1923 – d. Los Angeles California, May 30, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Tributes.com/show/Lelja-Gerson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ben7879&gt;Wright, David, ''Yes You Can! Reaching Your Potential While Achieving Greatness - with Dr. Warren Bennis, Andrea Michaels and Jim Rohn''. Sevierville, Tennessee: Insight Publishing, 2010, pp. 77-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels and her mother, along with her mother's [[Jewish]] parents, Paul (Palvo) Kauders and Elza Ackerman Kauders, escaped in a small boat across the Adriatic to Italy.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; Michaels lived in Italy to the age of four with her grandparents until her mother, who had married an American pilot, sent for her to come live in America.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage ended, and after Michaels arrived in America, her mother married Peter Gerson, who adopted Andrea and moved the family from [[Silverlake, California]], to [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; When Michaels was ten, the family moved to [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt;

An only child Michaels graduated from [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classmates.com/places/school/school/3516/m?startYear=1900&amp;endYear=9999&amp;communityId=3516&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1961 and 1962, transferring to the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA) before marrying Bob Spritz on February 1, 1964.&lt;ref name="ben7879"/&gt; The marriage lasted ten years, and they had a son, Jon (b. July 24, 1970).&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt; After her divorce from Spritz, she changed her last name as well as that of her son's to "Michaels."&lt;ref name=reflect/&gt; Michaels returned to UCLA in 1970 and earned a degree, with honors, in [[Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;2002 Hall of Fame, NAWBOLA.org./About_Us/2002_hof.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Instead of pursuing a career in Psychology, Michaels began working with the Ron Rubin Orchestras in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Maggie, "Spectacular Events Keep Encino Firm in Demand," Features Section, Los Angeles Times, November 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, she became interested in the [[event planning]] business when there was no formalized industry.

The '''Asia Tour''' was planned to be the eleventh concert tour by Canadian singer Celine Dion. The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celines-concert-dates-japan-announced |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142420/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/press/celines-concert-dates-japan-announced |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have marked Dion's first concerts in Asia since the [[Taking Chances World Tour]] in 2008. While Japan and the Philippines were the only confirmed stops of the tour, it has been revealed that the singer was planned to be performing dates in several Asian countries for the very first time.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Background==
The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014. Japan and the Philippines were officially announced. However, there were unofficial dates and venues for Taiwan, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand but because of the cancellation the ticket were never put on sale. In total, 14 concerts were supposed to take place.

==Commercial performance==
Celine's concerts in Tokyo and Osaka sold out immediately after tickets went on sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hipjpn.co.jp/live/celine/ticket.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
On 13 August 2014, Dion has announced that the tour has been cancelled due to ongoing illness and family issues.

According to a statement released by the singer:

{{cquote|"I want to devote every ounce of my strength and energy to my [[René Angélil|husband]]'s healing, and to do so, it's important for me to dedicate this time to him and to our children," Dion said in a statement.
"I also want to apologize to all my fans everywhere, for inconveniencing them, and I thank them so much for their love and support."&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|title=Celine Dion announces show biz hiatus to focus on ailing husband|work=Celine: Las Vegas Official Website|publisher=[[AEG Live]]|accessdate=13 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813231818/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|archive-date=13 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dion did not return to Asia for a performance until her [[Celine Dion Live 2018|2018 tour]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/8455647/celine-dion-2018-asia-tour-dates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening acts==
In the official announcement for the Japan and Philippine tour, it was revealed that the impersonator [[Véronic DiCaire]] had been invited to join Celine as the opening act for these shows.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Set list==
The official setlist had yet to be announced, although in an exclusive video message to her Japanese fans, Dion promised a new show featuring songs from her latest English album, ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', as well as fan favorites from the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dem_HyX9WcY&lt;/ref&gt; Celine was also rehearsing one song in Japanese and one in Mandarin for the tour.

==Outline== 
For the purposes of this summary, it is convenient to divide the chronology of the universe since it [[Cosmogony|originated]], into five parts. It is generally considered meaningless or unclear whether [[time]] existed before this chronology:&lt;!--merely based on the de facto article toc, not binding in any way and can be rearranged along with article structure--&gt;

:'''1. The [[#Very early universe|very early universe]]''' – the first [[picosecond]]&amp;nbsp;(10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of cosmic time. It includes the [[Planck epoch]], during which currently understood [[laws of physics]] may not apply; the emergence in stages of the four known [[fundamental interaction]]s or [[force]]s – first [[gravity]], and later the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] interactions; and the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] and [[supercooling]] of the  still immensely hot universe due to [[cosmic inflation]], which is believed to have been triggered by the separation of the [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]].

:Tiny ripples in the universe at this stage are believed to be the basis of large-scale structures that formed much later. Different stages of the very early universe are understood to different extents.  The earlier parts are beyond the grasp of practical experiments in [[particle physics]] but can be explored through other means.

:'''2. The [[#Early universe|early universe]]''', lasting around 377,000 years. Initially, various kinds of [[subatomic particle]]s are formed in stages. These particles include almost equal amounts of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], so most of it quickly annihilates, leaving a small excess of matter in the universe.

:At about one second,  [[Neutrino decoupling|neutrinos decouple]]; these neutrinos form the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. If [[primordial black hole]]s exist, they are also  formed at about one second of cosmic time.  [[Composite particle|Composite]] [[subatomic particle]]s emerge – including [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s – and from about 3 minutes, conditions are suitable for [[nucleosynthesis]]: around 25% of the protons and all the neutrons  [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[big bang nucleosynthesis|into heavier elements]], mainly [[helium-4]].

:By 20 minutes, the universe is no longer hot enough for fusion, but far too hot for neutral [[atom]]s to exist or [[photon]]s to travel far. It is therefore an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. At around 47,000 years,&lt;ref name="ryden"&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33, 6.41&lt;/ref&gt; as the universe cools, its behavior begins to be dominated by [[matter]] rather than radiation.

:At about 377,000 years {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the universe finally becomes cool enough for neutral [[atom]]s to form ("[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]"), and as a result it also became [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] for the first time. The newly formed atoms – mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with traces of [[lithium]] – quickly reach their lowest energy state ([[ground state]]) by releasing photons ("[[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]"), and these photons can still be detected today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB). This is currently the oldest observation we have of the universe.

:'''3. Dark Ages and large-scale [[structure formation|structure emergence]]''', from 377,000 years until about 1 billion years. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent but the clouds of [[hydrogen]] only collapsed very slowly to form [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], so there were no new sources of light. The only photons (electromagnetic radiation, or "light") in the universe were those released during decoupling (visible today as the [[cosmic microwave background]]) and [[hydrogen line|21 cm radio emissions]] occasionally emitted by hydrogen atoms. The decoupled photons would have filled the universe with a brilliant pale orange glow at first, gradually [[redshift]]ing to non-visible [[wavelength]]s after about 3 million years, leaving it without visible light. This period is known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]].

:Between about 10 and 17 million years the universe's average temperature was suitable for liquid water (273 – 373K) and there has been speculation whether rocky planets or indeed life could have arisen briefly, since statistically a tiny part of the universe could have had different conditions from the rest, and gained warmth from the universe as a whole.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October" /&gt;

:At some point around 400 to 700 million years, the earliest generations of [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies form]], and early large structures gradually emerge, drawn to the foam-like  [[dark matter]] [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] which have already begun to draw together throughout the universe. [[Population III star|The earliest generations of stars]] have not yet been observed astronomically. They may have been huge and [[metallicity|non-metallic]] with very short lifetimes compared to [[Main Sequence|most stars we see today]], so they commonly finish burning their [[hydrogen]] fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years. Other theories suggest that they may have included small stars, some perhaps still burning today. In either case, these early generations of supernovae created most of the everyday [[chemical element|elements]] we see around us today, and seeded the universe with them.

:[[Galaxy cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s emerge over time. At some point, high energy photons from the earliest stars, [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and perhaps [[quasar]]s led to a period of [[reionization]]. The universe gradually transitioned into the universe we see around us today, and the Dark Ages only fully came to an end at about 1 billion years.

:'''4. The universe as it appears today'''. From 1 billion years, and for about 12.8 billions of years, the universe has looked much as it does today. It will continue to appear very similar for many billions of years into the future. The [[thin disk]] of [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] began to form at about 5 billion years (8.8 bn years ago),&lt;ref name=Peloso&gt;{{cite journal |last1=del Peloso |first1=E. F. |last2=da Silva |first2=L. |last3=Porto de Mello |first3=G. F. |last4=Arany-Prado |first4=L. I. |title=The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eunucleocosmochronology. III. Extended sample  |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |date=2005 |volume=440 |issue=3 |pages=1153–1159 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20053307 |bibcode= 2005A&amp;A...440.1153D | arxiv=astro-ph/0506458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|solar system]] formed at about 9.2 billion years (4.6 bn years ago), with the earliest traces of [[timeline of the evolutionary history of life|life]] on Earth emerging by about 10.3 billion years (3.5 bn years ago).

:From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the slowing expansion of space gradually begins to accelerate under the influence of [[dark energy]], which may be a [[scalar field]] throughout our universe. The present-day universe is understood quite well, but beyond about 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years in the future), uncertainties in current knowledge mean that we are less sure which path our universe will take.

:'''5. [[Fate of the universe|The far future]]'''. At some time the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end as stars are no longer being born, and the expansion of the universe will mean that the observable universe becomes limited to local galaxies. There are various scenarios for the far future and [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. More exact knowledge of our current universe will allow these to be better understood.

Earliest stages of chronology shown below (before neutrino decoupling) are an active area of research and based on ideas which are still speculative and subject to modification as scientific knowledge improves.

"Time" column is based on extrapolation of observed [[metric expansion of space]] back in the past. For the earliest stages of chronology this extrapolation may be invalid. To give one example, [[eternal inflation]] theories propose that inflation lasts forever throughout most of the universe, making the notion of "N seconds since Big Bang" ill-defined.

The radiation temperature refers to the [[cosmic background radiation]] and is given by 2.725·(1+''z''), where ''z'' is the [[redshift]].

==Very early universe {{anchor|Very early universe}}==

===Planck epoch===
:''Times shorter than 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ([[Planck time]])''
{{Main|Planck epoch}}

The [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] is an era in traditional (non-inflationary) [[Big Bang|Big Bang cosmology]] immediately after the event which began our known universe. During this epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so inconceivably high compared to any temperature we can observe today, that everyday subatomic particles could not form, and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe—[[electromagnetism]], [[gravitation]], [[weak interaction|weak nuclear interaction]], and [[strong interaction|strong nuclear interaction]]—were combined and formed one fundamental force. Little is understood about physics at this temperature; different hypotheses propose different scenarios. Traditional big bang cosmology predicts a [[gravitational singularity]] before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of [[general relativity]], which is thought to break down for this epoch due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]].

In inflationary models of cosmology, times before the end of inflation (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang) do not follow the same timeline as in traditional big bang cosmology. Models that aim to describe the universe and physics during the Planck epoch are generally speculative and fall under the umbrella of "[[New Physics]]". Examples include the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]],  [[string gas cosmology]], and the [[ekpyrotic universe]].

===Grand unification epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", p. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Grand unification epoch}}

As the universe [[metric expansion of space|expanded]] and cooled, it crossed transition temperatures at which forces separated from each other. These [[phase transition]]s can be visualised as similar to [[condensation]] and [[freezing]] phase transitions of ordinary matter. At certain temperatures/energies, water molecules change their behaviour and structure, and they will behave completely differently. Like steam turning to water, the [[field (physics)|fields]] which define our universe's fundamental forces and particles also completely change their behaviors and structures when the temperature/energy falls below a certain point. This is not apparent in everyday life, because it only happens at much, much, higher temperatures than we usually see in our present universe.

These phase transitions are believed to be caused by a phenomenon of [[quantum field]]s called "[[symmetry breaking]]".

In everyday terms, as the universe cools, it becomes possible for the quantum fields that create the forces and particles around us, to settle at lower energy levels and with higher levels of stability. In doing so, they completely shift how they interact. Forces and interactions arise due to these fields, so the universe can behave very differently above and below a phase transition. For example, in a later epoch, a side effect of one phase transition is that suddenly, many particles that had no mass at all acquire a mass (they begin to interact with the [[Higgs boson]]), and a single  force begins to manifest as two separate forces.

The grand unification epoch began with a phase transitions of this kind, when gravitation separated from the universal combined [[gauge theory|gauge force]]. This caused two forces to now exist: gravity, and an  [[electrostrong interaction]]. There is no hard evidence yet, that such a combined force existed, but many physicists believe it did. The physics of this electrostrong interaction would be described by a so-called [[grand unified theory]] (GUT).

The grand unification epoch ended with a second phase transition, as the electrostrong interaction in turn separated, and began to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak force|electroweak]] interactions.

===Electroweak epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds (or the end of inflation) and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
{{Main|Electroweak epoch}}

Depending on how epochs are defined, and the model being followed, the [[electroweak epoch]] may be considered to start before or after the inflationary epoch. In some models it is described as including the inflationary epoch. In other models, the electroweak epoch is said to begin after the inflationary epoch ended, at roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

According to traditional big bang cosmology, the electroweak epoch began 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, when the temperature of the universe was low enough (10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; K) for the [[Grand Unified Theory|Electronuclear Force]] to begin to manifest as two separate interactions, called the [[strong interaction|strong]] and the [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] interactions. (The electroweak interaction will also separate later, dividing into the [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions). The exact point where electrostrong symmetry was broken is not certain, because of the very high energies of this event.

===Inflationary epoch and the rapid expansion of space===
:''Before ca.  10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Inflationary epoch|Expansion of space}}
At this point, the very early universe [[expansion of space|suddenly and very rapidly expanded]] to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; times its previous volume (and possibly much more). This is equivalent to a linear increase of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; times in every spatial dimension – equivalent to an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length, expanding to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long in a tiny fraction of a second. This change is known as [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]].

Although light and objects within [[spacetime]] cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], in this case it was the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changed in scale. Changes to the metric are not limited by the speed of light.

In some models, it is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition|separation]] of the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electroweak interaction]]s which ended the [[grand unification epoch]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated an enormous repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space itself. Inflation explains several observed properties of the current universe that are otherwise difficult to account for, including explaining how today's universe has ended up so exceedingly [[homogeneous]] (similar) on a very large scale, even though it was highly disordered in its earliest stages.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang.  The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflation field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, as the inflaton field decayed into other particles, known as "reheating". This heating effect led to the universe being repopulated with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]]. In other models, reheating is often considered to mark the start of the [[electroweak epoch]], and some  theories, such as [[warm inflation]], avoid a reheating phase entirely.

In non-traditional versions of Big Bang theory  (known as "inflationary" models), inflation ended at a temperature corresponding to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second after the Big Bang, but this does ''not'' imply that the inflationary era lasted less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. To explain the observed homogeneity of the universe, the duration in these models must be longer than 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; second. Therefore, in inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the ''end'' of inflation. 

After inflation ended, the universe continued to expand, but at a very slow rate. The slow expansion began to speed up after several billion years, believed to be due to [[dark energy]], and is still expanding today.

On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]] which was interpreted as clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317B"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865|work=BICEP2 News|title=Not Even Wrong|date=13 May 2014|first=Peter|last=Woit|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported &lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.

===Electroweak symmetry breaking ===
:''10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Electroweak symmetry breaking}}

As the universe's temperature continued to fall below a certain very high energy level, a third [[symmetry breaking]] occurs. So far as we currently know, it was the final symmetry breaking event in the formation of our universe. It is believed that below some energies unknown yet&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Electroweak interaction ]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak epoch]].

When this happens, it [[electroweak symmetry breaking|breaks electroweak gauge symmetry]]. This has two related effects:

# Via the [[Higgs mechanism]], all [[elementary particle]]s interacting with the Higgs field become massive, having been massless at higher energy levels.
# As a side-effect, the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]], and their respective [[boson]]s (the [[W and Z bosons]] and [[photon]]) now begin to manifest differently in the present universe. Before electroweak symmetry breaking these bosons were all massless particles and interacted over long distances, but at this point the W and Z bosons abruptly become massive particles only interacting over distances smaller than the size of an atom, while the photon remains massless and remains a long-distance interaction.

After electroweak symmetry breaking, the [[fundamental interactions]] we know of – [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] – have all taken their present forms, and fundamental particles have mass, but the temperature of the universe is still too high to allow the formation of many fundamental particles we now see in the universe.

===Supersymmetry breaking (speculative)===
{{Main|Supersymmetry breaking}}

If [[supersymmetry]] is a property of our universe, then it must be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 [[TeV]], the electroweak scale. The masses of particles and their [[superpartner]]s would then no longer be equal.  This very high energy could explain why no superpartners of known particles have ever been observed.

==Early universe{{anchor|Early universe}}==

After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], the remains of reheating. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is much better understood, and the energies involved in the [[Quark epoch]] are directly amenable to [[particle physics|experiment]].

===The quark epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds and 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Quark epoch}}

The [[quark epoch]] began approximately [[Picosecond|10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] after the [[Big Bang]]. This was the period in the evolution of the early universe immediately after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]], when the [[fundamental interaction]]s of [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[strong interaction]] and the [[weak interaction]] had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow [[quark]]s to bind together to form [[hadron]]s.

During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]], containing quarks, [[lepton]]s and their [[antiparticle]]s. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into [[meson]]s or [[baryon]]s.

The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the [[binding energy]] of hadrons.

====Baryogenesis====
{{Main|Baryogenesis}}
{{further|Leptogenesis (physics)}}
''Perhaps by 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baryon]]s are [[subatomic particle]]s such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, that are composed of three [[quark]]s. It would be expected that both baryons, and particles known as [[antimatter|antibaryons]] would have formed in equal numbers. However, this does not seem to be what happened – as far as we know, the universe was left with far more baryons than antibaryons. In fact, almost no antibaryons are observed in nature. It is not clear how this came about. Any explanation for this phenomenon must allow the [[Sakharov conditions]] related to baryogenesis to have been satisfied at some time after the end of [[cosmological inflation]]. Current [[particle physics]] suggests asymmetries under which these conditions would be met, but these asymmetries appear to be too small to account for the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

===Hadron epoch===
:''Between 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; second and 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Hadron epoch}}

The quark–gluon plasma that composes the universe cools until [[hadron]]s, including baryons such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, can form.
Initially, hadron/anti-hadron pairs could form, so [[matter]] and [[anti-matter]] were in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, new hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced, and most of the newly formed hadrons and anti-hadrons [[annihilation|annihilated]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high-energy [[photon]]s. A comparatively small residue of hadrons remained at about 1 second of cosmic time, when this epoch ended. 

Theory predicts that about 1 neutron remained for every 7 protons. We believe this to be correct because, at a later stage, all the neutrons and some of the protons [[nuclear fusion|fused]], leaving [[hydrogen]], a hydrogen [[isotope]] called [[deuterium]], [[helium]] and other elements, which we can measure. A 1:7 ratio of hadrons at the end of this epoch would indeed produce the observed element ratios in the early as well as current universe.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Neutrino decoupling and cosmic neutrino background===
:''Around 1 second after the Big Bang''
{{main|Neutrino decoupling|Cosmic neutrino background}}

At approximately 1 second after the Big Bang [[neutrino]]s [[neutrino decoupling|decouple]] and begin traveling freely through space. As neutrinos rarely interact with matter, these neutrinos still exist today, analogous to the much later [[cosmic microwave background]] emitted during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. The neutrinos from this event have a very low energy, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than is possible with present-day direct detection.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/09/09/cosmic-neutrinos-detected-confirming-the-big-bangs-last-great-prediction Cosmic Neutrinos Detected, Confirming The Big Bang's Last Great Prediction] – ''[[Forbes]]'' coverage of original paper: {{cite journal |last1=Follin |first1=Brent |last2=Knox |first2=Lloyd |last3=Millea |first3=Marius |last4=Pan |first4=Zhen |title=First Detection of the Acoustic Oscillation Phase Shift Expected from the Cosmic Neutrino Background |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=26 August 2015 |volume=115 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.091301|pmid=26371637 |arxiv=1503.07863 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115i1301F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even high energy neutrinos are [[neutrino detector|notoriously difficult to detect]], so this [[cosmic neutrino background]] (CNB) may not be directly observed in detail for many years, if at all.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

However, Big Bang cosmology makes many predictions about the CNB, and there is very strong indirect evidence that the cosmic neutrino background exists, both from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predictions of the helium abundance, and from anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]]. One of these predictions is that neutrinos will have left a subtle imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is well known that the CMB has irregularities. Some of the CMB fluctuations were roughly regularly spaced, because of the effect of [[baryon acoustic oscillations|baryonic acoustic oscillations]]. In theory, the decoupled neutrinos should have had a very slight effect on the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the various CMB fluctuations.&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that such shifts had been detected in the CMB. Moreover, the fluctuations corresponded to neutrinos of almost exactly the temperature predicted by Big Bang theory ({{nowrap|1.96 +/-0.02K}} compared to a prediction of 1.95K), and exactly three types of neutrino, the same number of neutrino flavours currently predicted by the [[Standard Model]].&lt;ref name="forbes_neutrino"/&gt;

=== Possible formation of primordial black holes===
: ''May have occurred within about 1 second after the Big Bang''
[[Primordial black hole]]s are a hypothetical type of [[black hole]] proposed in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zel'dovitch &amp; Novikov|title=The Hypothesis of Cores Retarded During Expansion and the Hot Cosmological Model|journal=Astronomicheskii Zhurnal|date=14 March 1966|volume=10|issue=4|pages=602–603|bibcode=1966AZh....43..758Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may have formed during the so-called ''radiation dominated era'', due to the high densities and inhomogeneous conditions within the first second of cosmic time. Random fluctuations could lead to some regions becoming dense enough to undergo gravitational collapse, forming black holes. Current understandings and theories place tight limits on the abundance and mass of these objects.

Typically, primordial black hole formation requires density contrasts (regional variations in the Universe's density) of around &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho / \rho \sim 0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10%), where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harada |first=T. |last2=Yoo |first2=C.-M. |last3=Khori |first3=K. |year=2013 |title=Threshold of primordial black hole formation |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=88 |issue=8 |pages=084051 |arxiv=1309.4201 |bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88h4051H|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.084051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms could produce dense regions meeting this criterion during the early universe, including reheating, cosmological phase transitions and (in so-called "hybrid inflation models") axion inflation. Since primordial black holes didn't form from stellar [[gravitational collapse]], their masses can be far below stellar mass (~2×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g). [[Stephen Hawking]] calculated in 1971 that primordial black holes could weigh as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;g.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} But they can have any size, so they could also be large, and may have contributed to the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

===Lepton epoch===
:''Between 1 second and 10 seconds after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Lepton epoch}}

The majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilate each other at the end of the hadron epoch, leaving [[lepton]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[muon]]s and certain [[neutrino]]s) and anti-leptons, dominating the mass of the universe. 

The lepton epoch follows a similar path to the earlier hadron epoch. Initially leptons and anti-leptons are produced in pairs. About 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe falls to the point at which new lepton/anti-lepton pairs are no longer created and most remaining leptons and anti-leptons quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, giving rise to pairs of high energy photons, and leaving a small residue of non-annihilated leptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|title=The Timescale of Creation|website=Knowledge tree project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728123714/http://www.knowledgetreeproject.org/beginningweb.htm|archivedate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon epoch===
:''Between 10 seconds and 377,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{Main|Photon epoch}}

After most leptons and anti-leptons are annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, most of the mass-energy in the universe is left in the form of [[photon]]s. (Much of the rest of its mass-energy is in the form of [[neutrino]]s and other [[special relativity|relativistic]] particles{{cn|date=September 2018}}). Therefore the energy of the universe, and its overall behavior, is dominated by its [[photon]]s. These photons continue to interact frequently with charged protons, electrons and (eventually) [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. They continue to do so for about the next 377,000 years.

===Nucleosynthesis of light elements===
:''Between 2 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBNS.html|title=Detailed timeline of Big Bang nucleosynthesis processes|first=Edward L.|last=Wright|date=26 September 2012|website=astro.ucla.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}

Between about 2 and 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature and pressure of the universe allow [[nuclear fusion]] to occur, giving rise to nuclei of a few light [[chemical element|elements]] beyond hydrogen ("[[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]"). About 25% of the protons, and all&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; the neutrons fuse to form [[deuterium]], a hydrogen [[isotope]], and most of the deuterium quickly fuses to form [[helium-4]]. 

Atomic nuclei will easily unbind (break apart) above a certain temperature, related to their [[binding energy]]. From about 2 minutes, the falling temperature means that deuterium no longer unbinds, and is stable,  and starting from about 3 minutes, helium and other elements formed by the fusion of deuterium  also no longer unbind and are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_10/notes44.html|first=Barbara|last=Ryden|date=12 March 2003|title=Astronomy 162 — Lecture 44: The first three minutes|website=astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short duration and falling temperature means that only the simplest and fastest fusion processes can occur. Only tiny amounts of nuclei beyond helium are formed, because [[nucleosynthesis]] of heavier elements is difficult and [[triple-alpha process|requires thousands of years]] even in stars.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HP/article/download/5186/4314|title=The foreground of big bang nucleosynthesis|first=Ravi|last=Karki|journal=The Himalayan Phisics|volume=1|issue=1|date=May 2010|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of [[tritium]] (another hydrogen isotope) and [[beryllium]]-7 and -8 are formed, but these are unstable and are quickly lost again.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; A small amount of deuterium is left unfused because of the very short duration.&lt;ref name="karki_2011"/&gt;

Therefore, the only stable nuclides created by the end of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] are protium (single proton/hydrogen nucleus), deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, and lithium-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.4156 |title = Revised Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with long-lived negatively charged massive particles: Impact of new 6Li limits, primordial 9Be nucleosynthesis, and updated recombination rates |journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume = 214 |issue = 1 |pages = 5 |last1=Kusakabe |first1=Motohiko |display-authors=etal |year = 2014|doi = 10.1088/0067-0049/214/1/5 |bibcode = 2014ApJS..214....5K }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mass, the resulting matter is about 75% hydrogen nuclei, 25% helium nuclei, and perhaps 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; by mass of [[Lithium-7]]. The next most common stable isotopes produced are [[lithium-6]], [[beryllium-9]], [[boron-11]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ("CNO"), but these have predicted abundances of between 5 and 30 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; by mass, making them essentially undetectable and negligible.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/665/1/012001|title = Primordial Nucleosynthesis|journal = Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume = 665|issue = 10102|pages = 012001|year = 2017|last1 = Coc|first1 = A|arxiv = 1609.06048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1403.6694 |title = Standard big bang nucleosynthesis and primordial CNO Abundances after Planck|journal = Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics |volume = 2014|issue = 10|pages = 050|doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2014/10/050|year = 2014|last1 = Coc|first1 = Alain|last2 = Uzan|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last3 = Vangioni|first3 = Elisabeth|bibcode = 2014JCAP...10..050C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amounts of each light element in the early universe can be estimated from old galaxies, and is strong evidence for the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; For example, the Big Bang should produce about 1 neutron for every 7 protons, allowing for 25% of all nucleons to be fused into helium-4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons out of every 16 nucleons), and this is the amount we find today, and far more than can be easily explained by other processes.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Similarly, deuterium fuses extremely easily; any alternative explanation must also explain how conditions existed for deuterium to form, but also left some of that deuterium unfused and not immediately fused again into helium.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt; Any alternative must also explain the proportions of the various light elements and their isotopes. A few isotopes, such as lithium-7, were found to be present in amounts that differed from theory, but over time, these differences have been resolved by better observations.&lt;ref name="karki_2011" /&gt;

===Matter domination===
:''47,000 years after the Big Bang''
{{main|Matter-dominated era}}
Until now, the universe's large scale dynamics and behavior have been determined mainly by radiation – meaning, those constituents that move [[special relativity|relativistically]] (at or near the [[speed of light]]), such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; As the universe cools, from around 47,000 years (z=3600),&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large scale behavior becomes dominated by [[matter]] instead. This occurs because the energy density of matter begins to exceed both the energy density of radiation  and the vacuum energy density.&lt;ref&gt;Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", page 497. Thompson Learning, Inc. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Around or shortly after this time,{{when|date=April 2018}} the densities of non-relativistic matter (atomic nuclei) and relativistic radiation (photons) become equal, the [[Jeans length]], which determines the smallest structures that can form (due to competition between gravitational attraction and pressure effects), begins to fall and perturbations, instead of being wiped out by [[free-streaming]] [[radiation]], can begin to grow in amplitude.

According to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], by this stage, the [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. (However the total matter in the universe is only 31.7%, much smaller than the 68.3% of [[dark energy]]). There is overwhelming evidence that [[dark matter]] exists and dominates our universe, but since the exact nature of dark matter is still not understood, Big Bang theory does not presently cover any stages in its formation.

From this point on, and for several billion years to come, the presence of dark matter accelerates the [[structure formation|formation of structure]] in our universe. In the early universe, dark matter gradually gathers in huge filaments under the effects of [[gravity]]. This amplifies the tiny inhomogeneities (irregularities) in the density of the universe which was left by cosmic inflation. Over time, slightly denser regions become denser and slightly rarefied (emptier) regions become more rarefied. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter.

About 377,000 years after the Big Bang, two connected events occurred: [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Recombination describes the ionized particles combining to form the first  neutral [[atom]]s, and decoupling refers to the [[photon]]s released ("decoupled") as the newly formed atoms settle into more stable energy states.

Just before recombination, the [[baryonic matter]] in the universe was at a temperature where it formed a hot [[plasma (physics)|ionized plasma]]. Most of the photons in the universe interacted with electrons and protons, and could not travel significant distances without interacting with ionized particles. As a result, the universe was opaque or "foggy". Although there was light, it was not possible to see, nor can we observe that light through telescopes.

At around 377,000 years, the universe has cooled to a point where free [[electron]]s can combine with the [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to form neutral atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results | first=G. | last=Hinshaw | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume=180 | issue=2| pages=225–245 | year=2009 | url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/dr3/pub_papers/fiveyear/basic_results/wmap5basic.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 | arxiv=0803.0732 | bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is relatively fast (and faster for the helium than for the hydrogen), and is known as [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhanov, V: "Physical foundations of Cosmology", p. 120, Cambridge 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The name is slightly inaccurate and is given for historical reasons: in fact the electrons and atomic nuclei were combining for the first time.

Directly combining in a low energy state ([[ground state]]) is less efficient, so these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons still in a high energy state, and once combined, the electrons quickly release energy in the form of one or more [[photon]]s as they transition to a low energy state. This release of photons is known as [[Decoupling (cosmology)|photon decoupling]]. Some of these decoupled photons are captured by other hydrogen atoms, the remainder remain free. By the end of recombination, most of the protons in the universe have formed neutral atoms. This change from charged to neutral particles means that the [[mean free path]] photons can travel before capture in effect becomes infinite, so any decoupled photons that have not been captured can travel freely over long distances (see [[Thomson scattering]]). The universe has become transparent to visible [[light]], [[radio wave]]s and other [[electromagnetic radiation]] for the first time in its history.

| The background of this box approximates the original [[Color temperature|4000K color]] of the photons released during decoupling, before they became [[redshift]]ed to form the [[cosmic microwave background]].

|}
The photons released by these newly formed hydrogen atoms initially had a [[Color temperature|temperature/energy of around ~ 4000&amp;nbsp;K]]. This would have been visible to the eye as a pale yellow/orange tinted, or "soft", white color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediacollege.com/lighting/colour/colour-temperature.html|title=Color temperature chart|website=Media college|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over billions of years since decoupling, as the universe has expanded, the photons have been [[red-shift]]ed from visible light to radio waves (microwave radiation corresponding to a temperature of about 2.7&amp;nbsp;K). Red shifting describes the photons acquiring longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency|frequencies]] as the [[metric expansion of space|universe expanded over billions of years]], so that they gradually changed from visible light to radio waves. These same photons can still be detected as radio waves today. They form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"), and they provide crucial evidence of the early universe and how it developed.

Around the same time as recombination, existing [[pressure wave]]s within the electron-baryon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] – known as [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] – became embedded in the distribution of matter as it condensed, giving rise to a very slight preference in distribution of large-scale objects. Therefore, the cosmic microwave background is a picture of the universe at the end of this epoch including the tiny fluctuations generated during [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] (see diagram), and the spread of objects such as galaxies in the universe is an indication of the scale and size of the universe as it developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Quasars illustrate dark energy's roller coaster ride|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20303592|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|21 centimeter radiation}}
After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]], the universe was transparent and had cooled enough to allow light to travel long distances, but there were no light-producing structures such as [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Stars and galaxies are formed when dense regions of gas form due to the action of [[gravity]], and this takes a long time within a near-uniform density of gas and on the scale required, so it is estimated that stars did not exist for perhaps hundreds of millions of years after recombination.

This period, known as the [[Dark Ages (cosmology)|Dark Ages]], began around 377,000 years after the Big Bang. During the Dark Ages, the temperature of the universe cooled from some 4000&amp;nbsp;K down to about 60&amp;nbsp;K, and only two sources of photons existed: the photons released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral hydrogen atoms formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), and photons occasionally released by neutral hydrogen atoms, known as the [[hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line of neutral hydrogen]]. The hydrogen spin line is in the microwave range of frequencies, and within 3 million years,{{cn|date=October 2018}} the CMB photons had [[redshift]]ed out of visible light to [[infrared]]; from that time until the first stars, there were no visible light photons. Other than perhaps some rare statistical anomalies, the universe was truly dark.

The October 2010 discovery of [[UDFy-38135539]], the first observed galaxy to have existed during the following [[reionization]] epoch, gives us a window into these times. The galaxy earliest in this period observed and thus also the most distant galaxy ever observed is currently on the record of Leiden University's Richard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingsworth from UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. They found the galaxy [[UDFj-39546284]] to be at a time some 480 million years after the Big Bang or about halfway through the Cosmic Dark Ages at a distance of about 13.2 billion [[light-years]]. More recently, the [[UDFy-38135539]], [[EGSY8p7]] and [[GN-z11]] galaxies were found to be around 380–550 million years after the Big Bang and at a distance of around 13.4 billion light-years.&lt;ref name="Space-20121212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Ancient Galaxy May Be Most Distant Ever Seen|url=http://www.space.com/18879-hubble-most-distant-galaxy.html |date=December 12, 2012|publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also currently an [[LOFAR|observational effort]] underway to detect the faint 21&amp;nbsp;cm spin line radiation, as it is in principle an even more powerful tool than the cosmic microwave background for studying the early universe.

Structures may have begun to emerge from around 150 million years, and stars and early galaxies gradually emerged from around 400 to 700 million years. As they emerged, the Dark Ages gradually ended. Because this process was gradual, the Dark Ages only fully ended around 1 billion (1000 million) years, as the universe took its present appearance.

:''ca. 10–17 million years after the Big Bang''

For about 6.6 million years, between about 10 to 17 million years after the Big Bang (redshift 137–100), the background temperature was between 373&amp;nbsp;K and 273&amp;nbsp;K, a temperature compatible with [[liquid water]] and common [[biological]] [[chemical reactions]]. [[Avi Loeb|Loeb]] (2014) speculated that [[Abiogenesis|primitive life]] might in principle have appeared during this window, which he called "the Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe".&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9371049&amp;fileId=S1473550414000196 |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|arxiv = 1312.0613 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARXIV-20131202"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |arxiv=1312.0613 |date=December 2013|bibcode = 2014IJAsB..13..337L |doi = 10.1017/S1473550414000196 |citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb argues that carbon-based life might have evolved in a hypothetical pocket of the early universe that was dense enough both to generate at least one massive star that subsequently releases carbon in a supernova, and that was also dense enough to generate a planet. (Such dense pockets, if they existed, would have been extremely rare.) Life would also have required a heat differential, rather than just uniform background radiation; this could be provided by naturally-occurring geothermal energy. Such life would likely have remained primitive; it is highly unlikely that intelligent life would have had sufficient time to evolve before the hypothetical oceans freeze over at the end of the habitable epoch.&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |title=Life possible in the early Universe |url=https://www.nature.com/news/life-possible-in-the-early-universe-1.14341 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |work=Nature |date=10 December 2013 |pages=201–201 |language=en |doi=10.1038/504201a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest structures and stars emerge===
:''Around 150 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang''

[[File:Hubble ultra deep field.jpg|thumb|245px|The [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]s often showcase galaxies from an ancient era that tell us what the early Stelliferous Age was like]]
[[File:Hubble - infant galaxy.jpg|thumb|245px|Another Hubble image shows an infant galaxy forming nearby, which means this happened very recently on the cosmological timescale. This shows that new galaxy formation in the universe is still occurring.]]

The [[matter]] in the universe is around 84.5% [[cold dark matter]] and 15.5% "ordinary" matter. Since the start of the matter-dominated era, the dark matter has gradually been gathering in huge spread out (diffuse) [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] under the effects of [[gravity]]. Ordinary matter eventually gathers together faster than it would otherwise do, because of the presence of these concentrations of dark matter. It is also slightly more dense at regular distances due to early [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) which became embedded into the distribution of matter when photons decoupled. Unlike dark matter, ordinary matter can lose energy by many routes, which means that as it collapses, it can lose the energy which would otherwise hold it apart, and collapse more quickly, and into denser forms. Ordinary matter gathers where dark matter is denser, and in those places it collapses into clouds of mainly hydrogen [[gas cloud|gas]]. The first stars and galaxies form from these clouds. Where numerous galaxies have formed, galaxy clusters and superclusters will eventually arise. Large [[void (cosmology)|voids]] with few stars will develop between them, marking where dark matter became less common.

Structure formation in the big bang model proceeds hierarchically, due to [[gravitational collapse]], with smaller structures forming before larger ones. The earliest structures to form are the first stars (known as [[population III stars]]), [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]], and [[quasar]]s (which are thought to be bright, early [[active galaxies]] containing a [[supermassive black hole]] surrounded by a inward-spiralling [[accretion disk]] of gas). Before this epoch, the evolution of the universe could be understood through linear cosmological [[perturbation theory]]: that is, all structures could be understood as small deviations from a perfect homogeneous universe. This is computationally relatively easy to study. At this point non-linear structures begin to form, and the [[computational problem]] becomes much more difficult, involving, for example, [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulation]]s with billions of particles. The [[Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation]] is a high precision simulation of this era.

These Population III stars are also responsible for turning the few light elements that were formed in the Big Bang (hydrogen, helium and small amounts of lithium) into many heavier elements. They can be huge as well as perhaps small – and non-[[metallicity|metallic]] (no elements except hydrogen and helium). The larger stars have very short lifetimes compared to most Main Sequence stars we see today, so they commonly finish burning their hydrogen fuel and explode as [[supernova]]e after mere millions of years, seeding the universe with heavier elements over repeated generations. They mark the start of the [[Stelliferous era|Stelliferous (starry) era]].

As yet, no Population III stars have been found, so our understanding of them is based on [[computational model]]s of their formation and evolution.  Fortunately, observations of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] radiation can be used to date when star formation began in earnest.  Analysis of such observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck telescope in 2016 concluded that the first generation of stars formed 700 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/planck-first-stars-formed-later-than-we-thought ''Planck: First Stars Formed Later Than We Thought''; NASA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quasar]]s provides some additional evidence of early structure formation. Their light shows evidence of elements such as [[carbon]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[oxygen]]. This is evidence that by the time quasars formed, a massive phase of [[star formation]] had already taken place, including sufficient generations of [[population III stars]] to give rise to these elements.

=== Reionization===
{{See also|Reionization|Dwarf galaxy|Quasar}}
As the [[population III star|first stars]], [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s gradually form, the intense radiation they emit reionizes much of the surrounding universe; splitting the neutral hydrogen atoms back into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of free [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s for the first time since [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]].

Reionization is evidenced from observations of [[quasar]]s. Quasars are a form of [[active galaxy]], and the most luminous objects observed in the universe. Electrons in neutral hydrogen have a specific patterns of absorbing photons, related to electron energy levels and called the [[Lyman series]]. Ionized hydrogen does not have electron energy levels of this kind. Therefore, light travelling through ionized hydrogen and neutral hydrogen shows different absorption lines. In addition, the light will have travelled for billions of years to reach us, so any absorption by neutral hydrogen will have been redshifted by varied amounts, rather than by one specific amount, indicating when it happened. These features make it possible to study the state of ionization at many different times in the past. They show that reionization began as "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen which became larger over time.&lt;ref name="dijkstra"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lyα Emitting Galaxies as a Probe of Reionization|date=5 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Dijkstra|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|doi=10.1017/pasa.2014.33|volume=31|arxiv = 1406.7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show that the absorption was due to the general state of the universe (the [[intergalactic medium]]) and not due to passing through galaxies or other dense areas.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt; Reionization might have started as early as ''z''=16 (250 million years of cosmic time) and was complete by around ''z''=9 or 10 (500 million years). The epoch of reionization probably ended by around ''z''=5 or 6 (1 billion years) as the era of Population III stars and quasars – and their intense radiation – came to an end, and the ionized hydrogen gradually reverted to neutral atoms.&lt;ref name="dijkstra" /&gt;

These observations have narrowed down the period of time during which reionization took place, but the source of the photons that caused reionization is still not completely certain. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to [[ultraviolet]] photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter, implying that the sources must have produced significant amount of ultraviolet and higher energy. Protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart, which also sets limits on how numerous the sources were and their longevity.&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

However, by this time, matter had become far more spread out due to the ongoing expansion of the universe. Although the neutral hydrogen atoms were again ionized, the plasma was much more thin and diffuse, and photons were much less likely to be scattered. Despite being reionized, the universe remained largely transparent during reionization. As the universe continued to cool and expand, reionization gradually ended.

Matter continues to draw together under the influence of [[gravity]], to form [[galaxy|galaxies]]. The stars from this time period, known as  [[Stellar population|Population II]] stars, are formed early on in this process, with more recent [[Stellar population|Population I]] stars formed later. Gravitational attraction also gradually pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, [[galactic cluster|cluster]]s and [[supercluster]]s.

== Current appearance of the Universe==

The universe has appeared much the same as it does now, for many billions of years. It will continue to look similar for many more billions of years into the future.

Based upon the emerging science of [[nucleocosmochronology]], the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have been formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Peloso/&gt;

=== Dark energy dominated era===
{{main|dark energy|Scale factor (cosmology)}}
:''From about 9.8 billion years after the Big bang''
From about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time,&lt;ref name="ryden" /&gt; the universe's large-scale behavior is believed to have gradually changed for the third time in its history. Its behavior had originally been dominated by radiation ([[special relativity|relativistic]] constituents such as photons and neutrinos) for the first 47,000 years, and since about 377,000 years of cosmic time, its behavior had been dominated by [[matter]]. During its matter-dominated era, the expansion of the universe had begun to slow down, as [[gravity]] reigned in the initial outward expansion. But from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, observations show that that the expansion of the universe slowly stops decelerating, and gradually begins to accelerate again, instead. 

While the precise cause is not known, the observation is accepted as correct by the cosmologist community. By far the most accepted understanding is that this is due to an unknown form of energy which has been given the name "[[dark energy]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The cosmological constant and dark energy|year=2003|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=astro-ph/0207347|volume=75|issue=2|pages=559–606|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.559|bibcode=2003RvMP...75..559P|last1=Peebles|first1=P.

Research is ongoing to understand this dark energy. Dark energy is now believed to be the single largest component of the universe, as it constitutes about 68.3% of the entire [[mass-energy]] of the physical universe.

Dark energy is believed to act like a [[cosmological constant]] - a [[scalar field]] that exists throughout space. Unlike gravity, the effects of such a field do not diminish (or only diminish slowly) as the universe grows. While matter and gravity have a greater effect initially, their effect quickly diminishes as the universe continues to expand. Objects in the universe, which are initially seen to be moving apart as the universe expands, continue to move apart, but their outward motion gradually slows down. This slowing effect becomes smaller as the universe becomes more spread out. Eventually, the outward and repulsive effect of dark energy begins to dominate over the inward pull of gravity. Instead of slowing down and perhaps beginning to move inward under the influence of gravity, from about 9.8 billion years of cosmic time, the expansion of space starts to slowly accelerate ''outward'' at a gradually ''increasing'' rate.

==Far future and ultimate fate==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe|Timeline of the far future}}
{{further|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe}}

The universe has existed for around 13.8 billion years, and we believe that we understand it well enough to predict its large-scale development for many billions of years into the future – perhaps as much as 100 billion years of cosmic time (about 86 billion years from now). Beyond that, we need to better understand the universe to make any accurate predictions. Therefore, the universe could follow a variety of different paths beyond this time.

There are several competing scenarios for the possible long-term evolution of the universe. Which of them will happen, if any, depends on the precise values of [[physical constant]]s such as the [[cosmological constant]], the possibility of [[proton decay]], the [[False vacuum|energy of the vacuum]] (meaning, the energy of [[Vacuum state|"empty" space]] itself), and the natural laws [[beyond the Standard Model]].

If the expansion of the universe continues and it stays in its present form, eventually all but the nearest galaxies will be carried away from us by the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] at such a velocity that our [[observable universe]] will be limited to [[Laniakea Supercluster|our own]] gravitationally bound local [[galactic cluster]]. In the very long term (after many trillions – thousands of billions – of years, cosmic time), the [[Stelliferous Era]] will end, as stars cease to be born and even the [[red dwarf star|longest-lived stars]] gradually die. Beyond this, all objects in the universe will cool and (with the [[proton decay|possible exception of protons]]) gradually decompose back to their constituent particles and then into subatomic particles and very low level photons and other [[fundamental particle]]s, by a variety of possible processes. But this will take a duration of time that is almost inconceivable to most people, compared to which the entire 13.8 billion years of the universe would be a tiny instant in time.

Ultimately, in the extreme future, the following scenarios have been proposed for the ultimate fate of the universe.

This will happen only after an extremely long time because first, all matter will collapse into [[black hole]]s, which will then evaporate extremely slowly via [[Hawking radiation]].

| '''[[Big Rip]]'''
| Expansion of space accelerates and at some point becomes so extreme that even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] are pulled apart and unable to exist.
| For sufficiently large values for the [[dark energy]] content of the universe, the expansion rate of the universe will continue to increase without limit. Gravitationally bound systems, such as clusters of galaxies, galaxies, and ultimately the Solar System will be torn apart. Eventually the expansion will be so rapid as to overcome the electromagnetic forces holding molecules and atoms together. Even atomic nuclei will be torn apart. Finally, forces and interactions even on the [[Planck scale]] – the smallest size for which the notion of "space" currently has a meaning – will no longer be able to occur as the fabric of [[spacetime]] itself is pulled apart and the universe as we know it will end in an unusual kind of singularity.
|-
| '''[[Big Crunch]]'''
| Expansion eventually slows and halts, then reverses as all matter accelerates towards its common centre. Not now considered likely.
| In the opposite of the "Big Rip" scenario, the [[metric expansion of space]] would at some point be reversed and the universe would contract towards a hot, dense state. This is a required element of [[oscillatory universe]] scenarios, such as the [[cyclic model]], although a Big Crunch does not necessarily imply an oscillatory universe. Current observations suggest that this model of the universe is unlikely to be correct, and the expansion will continue or even accelerate.
|-
| '''[[Vacuum instability]]'''
| Collapse of the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, to a different form.
| Cosmology traditionally has assumed a stable or at least  [[metastability|metastable]] universe, but the possibility of a [[false vacuum]] in [[quantum field theory]] implies that the universe at any point in spacetime might spontaneously collapse into a lower energy state (see [[Bubble nucleation]]), a more stable or "true vacuum", which would then expand outward from that point with the speed of light.&lt;ref name="turnerwilczek"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is our vacuum metastable? |journal=Nature |volume=298 |date=1982 |issue=5875 |pages=633–634 |doi=10.1038/298633a0 |bibcode=1982Natur.298..633T |url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/%2872%29vacuum_metastable.pdf |access-date=2015-10-31|last1=Turner |first1=M.

H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect would be that the [[quantum field]]s that  underpin all forces, particles and structures, would undergo a transition to a more stable form. New forces and particles would replace the present ones we know of, with the side effect that all current particles, forces and structures would be destroyed and subsequently (if able) reform into different particles, forces and structures.

In this kind of extreme timescale, extremely rare [[quantum mechanics|quantum phenomena]] may also occur that are extremely unlikely to be seen on a timescale smaller than trillions of years. These may also lead to unpredictable changes to the state of the universe which would not be likely to be significant on any smaller timescale. For example, on a timescale of millions of trillions of years, [[black hole]]s might appear to evaporate almost instantly, uncommon [[quantum tunneling]] phenomena would appear to be common, and quantum (or other) phenomena so unlikely that they might occur just once in a trillion years may occur many times.

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

[[File:Post-and-Grant-Avenue-Look.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], remembered as one of the worst [[natural disaster]]s in the history of the [[United States]].]]

A '''disaster''' is a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.&lt;ref name="ifrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=What is a disaster?|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/|website=www.ifrc.org|publisher=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHA"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=March 2002 |title=Disasters &amp; Emergencies: Definitions |url=http://apps.who.int/disasters/repo/7656.pdf |language=en-GB-oxendict|location=[[Addis Ababa]]|publisher=Emergency Humanitarian Action |access-date=2017-11-26 |via=World Health Organization International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately [[risk management|managed risk]]. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.&lt;ref name=quarantelli&gt;Quarantelli E.L. (editor) "Where We Have Been and Where We Might Go", ''What is a Disaster?: A Dozen Perspectives on the Question'', London, Routledge, 1 edition 1998, pp.146–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits&amp;nbsp;– more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of [[GDP]]) in [[developing countries]] than in [[industrialized countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTDISMGMT/0,,menuPK:341021~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:341015,00.html|title= World Bank: Disaster Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. [http://54pesos.org/2008/10/04/who%e2%80%99s-getting-the-worst-of-natural-disasters/ "Who’s getting the worst of natural disasters?"] 54Pesos.org, 4 October 2008  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903043315/http://54pesos.org/2008/10/04/who%E2%80%99s-getting-the-worst-of-natural-disasters |date=3 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''disaster'' is derived from Middle [[French language|French]] ''désastre'' and that from Old [[Italian language|Italian]] ''disastro'', which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[pejorative]] prefix δυσ-, (''dus-'') "bad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328613|title= Dus, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀστήρ (''aster''), "star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2316528|title= Aster, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word ''disaster'' ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an [[astrology|astrological]] sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=disaster "Disaster"] in Etymology online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
Researchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years [[disaster research]]. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.&lt;ref name=atrisk&gt;Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis &amp; Ben Wisner. ''At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters'', Wiltshire: Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in [[developing country|developing countries]]. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]].

===Natural disaster===
{{Main article| Natural disaster}}

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]], floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[Landform|landforms]], coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]]. [[Asia]] tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.
[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]

===Man-made disasters===
{{Main article|Anthropogenic hazard}}
Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened—for instance, terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event.

'''Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga''' was a planned co-headlining [[concert tour]] by American rapper [[Kanye West]] and singer [[Lady Gaga]]. For the tour, which would have supported West's fourth album ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008) and Gaga's ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' EP (2009), the pair conceived a production that would unite their different musical audiences. The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|West's interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s Best Female Video speech at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while West took a break from his career.

==Background and development==
[[File:LadyGaga-EqualityMarch-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga only agreed to tour with West under the condition that everything "remain gay".]]
In June 2009, West announced on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' he would be touring with Gaga, but she would not perform as an opening act. "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. "We're doing it together, with no opening act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West To Tour With Lady Gaga|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210202610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618664/20090813/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Groundbreaking' Tour With Kanye West|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her [[gay]] fans. "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to ''remain'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|title=The Lady Is a Vamp|last=Stein|first=Joshua David|author2=Michelson, Noah|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|publisher=Joe Landry|page=2|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102723/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour's stage was designed by Gaga and West as a [[wiktionary:traverse|traverse]]; "Instead of being on just one end of the arena, the stage traverses the entire arena", Gaga noted. "It's not really in-the-round; it's more of a runway." The concept of the tour was to feature the performers on opposite ends of the stage, with Gaga's end representing "home and humble beginnings" and West's end representing "the fame", with the two fighting for each other's positions throughout the show. West would perform his singles, Gaga would perform hers, and then the duo would perform several duets.&lt;ref name="Aswad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West/ Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled|last=Aswad|first=Jem|author2=Dinh, James|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=MTV News.

Gaga said she enjoyed designing Fame Kills with West, calling themselves "creative kindreds."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"/&gt; She explained that they did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] means", she said. "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.&lt;ref name="Aswad"/&gt;

A promotional video for the tour was released in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had "no idea what [the text in the video] has to do with the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch."&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-gets-nsfw-in-promo-for-joint-tour-with-kanye-west-20090923|title=Lady Gaga Gets NSFW in Promo For Joint Tour With Kanye West|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 23, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|title=Nude Lady GaGa 'Fame Kills' tour promo released|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2014|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091358/http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyecolorconcert.jpg|thumb|West ''(pictured)'' was criticized for his interruption of [[Taylor Swift]]'s VMA speech. The incident reportedly put the fate of the Fame Kills tour in question.]]
Following singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s win for the music video "[[You Belong with Me]]" at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and declared that singer [[Beyoncé]] deserved the award for her "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" video. He declared, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|title=Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's VMAs moment: What was he thinking?|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=September 13, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4qjZcIO?url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/09/14/kanye.west.reaction/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Anger over West's disruption at MTV awards|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]]. [[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from a US urban radio station commented: "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour&amp;nbsp;— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|title=Will Kanye West's VMAs Outburst Hurt His Upcoming Tour?|last=Conception|first=Mariel|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716062129/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|archivedate=July 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.&lt;ref name="Canceled"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West Cancel 'Fame Kills' Tour|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 29, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202205432/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various rumors circulated as to why the tour was canceled. It was suspected that it was canceled due to poor ticket sales, feuding between Gaga and West's management teams, and Gaga's desire to play in smaller venues. Gaga's choreographer, [[Laurieann Gibson]], said the tour was terminated due to "creative differences" between the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West's "Fame Kills" Tour Killed By Poor Sales?|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 2, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109011526/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga claimed that the cancellation was a mutual decision, and added that she would soon embark on her own headlining tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]] in the coming weeks, while West would be taking a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|title=Lady Gaga Speaks: Solo Tour Soon, Kanye Taking Time Off|last=Prince|first=David J.|author2=Concepcion, Mariel|date=October 2, 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412053639/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, West claimed that Gaga had been solely responsible for canceling the tour following the MTV incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|title=Kanye West Talks Why His Joint Tour With Lady Gaga Was Canceled (Hint: Taylor Swift)|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=April 11, 2016|work=Idolator|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616140319/http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">A '''farewell speech''' or '''farewell address''' is a speech given by an individual leaving a position or place. They are often used by public figures such as politicians as a to the preceding career, or as statements delivered by persons relating to reasons for their leaving. The term is often used as a euphemism for "retirement speech", though it is broader in that it may include geographical or even biological conclusion. In the [[Classics]], a term for a dignified and poetic farewell speech is ''apobaterion'' (ἀποβατήριον), standing opposed to the ''epibaterion'', the corresponding speech made upon arrival.

== U.S. presidential farewell addresses ==
Many U.S. presidential speeches have been given the moniker "farewell address" since George Washington's address in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4624166/presidential-farewell-addresses/|title=Barack Obama's Farewell Address and 6 Other Memorable Presidential Goodbyes|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable examples:

* [[George Washington]] – [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] where he warned of the dangers of [[Political party|political parties]] and [[Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances|foreign alliances]].

*[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] – [[Eisenhower's farewell address]] where he warned of the [[military–industrial complex]].
*[[Barack Obama]] – [[Barack Obama's farewell address|Obama's farewell address]] made from Chicago, breaking tradition of holding one in the White House.

==Other notable farewell speeches==

*The speech of [[Aeneas]] to [[Helenus]] and [[Andromache]], ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book III.
*[[Robert E. Lee]] – [[Lee's Farewell Address]] to the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] the day after the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].
*[[Douglas MacArthur]] – farewell speeches before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]]; "[[Wikisource:MacArthur's Farewell Speech to Congress|old soldiers never die, they only fade away]]" and "[[Wikisource:Duty, honor, country|duty, honor, country]]".

'''Global Night Commute''' was a worldwide event organized by the makers of the film ''[[Invisible Children]]'' through the organization [[Invisible Children, Inc.]] It took place on April 29, 2006. Youths from around the world walked to city centers and spent the night in parks to show support for [[Ugandan]] children who walk every night into city centers attempting to avoid capture by the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA).

== Overview ==
These children, between the ages of 3 and 17, from [[Acholiland]] in Northern Uganda, are referred to as "night commuters". They walk up to 20&amp;nbsp;km (12&amp;nbsp;mi) from [[internally displaced person]] camps to larger towns, notably [[Gulu]], in search of safety from the LRA.

The Global Night Commute was similar to other initiatives raising awareness about the plight of the children in Acholiland like the [[Gulu Walk]] that took place in over 40 cities internationally in October 2005; however, the Global Night Commute took place on a much larger scale. Over 58,000 people signed up to participate in the event, but over 80,000 attended in total; it took place in 130 cities in seven countries.&lt;ref name=gnc&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Night Commute |url=http://www.invisiblechildren.com/theMovement/globalNightCommute/ |accessdate=2006-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425060858/http://www.invisiblechildren.com/theMovement/globalNightCommute/ |archivedate=2006-04-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the event was to raise awareness and ultimately end Africa's longest running conflict by facilitating a change in the policies of the United States government.  The slogan for the event is "On April 29th, we gathered. To make a difference. To end a war."

'''Global Wind Day''' is a [[international observance|worldwide event]] that occurs annually on [[15 June]].  It is organised by EWEA ([[European Wind Energy Association]]) and GWEC ([[Global Wind Energy Council]]).
&lt;ref&gt;[http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102949362881&amp;ca=e882c25a-f468-49fe-b235-801f5a25f67a GWEC Media Release: The local impact of wind energy in the spotlight on Global Wind Day]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a day when [[wind power|wind energy]] is celebrated, information is exchanged and adults and children find out about wind energy, its power and the possibilities it holds to change the world. 
In association with EWEA and GWEC, national wind energy associations and companies involved in wind energy production organise events in many countries around the world. In 2011, there were events organised in 30 countries, on 4 continents. Events included visits to onshore and offshore wind farms, information campaigns, demonstration turbines being set up in cities, wind workshops and a wind parade. Many events happened on Global Wind Day (15 June) itself, but there were also events on the days and weeks before and afterwards. In 2012 there were 250 events around the globe and a very popular photo competition.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==2007==
The inaugural year of Wind Day (it did not become Global Wind Day until 2009) was organised by EWEA. The main idea was to coordinate events organised by national wind energy associations and companies active in the wind energy field. Wind Day in 2007 reached 18 countries in Europe, with a participation of around 35,000 people.

==2008==
Wind Day 2008 reached 20 European countries and attracted 100,000 people.

==2009==
This was the first year that EWEA joined forces with GWEC and extended the reach from European wind energy associations and companies to coordinate Wind Day events across the globe (and changing the name to Global Wind Day). In 2009 there were 300 events in 35 countries, reaching 1 million people.

In 2009 in Portugal the Wind Day was celebrated with an event called Wind Parade. It was organised in the city of Cascais just in front of the ocean. This project aimed to promote renewable energy good practices and in particular Wind Energy. It was supported by the City Council and conceived by Energia Lateral and implied the installation of 7 skstream micro wind turbines in a very visible place by the sea in June–July 9. One of the purposes was to involve children in the event and they were invited for a contest to decorate/paint small dummy wind turbines. Over 50 applications were submitted by 30 schools. The winner decorated a dummy wind turbine with Don Quixote elements comparing his fight against the windmills but in this case the wind mills being allies of Don Quixote in an epic effort to improve the environment.

==2010==
In this year, 220 events took place in 30 countries, including the display of a 29.5 metre (96.7&amp;nbsp;ft) wind turbine blade in Brussels, Belgium, next to the main building of the [[European Commission]] and [[European Council]]. More than 1 million people were reached by Global Wind Day communications around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/topics/m/video/56693102/global-wind-day-2010.htm|title=Global Wind Day 2010|date=2010-06-15|publisher=renewableenergyworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Global Wind Day Wind Parade.jpg|thumb|Global Wind Day Wind Parade, Brussels 2011]] --&gt;

In [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], the home of EWEA and GWEC, a wind parade in [[Place de Luxembourg]] educated people working in the [[European Union|EU]] area on the benefits and importance of wind energy.

Global Wind Day events happened in 30 countries around the world in 2011. Some examples include:
In [[France]] there were 15 events, ranging from wind farm inauguration to a jobs-in-the-wind-industry question and answer session. 
In [[Austria]], journalists leapt from the top of a turbine and abseiled to the ground. 
In [[Japan]] there were 10 events, involving field trips to wind farms, experimental wind energy facilities and making wind turbines from a kit. 
In [[Australia]], an open day at a wind farm was available, with a community evening to finish off the day. 
In [[Mexico]], a public street fair featured a drawing competition for kids and a display of wind energy history.

==2012==

Global Wind Day partners organised 250 events around the globe in 2012, from wind farm open days to workshops, from
photo exhibition to regattas, from kite-flying to charity runs. For the first time, this included events in
[[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]] and [[South Africa]].
Global Wind Day 2012 gained the support of 18 GWD Ambassadors,who were joined by the Danish Presidency of the EU and the United Nations. Kandeh K. Yumkella, the Director-General of the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), and the leader of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative said, ‘We need to double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. This can be achieved with significant contribution from wind energy, both grid connected andfor small-scale decentralised systems. The ‘Global Wind Day’ on 15 June, does play a central role in contributing to the UNSG’s Sustainable Energy For All initiative through galvanising the much needed support for the wind energy industry from political leaders around the globe’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalwindday.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GWD_report_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The ‘Wind in Mind’ photo competition saw 2,300 photos from over 40 countries submitted.

==2018==
For 2018, WindEurope and GWEC launched a global photo competition to capture the power of wind in the run up to Global Wind Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalwindday.org/photo-competition/ Global Wind Day Photo Competition “Wind Vision” 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalwindday.org/wind-vision-photo-competition-winners/ Wind Vision Photo Competition Winners (in all 3 categories)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Golden Checkerboard''''' (1965) is a book by [[Ed Ainsworth]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Edward Maddin Ainsworth worked for 35 years as a columnist, feature writer and editor for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Other books by him include ''Pot Luck'' (1940), ''Eagles Fly West'' (1946), ''California Jubilee'' (1948), ''Bill Magee's Western Barbecue Cookbook'' (1949), ''Death Cues the Pageant'' (1954) New York, Arcadia House {{oclc|3117808}}, ''Painters of the Desert'' (1961), ''Beckoning Desert'' (1962) Prentice-Hall {{oclc|64311285}}, ''The Cowboy in Art'' (1968) New York, World Publishing {{oclc|443225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its subject matter concerns the mid-20th century economic conditions of the [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] of [[Palm Springs, California]], and the history of the 99-year lease law which enabled them to commercially develop tribal owned lands. It focuses on Indio [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court]] Judge Hilton McCabe, who is described as "The Little White Father of the Indians of Palm Springs",&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ainsworth|first=Ed |title=Golden Checkerboard|year=1965|publisher=Desert-Southwest|location=Palm Desert, CA|pages=195|lccn=66000811|oclc=4391736

The title of the book refers to the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians' [[Indian Reservation|reservation]] [[Checkerboarding (land)|checkerboard pattern]], originating from [[Land grants#United States|land grants]] to the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] as an incentive to build rail lines through the region,&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|29}} when President Ulysses S.

==Historical context==
Section 14, which included the warm springs at the center of Palm Springs, and other sections surrounding Palm Springs, were "owned" by the Indians, but held "in trust" by the federal government; the Indians charged fees for bathing in the springs and picnicking in the canyon.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Chris|title=African-Americans Shaping the California Desert: Coachella Valley|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/african-americans-shaping-the-california-desert-coachella-valley.html|work=SOCAL Focus|publisher=KCET (Community Television of Southern California)|accessdate=March 19, 2012|date=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Congress passed the Allotment Act (39 Stat. 969, 976)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In fact the original General Allotment Act was the [[Dawes Act]], passed in 1887.

Wadsworth was appointed as the allotting agent.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|65}} In 1927, the Secretary instructed Wadsworth to make a new schedule of allotments, which he did for the 24 members of the Band who made written applications.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|67}} (In fact the allotments were not carried out; Band member Lee Arenas sued the federal government to have the allotments made legal and won his case in the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accmuseum.org/Arenas-Street Aqua Caliente Cultural Museum: Lee Arenas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arenas v.

Chief Francisco Patencio was active in opposing the allotments and loss of tribal authority, traveling to Washington, D.C., to meet with Office of Indian Affairs Commissioner John Collier. [http://www.accmuseum.org/Patencio-Road Aqua Caliente Cultural Museum: Francisco Patencio]&lt;/ref&gt;) In December 1944, Secretary of the Interior [[Oscar L. Chapman|Oscar Chapman]], acting on the advice of Commissioner of Indian Affairs [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], disapproved the allotting schedule set up by Wadsworth 17 years earlier.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|86}}

==Conservatorship program==

===Odlum Report===
In January 1953, [[Douglas McKay]] became [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Thereafter McKay asked industrialist [[Floyd B. Odlum]] (former president of Atlas Corp. and husband of [[Jacqueline Cochran]]) to investigate the affairs of the Agua Caliente Indians.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|124}} The report by Odlum's committee was completed in April 1955 and put into final form in April 1956. Among other things, Odlum's report determined: that the Band consisted of 83 persons, the majority of whom were minors; the value of the Indian land, allotted and unallotted, totaled as much as $12,000,000; and the value of the land could increase with proper development. Odlum also discussed the legal problems related to unequal allotments, taxes on non-productive real estate, the inability to lease land because of a 5-year limit, and conflicting claims of the allottees.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|127–8}} The report recommended that the Indian land be placed in a private corporation or trusteeship rather than existing wardship.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|129–30}} Odlum's recommendations were not implemented because newly elected Congressman [[Dalip Singh Saund]], who ran against Cochran in a bitter election campaign, blocked proposed legislation.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|132}} In the meantime, Congress passed Public Law No. 255 in August 1955, which allowed for leases of 50 years.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|138}}

===1959 legislation===&lt;!--subject to more editing. McCabe's papers (which are referenced below) are not readily available. Ainsworth's book is poorly organized, lacking an index or TOC. The "landmark decision" is probably related to the Equalization Act.--&gt;
In 1959, a landmark decision by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] equalized allotted Indian lands, thereby setting the stage for development of Indian lands within the city of Palm Springs. This same legislation, however, recognizing the potential value of Indian lands within the boundaries of a world-famous resort, also called for the appointment of conservators and guardians to "protect" Indians and their estates from "artful and designing persons"&lt;ref name="LandProblems"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/finding_aids/records/finding_aid.php?fa=0018 USC Libraries; Archival Collections: Judge Hilton McCabe Collection on the Agua Caliente Indians] containing unpublished manuscript of ''Land Problems and Solutions of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians'' (1961), Hilton McCabe, Indio Superior Court.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/directory/profile/usc_dml_rare_books_and_manuscripts USC Doheny Memorial Library: Rare Books and Manuscripts]&lt;/ref&gt; who might otherwise cheat them out of their properties, which could now be legally sold by the individual tribal members who owned them. By declaring Indians as "incompetent" (both as children and adults) court-appointed conservators and guardians took control of a majority of Indian estates. A major oversight of the program was the appointment of judges, lawyers, and business people as Indian conservators and guardians—the very people the program sought to protect Indians and their estates from. The program was administered by the Indio Superior Court's Judge Hilton McCabe, subject of ''Golden Checkerboard''. McCabe concurrently acted as a conservator to a number of tribal members and an [[executor]], in addition to his administrative and legal roles.&lt;ref name="CoxReport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Administration of Guardianships and Conservatorships Established for Members of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians, California|date=March 1968|publisher=Department of the Interior|location=Washington, DC|pages=56|url=|author=Palm Springs Task Force (Cox Report)|oclc=8536472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As a result of the conservatorship program the Band was able to lease land to businesses. The Spa Hotel opened in November 1962, with Eileen Miguel, head of the Band, U.S. Grant IV, great-grandson of President Grant, and McCabe at the opening ceremony. In 1961, 41 members of the Band signed a petition to McCabe thanking him for his efforts. {{Cite book

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

'''Danny Hugh Freeze Jr.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicholls coaching search nets 42 applicants |url=http://www.houmatoday.com/news/20091224/nicholls-coaching-search-nets-42-applicants|work=Houma Today|accessdate=December 14, 2013 |date=December 24, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215023851/http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20091224/ARTICLES/912239867 |archivedate=December 15, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born September 27, 1969) is an [[American football]] coach. He is currently the Offensive Coordinator for the University of Tennessee. He is the former head coach of the [[University of Mississippi]]. Freeze served as the head football coach at [[Lambuth University]] from 2008 to 2009 and at [[Arkansas State University]] in 2011. He was previously a successful high school football coach at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he coached [[Michael Oher]] and [[Greg Hardy]]. He would later follow both of them to the University of Mississippi.

==Early life==
Freeze attended [[Senatobia Municipal School District|Senatobia High School]] and the [[University of Southern Mississippi]], from which he graduated in 1992 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mathematics]] and a minor in coaching and [[sports administration]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.astateredwolves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7200&amp;ATCLID=204944063 Hugh Freeze Bio], Arkansas State University, retrieved December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==

===Briarcrest Christian School===
In 1992, Freeze joined the staff at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], as the football team's [[offensive coordinator]] and [[defensive backs coach]]. Freeze also served as dean of students.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giannotto |first1=Mike|title=At Briarcrest Christian School, Hugh Freeze's legacy is everywhere |url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/2017/07/24/briarcrest-christian-school-hugh-freezes-legacy-everywhere/506677001/ |work=The Commercial Appeal|date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he was promoted to head coach. Freeze ran the no huddle spread offense and led his team to the state championship twice, in 2002 and 2004, and the regional championship each year from 1995 to 1998 and in 2001 and 2002. He received Region 8-AA Coach of the Year honors five times and Associated Press Coach of the Year honors six times.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In ten years at Briarcrest, Freeze was 94–30 as head coach (.785 winning percentage) and 126–37 overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briarcrest.com/page.aspx?pid=821 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213161936/http://briarcrest.com/page.aspx?pid=821 |archivedate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze was depicted in [[The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game|the book]] and motion picture ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'', about one of his former players, current free agent offensive tackle [[Michael Oher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/40483873/ns/sports-college_football/ Oher's HS Coach Gets Top Job at Arkansas State], NBC Sports, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Briarcrest Christian School, Freeze also coached the girls basketball team from 1992 to 2004, and actually had more success in this role, with an overall record of 305–63 (.829 winning percentage), seven straight championship appearances, and four championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/sports/ncaafootball/hugh-freeze-coach-at-ole-miss-follows-an-unlikely-blueprint.html|title=Hugh Freeze, Coach at Ole Miss, Follows an Unlikely Blueprint|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his dismissal from [[Ole Miss]], some former students alleged that Freeze had engaged in inappropriate conduct with female students while at Briarcrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heim|first1=Mark|title=Hugh Freeze stories emerge from former female students at Briarcrest Christian|url=https://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2017/07/hugh_freeze_stories_emerge_fro.html|work=AL.com|date=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peter|first1=Josh|title=Who is Hugh Freeze? Conflicting views of former Ole Miss coach emerge |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/07/29/who-hugh-freeze-conflicting-views-former-ole-miss-coach-emerge/522705001/ |work=USA Today|date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze has denied the allegation and the school has stated it is unaware of any sexual improprieties involving Freeze during his tenure at the school.&lt;ref name=appeal/&gt;

===Ole Miss===
In 2005, the [[University of Mississippi]] hired Freeze as an assistant athletic director for football external affairs. The following season, he became the [[tight ends coach]] and [[recruiting coordinator]], positions he held through 2007.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; After [[2007 Ole Miss Rebels football team|that season]], he replaced head coach [[Ed Orgeron]] on an interim basis before the hiring of [[Houston Nutt]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Freeze interviewed for the offensive coordinator position with Nutt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/13665882.html |title=Nutt Has Long List for New OC |date=January 9, 2008 |work=WTOK.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that eventually went to [[Kent Austin]].

===Lambuth===
In January 2008, [[Lambuth University]], a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), named Freeze its head coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambutheagles.com/article/252.php Hugh Freeze Named Lambuth University Head Football Coach], Lambuth University, January 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he led Lambuth to an 8–4 record and a first round loss in the NAIA playoffs, marking their first appearance in the playoffs since 2004 under then head coach Vic Wallace. He was considered for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's head coaching position following the 2008 season, but remained at Lambuth University for another season and compiled a 20–5 overall record, and defeating opponents 41–17 on average. In 2009, he led the Eagles to their best regular season record in school history with an unblemished 11–0 mark. Lambuth advanced to the second round of the NAIA playoffs for first time in 11&amp;nbsp;years—having won one game before suffering elimination to finish 12–1 as the sixth-ranked team in the NAIA.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

===Arkansas State===
In 2010, he joined the staff at [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] as offensive coordinator after a brief stint as offensive coordinator at [[San Jose State University]] under [[Mike MacIntyre]]. The Red Wolves finished with a 4–8 record, but their offensive rankings jumped from 95th in total offense and 90th in scoring offense in the [[NCAA]] [[Division I FBS]] to 43rd and 46th, respectively. The Red Wolves' offense broke nine school records including total plays (856), first downs (262), pass attempts (438), pass completions (266), completion percentage (.607), passing yards (3,057), passing yards per game (254.8), and passing touchdowns (23). The Red Wolves' offense averaged 403.4 yards per game, eclipsing over 300 yards all 12 times it took the field for the first time in the history of the program. A-State posted at least 400 yards of total offense in seven games during the 2010 campaign, the most ever as an NCAA FBS member, all in his first year as offensive coordinator. After [[2010 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team|the season]], Freeze was promoted to replace head coach [[Steve Roberts (American football)|Steve Roberts]].&lt;ref name=hired&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5875374&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NCFHeadlines Hugh Freeze hired at Arkansas St.], ESPN, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, his only season as head coach at Arkansas State, he led the Red Wolves to a 10–2 record and their first Sun Belt Conference title since 2005. The Red Wolves' offense averaged 447.8 ypg (28th nationally, 1st in Sun Belt Conference) including 293.6 ypg passing and 154.2 ypg rushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109125126/http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |archivedate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze left Arkansas State before the Arkansas State's appearance in the [[GoDaddy.com Bowl]] following the season.

===Ole Miss===
On December 5, 2011, Freeze was announced as the 37th head coach of the University of Mississippi. During the press conference to introduce Freeze as the head coach, he stated that he wanted to "retire at Ole Miss." He was signed to a four-year contract with an annual salary of $1.5 million plus incentives up to $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="FreezeOMHire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hugh Freeze is Rebels' new coach |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7319777/hugh-freeze-mississippi-rebels-emotional-accepting-coaching-job |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 5, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at Ole Miss, Freeze led the Rebels to a 6–6 record in the regular season, making Ole Miss bowl eligible for the first time since 2009 with a 41–24 victory over Mississippi State in the [[Egg Bowl]]. His Rebels accepted a bid to play in the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama, on January 5, 2013. They beat the University of Pittsburgh 38–17 to finish 7–6.

Freeze received national attention on [[National Signing Day]] 2013 as Ole Miss brought in the fifth ranked recruiting class in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings?class=2013 |title=2013 Football Class Rankings |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeze won the 2014 Grant Teaff Coach of the Year award by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org/2014/01/13/hugh-freeze-named-grant-teaff-coach-of-the-year/ |title=Hugh Freeze named coach of the year by Fellowship of Christian Athletes |work=FCA.org |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Freeze's third season at Ole Miss, he led the Rebels to a 7–0 start, the program's best start since the [[Johnny Vaught]] era. By October, they had risen as high as third in the nation, their highest ranking at that late stage in the season in almost half a century. They ultimately finished 9–3, only the third time since Vaught's tenure that Ole Miss has won that many games in the regular season. That netted them an appearance in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]]–their first major bowl appearance since the [[1970 Sugar Bowl]], and easily the biggest bowl they had attended since Vaught's tenure.

On September 19, 2015, Freeze's Rebels beat Alabama, 43–37, in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], making Freeze only the third head coach, along with [[Les Miles]] and [[Steve Spurrier]], to defeat a [[Nick Saban]]-coached team in back-to-back years (Michigan's Lloyd Carr beat Saban's Michigan State Spartans in three consecutive years, '96–'98). The victory catapulted the Rebels to #3 in the AP rankings. They went on to tally their second straight nine-win season, and garnered a berth in the [[2016 Sugar Bowl]], where they won 48–20 over [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]]. They finished ninth in the AP Poll and 10th in the Coaches' Poll—their first top-10 finishes in a final poll since 1969.

In January 2016, the NCAA charged Ole Miss with numerous recruiting violations. An investigation turned up evidence that Ole Miss employees and boosters arranged numerous "impermissible benefits" for players, such as car loans and cash. At least one recruit was suspected of getting help on his college entrance exam.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/2/22/14703296/ole-miss-ncaa-allegations-list-2017|title=The updated list of 21 NCAA allegations against Ole Miss football|author=Morgan Moriarty|publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date= February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The investigation reopened soon after star offensive tackle [[Laremy Tunsil]] admitted taking money from one of Freeze's assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laremy Tunsil says he took money from coach at Ole Miss |work=ESPN |date=April 28, 2016 |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/15424437/2016-nfl-draft-laremy-tunsil-admits-taking-cash-ole-miss-rebels-coach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017—three months after suffering its first losing season since the year Freeze arrived—Ole Miss withdrew from bowl consideration for the upcoming season. The move came on the same day that the NCAA sent an updated notice of allegations charging the Rebels with eight additional violations. Most seriously, it accused Freeze of not monitoring his assistants, and also accused Ole Miss of not properly controlling the program.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations/&gt;

On July 13, 2017, Freeze's predecessor, [[Houston Nutt]], sued Ole Miss for defamation, contending that Freeze and school officials falsely blamed him for the violations. As part of discovery for the lawsuit, Nutt's attorneys filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request for calls Freeze made on his university-issued cell phone during January 2016. Nutt's attorneys contended that Freeze and others at Ole Miss leaked information to the press as part of an effort to smear their client.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/sns-bc-fbc--mississippi-freezes-downfall-20170721-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

While reviewing those records, Nutt's attorneys discovered a call to a number associated with a female [[escort service]], and alerted Ole Miss officials about it.  Freeze claimed it was a misdialed number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2017/07/20/ole-miss-coach-hugh-freeze-called-number-tied-escort-service/498056001/|title=Ole Miss football coach Hugh Freeze made call to number tied to escort service|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; School officials investigated, and discovered what they later described as "a concerning pattern" of similar calls dating back to shortly after he arrived in Oxford. On July 20, chancellor [[Jeff Vitter]] and athletic director [[Ross Bjork]] gave Freeze an ultimatum: resign or be fired for violating the [[morals clause]] of his contract. Freeze opted to resign; offensive coordinator [[Matt Luke (American football)|Matt Luke]] was named interim coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20117453/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-rebels-resigns-escort-service-calls-cited |title=Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze resigns; escort-service calls cited |last=Schlabach |first=Mark |date=July 20, 2017 |work=[[ESPN.com]] |author-link=Mark Schlabach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona Hotshots (AAF)===
On October 11, 2018, Freeze was named as the Offensive Coordinator for the [[Arizona Hotshots]] of the [[Alliance of American Football]].

'''Human response to [[disaster]]s''' has been recorded throughout human history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  In ancient times disasters were often perceived as a result of a deity, divine being, or spiritual creature showing their displeasure over human behavior.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This later changed as humans began to see disasters as natural events that caused physical destruction and social chaos to individuals, communities, and societies as opposed to responses to human actions.

The term "disaster myth" has been created to describe the belief that people will behave in an irrational, uncontrolled, and even extreme manner outside of normal and accepted social standards despite evidence that proponents state prove otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;John Drury, David Novelli, and Clifford Stott, “Psychological disaster myths in the perception and management of mass emergencies: Psychological disaster myths,” ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', 43 (2013): 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Aptekar, ''Environmental Disasters in Global Perspective'' (New York: G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 1994), 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the term further state that people will only act irrationally in the direst of circumstances when terrible danger is imminent and no avenue of escape appears available. They argue that these disaster myths cause a negative impact when they cause people, officials, and disaster-relief organizations to make detrimental or incorrect [[disaster response|disaster planning and response]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panic/Scared ==
One commonly held disaster myth is that people develop an insurmountable, illogical fear in the face of a [[disaster]].  In turn, this fear becomes infectious, spreads to others, and causes people to flee without thinking and in a chaotic manner that could hurt those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, just the opposite can be expected in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when experiencing the increased stress from an [[earthquake]], since they arrive unannounced and it is not known when the aftershocks will end, people continue to act rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only do few people panic, most are unwilling to participate in an organized evacuation.  Those who live in the disaster area tend to stay in place.  The only ones who usually flee are the visitors, tourists, and transients.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Disaster]]s also draw people to the area.  Some want to help while others just want to see the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general public and organizations involved in [[emergency management|emergency planning, management, and response]] all tend to accept this disaster myth as reality.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S191-S192.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Panic]]king can cause harm to others if people flee without thought.  Staying put can be even worse since the people are not getting away from the [[disaster|disaster’s]] damage and destruction.  When necessary, people should evacuate in an orderly manner to avoid the [[disaster]].  It also provides an opportunity to help others evacuate who may need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] can cause officials to be cautious when issuing public bulletins.  By not wanting to instigate or amplify the believed [[panic]], officials may wait too long to provide the information on which the populace should act.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid contributing to or increasing the level of this mythical [[panic]], officials have also chosen to not share information about preparations for some types of [[disaster]]s (e.g. [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare|biological]] attacks).&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of the panic myth was seen with Orson Welles’ [[The War of the Worlds]] radio broadcast in 1938, the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire]], and as [[Hurricane Carla]] approached the Gulf Coast areas of Texas and Louisiana in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rational behavior also dominated after [[earthquake]]s in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite many reports of widespread [[panic]], evidence later proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] affecting the official warnings of authorities has been seen in Mexico when the Rio Grande River flooded, in Italy during the [[flood]]ing of the city of Florence, and after a volcanic eruption in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the instances when authorities chose to send the military instead of humanitarian organizations in response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], it was in some part to help manage and control the perceived [[panic]] among the population.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shock ==
Many people believe those who experience a [[disaster]] firsthand experience emotional trauma that has both immediate and lasting effects.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought the initial devastation of the [[disaster]] leaves people too fragile and in [[Acute stress reaction|shock]].&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they are unable to cope with their situation or participate in recovery efforts.  They are consequently dependent on assistance from outside relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in a small minority of cases does this myth turn out to be true.  And many times, the experienced shock is short-lived.  What in fact happens in most cases is people react immediately to the [[disaster]] and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[disaster]] can also be a jolt of energy which drives people to respond to the emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Claude de Ville de Goyet, “Stop Propagating Disaster Myths,” ''The Lancet'', 356, no. 9231 (August 26, 2000): 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who went through the [[disaster]] are the first engaged in relief and rescue efforts before any outside agency.  They come together along familiar lines such as family and friends and then move as needed to a larger scale involving groups with which they associate (e.g. churches).  If the familiar cannot be contacted or they are unable to respond, only then do most people look toward the faceless law enforcement, welfare, and relief organizations for assistance.  People will also seek help from outside the familiar when special equipment or medical skills are required.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of widespread shock leads outside relief organizations to plan their efforts as if they are the only ones who will be providing assistance.  This may create a disconnected rather than complementary relationship between them and the local agencies.  Additionally, the feeling on the part of the survivors that they do not need to rely on outsiders coupled with the relief organizations believing they are saviors creates a wall between the two which in turn inhibits communication, coordination, and effective relief and recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

People’s reliance on self and the well-known was seen in a variety of disaster types such as the [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado|1953 tornado in Flint-Beecher, Michigan]], the 1955 flood of Marysville and Yuba City, California, [[Hurricane Audrey]] in 1957, [[Hurricane Carla]] in 1961, [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965, and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|1971 earthquake in San Fernando, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both in [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|Mexico City in 1985]] and in [[1999 Izmit earthquake|Turkey in 1999]], thousands of local residents banded together to search for fellow victims in the earthquake wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neighbors performed more than half of the rescue activities after the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] hit Kobe City, Japan in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assistance ==
People believe the population impacted by a [[disaster]] are unable to do anything about their situation so are standing by just waiting for the saviors from afar to swoop in with the solution to all of their suffering.  Not only that, relief organizations often think the aid must be provided immediately.  This myth is especially pervasive when the [[disaster]] strikes a third-world country and it is a “superior” western country coming to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762-763.&lt;/ref&gt;

While relief organizations with emergency managers, medical teams, and the like do offer assistance after a [[disaster]], most people are actually saved by other survivors and local authorities, agencies, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this myth, more supplies are often sent than the disaster area typically needs.  In addition to excess quantity, much of the supplies end up being of little to no use.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relief organizations often do not wait for an assessment of the disaster area and an identification of needs which can be provided by local officials or performed by themselves.  As a consequence, money is often wasted on sending unneeded teams of experts or supplies when local authorities and victims would benefit more if that same money was allocated towards providing resources that filled gaps and complemented their efforts.  Donors compound the issue by donating used clothing, household items, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  With too many supplies on-hand or in possession of supplies they cannot use, local officials are forced to waste manpower and resources on disposing of them.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of providing unwanted and unrequested goods, organizations and donors should send money which can be more easily applied to fulfilling local needs.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this myth’s impact was seen following the [[1993 Hokkaidō earthquake]] as authorities were forced to spend 1.2 million in U.S. dollars on the removal of unnecessary relief supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
Outside rescue, relief, and recovery agencies almost always miscalculate the amount of available resources for basic needs that are available locally in the aftermath of a [[disaster]].  They believe there are not enough materiel, supplies, and personnel for the initial response.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are usually enough supplies to last several weeks.  Enough food can normally be found in stores, warehouses, and people’s homes.  Clothing is rarely needed.  Medical supplies reside in hospitals, warehouses, or nearby communities.  Hospitals as well as police and fire departments often transition to 24-hour operations.  And no evidence is available that proves the unfound belief that key personnel will leave their posts to go attend to their families and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief agencies tend to believe they must act immediately rather than assess the situation first.  As a result, they often provide supplies when there is already enough on-site for the immediate future.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
The prevalence of [[looting]] in the wake of [[disaster]]s is another common myth.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that [[disaster]]s provide cover for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, people take advantage of law enforcement and other agencies responsible for maintaining the peace, safety, and security being occupied with disaster response and relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  People believe criminals will use the [[disaster]] as an opportunity to loot due to a prevalence of evacuated, abandoned, and unguarded homes and stores.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[looting]] can occur, they are always isolated incidents.  And much reported [[looting]] is either entirely false or, at worst, desperate survivors scavenging for necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

But because people believe [[looting]] happens, they frequently refuse to leave despite the disaster’s destruction and damage in order to protect their homes and property.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  When no [[looting]] occurs, people tend to believe it is because enough security was in place to prevent it rather than looters did not exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, officials who believe in this myth end up assigning personnel to a protection role rather than to a much more critical rescue, relief, or logistics support function.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of connection between [[disaster]]s and [[looting]] was seen in the rates for theft and burglaries actually falling after [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  This myth’s impact was also seen outside the United States as evidenced by many Guatemalans staying after the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake]] out of fear of having their animals, homes, and possessions stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morale ==
People tend to believe that survivors are extremely negative after a disaster and need to assurance that the outside world cares and the future is bright for themselves and their community.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, people are most often optimistic and have very high [[morale]] in a disaster’s aftermath.  They frequently subordinate any personal feelings of loss and suffering in order to apply themselves to providing food, shelter, and other services to those in need.  Their motivation to help one another boosts the sense of community and togetherness.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the myth, dignitaries and officials feel the need to come to the disaster area to reassure the survivors.  They often make promises of aid that either are not kept or do not happen in a timely manner.  This can cause survivors to resent outsiders.  This resentment in turn can prevent the survivors from asking for needed skills and resources that the outsiders can in fact provide.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease ==
When a [[disaster]] results in deaths, especially in large quantities, people often believe they are at considerable risk of catching a [[disease]] from them.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also believe [[epidemic|disease epidemics]] develop in the wake of [[disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they died from the [[disaster]] does not make them a risk for spreading [[disease]]s.  If a body does carry a [[infection|communicable disease]], the person already had it when he or she was alive.  The fact that the body is now stationary and will remain in one place makes it less of a risk than prior to death.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  And an [[epidemic]] would happen only if either of two circumstances exist:  1) the [[disaster]] brings [[disease]] with it for which the people are not immune or 2) the disaster’s effects lead to [[malnutrition]], the [[malnutrition]] increases susceptibility to [[disease]], and finally, a large number of people contract the [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in the myth can result in the hurried disposal of the bodies without proper identification, burial, or involvement by the next of kin.  This can add to the suffering of survivors because they were not allowed to properly care for their loved ones.  In addition to the personal toll, needlessly disposing of dead bodies can divert personnel and supplies from other areas where at that time they are needed more (e.g. involved in actions that benefit those still living).&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fear or rumor of an [[epidemic]] can also cause relief organizations to provide medicines, resources, and other aid for a problem that does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This myth has been repeated many times such as in the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua]], [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998, the [[1999 Izmit earthquake|1999 earthquake in Turkey]], and the [[2000 Mozambique flood|2000 flooding in Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, rumors of [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhus]] that were later proven to be false followed the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake in Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetuation of myths ==
[[File:Hydra1.gif|thumb|Myths Live On]]

=== By people ===
People who have experienced a [[disaster]] often believe the dramatic accounts of their own suffering.  It allows them to pass off their actions as atypical and heroic.  In the process of telling others about their involvement, the mythic component of their story is spread along with the reality.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disaster survivors tend to worry about [[looting]].  Their increased anxiety can cause them to spread reports whether they definitely know of any or not.  While most people who are asked admit to not having personally witnessed or experienced [[looting]], many claim of being aware of it elsewhere.  The belief in [[looting]] can make people jump to the conclusion that looting was the cause of items going missing before considering the [[disaster]] may have moved, buried, or destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By organizations ===
Government agencies, civilian organizations, and [[first responder]]s all believe to some extent in disaster myths.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2266.&lt;/ref&gt;  When this happens, the myths in turn are often included in their [[disaster response|planning and response]] to [[disaster]]s, victims, and survivors.  And practices based even partially on disaster myths are not only likely to result in inappropriate or inefficient relief and response actions, they can also help to perpetuate the myths thereby affecting people and property in the next [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 2269.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how organizations can perpetuate disaster myths takes place in the days following a [[disaster]] and up until official numbers are compiled.  During this time, officials from emergency, relief, rescue, and welfare organizations can overestimate the loss of life and destruction of property.  This sheds a more positive light on their organizations since they can point to effective emergency procedures and local heroism as the reason their figures turned out to be higher than the actual numbers.  If their calculations end up being lower than the official figures, they might be blamed for incompetence and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the inability to cope by a disaster-site’s community and people is a myth, it continues to be believed.  One reason is the justification relief agencies give while promoting the assistance they provide.  They feel they are needed because they believe facilities such as hospitals, police and fire departments, and other local first responders do not have the capacity to meet the sheer demand from a disaster.  And if their efforts do not go as planned, they often point to survivors’ irrationality rather than reassess the assumptions on which they developed their relief plans.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local, regional, and national officials make up a primary source of information for the media.  In the self-imposed small window the media has to get out the latest details of the disaster, fact-checking sometimes suffers and they rely solely on the officials' accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, officials substantially influence the media's portrayal and what viewers, listeners, and readers see.  An example of this is seen in officials highlighting the positives within their own organization's efforts while downplaying the information from and activities by unofficial groups and sources.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Goltz, "Are the News Media Responsible for the Disaster Myths? A Content Analysis of Emergency Response Imagery," ''International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters 2'', no. 3 (1984): 365-366.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by the media, law enforcement officials frequently say they are taking sufficient action to prevent [[looting]] even if they have taken no action on the issue.  If the norm happens and little to no [[looting]] occurs, they may be credited for the absence of crime.  But if the exception to the rule happens, they do not want to be blamed for not protecting against the [[looting]].  Whether it is true or not, people believe local law enforcement is out keeping the area secure from looters and the myth continues to propagate.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By media ===
Many myths are perpetuated by the mass media to include newspapers, television, radio, and internet news.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is largely due to the way they portray [[disaster]]s.  In fact, most people base their opinions and beliefs regarding [[disaster]]s and survivor behavior on what they see in the media.  The media strives to keep their viewers’ and readers’ attention for as long as possible.  Drama and destruction is interesting and compelling; most of everything else is secondary.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the most part, the media, regardless of country, takes a fairly standard approach to disaster coverage and reporting.  Immediately after the [[disaster]], they rely on statistics of destruction and damage followed by stories of victims and those providing the rescue and relief.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media repeatedly moves away from discussing the [[disaster]] as a whole to focusing on individual parts and the drama involved in them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of its manner in covering [[disaster]]s, the media may capture only pieces instead of the entire event while emphasizing the unusually heroic or unusually tragic incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A main focus of media coverage centers on [[emergency management]] organizations performing rescue and relief actions in the disaster area.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 364-365.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media frequently portrays international relief teams as angels saving the victims from the disaster's destruction while simultaneously implying the local officials are negligent, inept, or corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this backdrop, the portrayal of a breakdown in society and social behavior is more likely to appear in coverage of [[disaster]]s occurring outside the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this type of portrayal that helps perpetuate disaster myths involves the frequent reports of people panicking in both small and large numbers to the point of fleeing when faced by an oncoming [[disaster]] such as a [[hurricane]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, when the international media noticed few stories of [[looting]] coming out of [[Japan]] following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan Disaster in 2011]], they generally remarked on how well the Japanese people behave.  By believing in this myth, they assumed the Japanese showed more behavioral control than other societies rather than understanding it rarely happens in association with any [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hunchun incident''' (October 2, 1920) was a reported raid on a [[Japan]]ese consulate in Manchuria resulting in the death of thirteen Japanese.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Japanese government used this incident to justify sending thousands of Imperial Japanese troops into [[Manchuria]] on October 5, 1920. These escalations culminated with the [[Battle of Qingshanli]] (October 21–26, 1920) between [[Japan]] and the Korean Independence Army,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  where [[Koreans|Korean]] rebels fought Japanese soldiers.

==Background==

For more than a decade prior to Korea’s [[March 1st Movement]] (1919) nationalist groups of Korean rebels, many of whom were former soldiers in the Korean army, organized into various pro-independence factions in Manchuria.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Due to its strategic location across the Korean border, guerilla fighters could effectively launch raids on Japanese consular police stations, and then retreat back to the Chinese side of the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Hong Pomdo (a previous [[Righteous Army]] leader) created the Korean Independence Army and trained so-called independence fighters in [[Yanji]]. Additionally, the Northern Route Military Headquarters was established under the leadership of So Il, with Kim Chwajin commanding more than four hundred independence fighters at its officer training school. Separately, Yi Tonghwi also trained over 3,000 independence fighters in Hunchun and armed them with weapons provided by the Red [[Bolshevik]] army.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the March 1st Movement’s failure to secure independence and arouse international sentiments toward the Koreans’ plight under Japanese colonial rule, disaffected Koreans came together on April 13, 1919 in Shanghai to form a republican Korean provisional government with the hope of working together with the independence factions in Manchuria to eventually obtain freedom from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Robinson, 2007, Korea’s Twentieth-Century Odyssey: A Short History (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the momentum behind Korean independence movements in Manchuria increased, Japanese consular police chief Suematsu Kichiji became increasingly concerned about increasing radical Bolshevism among Koreans. To try and suppress these movements, he ordered numerous illegal police raids on suspected radical Jiandao base camps, which were protested by local Chinese leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is clear that some of the Korean guerrilla fighters in Manchuria were influenced by leftist ideologies, the major factions primarily supported the [[Shanghai Provisional Government]] and were focused primarily on Korean independence and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angered by the Japanese suppression of the March 1st Movement, Korean independence fighters in Manchuria began increasing their raids against Japanese border posts, killing numerous Japanese guards, with the eventual goal of advancing into Korea to remove the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early summer months of 1920, Korean rebels fought with Japanese troops in thirty-two battles along the border. After one particular Japanese counterattack, Hong Pomdo’s forces surrounded and killed 120 Japanese soldiers and wounded more than 200.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack and Controversy==

In effort to contain the Korean rebels, Japan petitioned both [[Tokyo]] and the Chinese government to help, but received little assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequently, on October 2, 1920, a Japanese consulate in the Chinese city of [[Hunchun]] in [[Jilin]] Province was attacked and burned to the ground purportedly (according to Japanese sources) by the Korean Independence Army, killing thirteen Japanese people.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Text of Bryce EUlogies and Statement on Siberia |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/24/98975084.pdf |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=January 24, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was further reported that the “bandits” carrying out this attack “committed indiscriminate acts of murder and pillage” and “looted local shops.”&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many South Korean historians maintain, however, that the attack on Hunchun was not carried out by the Korean rebels, but rather was staged by the Japanese to justify incursion into Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some South Korean sources further believe that the attack was coordinated with Chinese bandit leader Ch'ang-chiang-hao who had been bribed by the Japanese to carry out the attack with several bandits in order to incriminate the Koreans. These sources maintain that Chang went further than the Japanese had requested him to in the scale of his attack.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Other South Korean scholars even maintain that the entire incident was a complete Japanese fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Korea]] is likewise skeptical about the Japanese narrative of the incident, with official sources recently asserting that “the Japanese imperialists cooked up the ‘Hunchun incident’ in which they hurled mounted bandits into attacking their consulate and kicked up a wholesale whirlwind of suppression against Koreans in Northeast China under that pretext.”&lt;ref&gt;"North Korea Criticizes Japan's ‘Punitive Operations’ in 1920." BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific, Oct 02, 2009, http://search.proquest.com/docview/460755521&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult for historians to determine who was behind the attack, or whether the incident actually took place, this controversial event is historically significant because Japan used it to justify its escalated military intervention in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan petitioned and received permission from China to send 15,000 troops from the 19th Division of the [[Chosen Army]] of Japan to contain the Korean rebel armies in Jilin province.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Aftermath==

In reaction to the Hunchun incident, a Japanese punitive “Jiandao Expedition” was accordingly sent to Manchuria, and used “search and destroy” patrols to suppress the guerrilla fighters by carrying out numerous arrests and executions.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 1920, a Korean Commission report described that Japanese soldiers had burned down thirty-two villages and killed “all the male inhabitants of the [Hunchun] district, and massacred 145 peaceful inhabitants.” One house was reportedly burned down with “women and children inside.”&lt;ref&gt;“Koreans Charge Cruelty,” New York Times, December 24, 1920, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/12/24/103519339.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Korean independence forces in Manchuria were never effectively organized under the leadership of the Shanghai Provisional Government, they did achieve notable military victories against the Japanese brigades.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most significant of these was the [[Battle of Qingshanli]], where about 400 Korean rebels were able to defeat the better-trained Japanese after four days of intense combat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history/independence_army.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In this battle the Koreans killed about 1,200 Japanese soldiers while losing only 60 of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to Japanese records, 11 soldiers were [[killed in action]], 24 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;陸軍第十九師團司令部　「間島事件鮮支人死傷者調」　大正十年二月二十五日&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1921, after a series of skirmishes and retreats on both sides, as well as criticism from local Chinese authorities and the international community, most members of the 19th Division withdrew from eastern Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the socialist-leaning Korean rebels were then recruited by the Red Bolshevik army to assist in its civil war prior to the formation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

On 10 October  2012, at  the [[Mexico–United States border]] near [[Nogales, Arizona]], [[U.S. Border Patrol]] agent Lonnie Swartz fired 16 shots&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23" /&gt; at '''José Antonio Elena Rodríguez''', killing him,&lt;ref name=shots&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/magazine/10-shots-across-the-border.html|title=10 Shots Across the Border|last=Binelli|first=Mark|date=2016-03-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that [[Criminal rock throwing|young men threw rocks]] at him and other law enforcement agents.

After the incident, the law enforcement  agencies stated the Mexican civilians were trying to stop them from confiscating a shipment of contraband drugs  as well as moving immigrants across the border.

Rodriguez was hit 10 times by the patrol officer's shots.&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carranza|first1=Rafael|last2=O'Dell|first2=Rob|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=31 May 2015|title=Justice for José?

==Incident==
Around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday 10 October, 2012, John Zuñiga, a police officer in [[Nogales, Arizona]],  received a call reporting "suspicious activity" on International Street, a road running directly along the  border. Getting to the scene, Zuñiga heard from another police officer from Nogales, Quinardo Garci, that  two men carrying "bundles taped to their backs" had climbed the fence into the United States. Identifying the bundles, on the basis of similar incidents in the past, as most probably containing [[marijuana]], they called out for back up.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;

After several [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs]] agents arrived, they saw the two men scaling the fence back into Mexico, empty-handed and with nothing on their backs. They commanded the two men to climb back down. At that time, Garcia and Zuñiga stated in their reports that they saw "rocks flying through the air"&lt;ref name="tucson.com"&gt;{{Cite website|title=Border agent's murder trial postponed|url=http://tucson.com/news/border-agent-s-murder-trial-postponed/article_561ac027-ef47-5d29-8d01-9c073669afff.html|format=|date=2016-01-05|author=Perla Trevizo|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|postscript=|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the assorted agents and also heard "gunfire," although they were unable to identify its source.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"/&gt; 

In the days following the incident, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] agency stated that
:After verbal commands from agents to cease [assaulting the agents with rocks] were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm. One of the subjects appeared to have been hit.

The person hit was José Antonio Elena Rodríguez, a 16-year old resident of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales, Mexico]]. He was unarmed, standing on the Mexican side of the border on a sidewalk on Calle Internacional street, in front of a doctor’s office, below a sign reading "Medical Emergencies" in Spanish. He was hit from behind by 10 bullets.&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"/&gt; The [[autopsy]] revealed that gunshot wounds to the head, [[lung]]s, and [[artery|arteries]] killed him.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR1"/&gt; 

==Trial==
U.S. Border Patrol agent Lonnie Ray Swartz was charged with [[second degree murder]] for the killing of José Rodríguez. It was the first time a US law enforcement officer was brought up on charges related to a killing that took part across the US-Mexican border, despite there having been a number of similar incidents in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=NPR1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis|first=Charles|date=4 January 2015|title=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Has Killed Nearly 50 People in 10 Years.

In the trial, which began in late 2015 at the Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Courthouse, the defendant claimed he had used deadly force because Rodriguez "had been throwing rocks."&lt;ref name=shots/&gt; Although a witness testified that Rodríguez was not throwing rocks at the law enforcement officers, evidence showed that he was, along with other youths and men. Prosecutors acknowledged that Rodríguez was throwing rocks across the border but stated "he did not deserve to die" for this.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mistrial announced for U.S. border agent linked to teenager's fatal shooting|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mistrial-us-border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-manslaughter-charges-today-2018-04-23/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Customs and Border Protection refused to release surveillance-camera footage of the incident.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

After the testimony by Emma Lew, the director of the medical examiner in [[Miami-Dade County]], Florida, who stated that Swartz's first shot "likely hit the boy in the middle of his back as he was running," the prosecution rested its case in the trial on 5 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040518_swartz_trial/swartz-trial-defense-struggles-with-first-witness-after-prosecution-rests/|title=

On 23 April 2018, Swartz was acquitted of the charge for second-degree murder; the jury was [[deadlock]]ed on lesser charges.&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael  |last2=O'Dell |first2=Rob |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=24 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
==Aftermath==
The judge presiding on the trial, [[Raner Collins]], declared a [[mistrial]]. The head of the Tucson union for Border Patrol officers, stated, after the jury's decision was announced, that "justice was properly served" and that the union was "pretty happy with it."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt; 

After the jury's decision was reported in the news, protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tucson late Monday afternoon, and blocked off the intersection in front of it. Among those participating in the protest was the mother of Carlos LaMadrid, another Mexican teen who, in 2011, had been shot and killed by Border Patrol agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/05/11/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-retried-death-jose-antonio-elena-rodriguez/602687002/|title=Border Patrol agent will be retried in fatal cross-border shooting of teen|date=11 May 2018|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=20 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar incidents==
A 2015 review by the Border Patrol's [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] department reviewed 67 shooting incidents that resulted in 19 people dying, during the period from January 2010 through October 2012. The review found agents guilty of criminal conduct in 3 of the incidents. Two agents faced disciplinary action in the form of an "oral reprimand."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

'''Let's Do It! World''' is a global civic movement that started from [[Estonia]], asking people worldwide to join a series of local, national and regional clean-up events.  Among other projects, it is the founder of '''[[World Cleanup Day]]'''.

The Let's Do It! movement was first conceived in Estonia in year 2008, where a country clean-up action called '''[[Let's Do It 2008|Let's do it!]]''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: "Teeme Ära!") cleaned up 10,000 tons of illegal waste by more than 50,000 volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead many countries also started their own country clean-up events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/domestic-news/general/15176-finland-gets-spring-cleaning.html |title=Finland gets spring cleaning |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715071118/http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Ukrainian Participants Clean Up Their Village |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new initiative called Let's do it!

==The origins of the massive cleanup movement==
On the 3rd of May 2008 over 50,000 people came out of their homes to clean up Estonia, the rest followed the process via all the media channels. That's 4% out of a population of 1,3 million - which would equal 15,3 million in the USA or 57 million in India. The idea spread from Estonia to the whole Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |title=Anti-garbage campaigners plan mass Internet-led clean up |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129054219/http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than 250,000 people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCNrezFwQUYGj2rJNJJ75ENwcDgQ |title=AFP: Massive clean-up drive in Latvia, Lithuania |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2010 Portugal cleaned their country with 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/20/massive-countryside-clean-up-in-portugal/ |title=Massive countryside clean-up in Portugal |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!|Slovenia followed shortly]], breaking all records with 270,000 people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2010/05/03/wv.clean.up.slovenia.cnn |title=CNN: Big clean up in Slovenia |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people have participated in Let’s Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries – Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/statistics |title=Let's Do It!

In 2012, starting from 24 March until 25 September, a series of cleanups happened around the globe, on all continents, bringing together millions of volunteers in 96 countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The action was initiated on 24 March 2012 by [[Let's Clean Slovenia|volunteers in Slovenia]] and [[Portugal]].

To bring together doers and initiators and share existing experience – Let's Do It! teams were organizing workshops and regional gatherings, introducing the World Cleanup 2012 around the world.

==World Cleanup actions until 2018==
After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071639/http://www.letsdoitworld.org/news/civic-leaders-40-countries-gather-kosovo-erase-massive-waste-problem Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina], Kosovo on the 6th-9th of February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole World from illegally dumped solid waste and to then keep the planet clean. To reach the essential transformation in the global society, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world’s population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change.

==Biggest cleanup actions==
[[File:Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015.jpg|thumb|Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015]]
The most massive cleanup actions (data: October 2014) within the movement have happened in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo and in Albania.

In 2012, 289,000 '''Slovenians''' came out of the homes and cleaned up the entire country in just one day. This is 14% of the country's population.

In 2013, 375,000 cleaned up the country in '''Bulgaria''' in a one-day country cleanup action (13,9% of country's population).

In 2012, 210,000 people (10% of country's population) cleaned up '''Latvia''' from illegal waste in just one day.

[[Aircraft hijacking]] incidents between the United States and [[Cuba]] were at their height between 1968 and 1972. These incidents have variously been attributed to [[terrorism]], extortion, flight for political asylum, mental illness, and transportation between the two countries as a result of the ongoing antagonistic [[Cuba-United States relations]] and the Communist government restrictions against Cubans attempting to leave Cuba.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf Testing a rational choice model of airline hijackings] Study of data  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822080601/http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent measures by both governments contributed to a gradual reduction of reported incidents towards the mid-1970s. Governmental measures included an amendment to [[Cuban law]] which made hijacking a crime in 1970, the introduction of metal detectors in U.S. airports in 1973, and a joint agreement between the U.S. and Cuba signed in Sweden to return or prosecute hijackers.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Below is a non-comprehensive list of hijacking incidents of aircraft between Cuba and the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

'''Games with concealed rules''' are [[game]]s where the [[Game#Rules|rules]] are intentionally concealed from new players, either because their discovery is part of the game itself, or because the game is a hoax and the rules do not exist. In fiction, the counterpart of the first category are games that supposedly do have a rule set, but that rule set is not disclosed.

==Actual games==

===Discovery games===
* [[Eleusis (card game)|Eleusis]]: A card game in which one player secretly decides on a rule which determines which cards may be played on top of each other. The other players then use deductive logic to work out the secret rule.
* [[Haggle (game)|Haggle]]: A party game in which the [[Gamemaster]] divides a set of cards and a subset of the full rules among players and allows them to trade for other cards and rules. 
* [[Mao (card game)|Mao]]: A [[Shedding-type game|shedding-type]] card game where the winner of a round adds a concealed rule of their choice to all subsequent rounds.
* [[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]: A [[tabletop role-playing game]] in which the rules are considered "classified". Only the [[Gamemaster]] has full knowledge of the rules, while other players must deduce them by trial and error as they proceed through the game. (The game acknowledges that players may read the gamemaster section, but ''demonstrating'' knowledge of the rules is considered treasonous, and the gamemaster may also make arbitrary changes.)
*[[Penultima]]: A chess variant in which the spectators make secret rules governing how the pieces move and capture. The two players are unaware of the rules and must discover them by inductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fryers |first1=Michael |year=1998 |title=Penultima |journal=[[Variant Chess]] |volume=3 |issue=28 |pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scissors (game)|Scissors]]: A party game in which a pair of scissors is passed between players, with the passer declaring that they are being passed "open" or "closed" based on an individual and secret rule. The other players must use observation to deduce the rule each player uses to make the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/326383402.html?dids=326383402:326383402&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+15%2C+1899&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=TWO+JOLLY+GAMES%2C |title= Two Jolly Games, A Noisy Play Imported From Peru and 'The Spider And The Fly' |date= October 15, 1899 |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hofmann |first= Mary Christina |title= Games for Everybody |publisher= Dodge Publishing |location= New York |year= 1905 |url= https://archive.org/stream/games10/games10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whose Triangle Is It?: A party game in which one player points to three people or objects, forming an imaginary triangle, and then asks "Whose triangle is it?" The triangle belongs to the person closest to the closest object of a similar color to the color of second point of the triangle, but this rule is not told to new players, and the game is for new players to figure out what the rule is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yarps.org/resources/games/mind-games/ |title= Mind Games |work= Yarps}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Outbound Training |url= http://www.slideshare.net/outboundtraining/team-building-games-outbound-training |title= Team Building Games &amp; Activities |publisher= Slide Share}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]]: A game in which one player creates a rule for structures to follow and the other players try to discover the rule by building structures
* [[Snaps (game)]]: A game in which a player spells out a name using finger snapping and verbal cues.  Featured in [[P.S. I Love You (film)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Snaps|title=How to Play Snaps.|publisher=WikiHow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax or joke games===
* [[52 Pickup]]: A card game in which dealer scatters the cards on the floor and non-dealer must pick them up.
* [[Mornington Crescent (game)|Mornington Crescent]]: Originally a round in the [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/article/|publisher= BBC |title= I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue: A History |accessdate= July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game consists of each panelist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system. The apparent aim is to be the first to announce "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern Line. Despite appearances, however, there are no rules to the game, and both the naming of stations and the specification of "rules" are based on stream-of-consciousness association and improvisation. Thus the game is intentionally incomprehensible.

==Games in works of fiction==

===Games with undisclosed rules===
* [[43-Man Squamish]]: ''MAD Magazine'' published an article outlining a college sport designed to be unplayable. The sport features a pentagonal field, silly-sounding terms and a dummy on each team.
* [[Calvinball]]: In the comic series ''[[Calvin &amp; Hobbes]]'', ''Calvinball'' is a game regularly played by the main characters. The only consistent rule of ''Calvinball'' is that "Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice".
* [[Double Fanucci]]: Featured in the computer game [[Zork Zero]], ''Double Fanucci'' has mind-bogglingly complex "rules". Legal play can depend on things like the phase of the Moon and the ancestry of the players.
* [[Dragon Poker]]: A fictional card game by [[Robert Asprin]] in the [[MythAdventures]] series. The rules change depending on weather, seating position, time of day, and other undisclosed modifiers. However, a playable version has been created by fans, based on the rules and play that are presented in the books.

===Hoax games===
* [[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|Numberwang]]: A recurring "game show" on the sketch series ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|That Mitchell and Webb Look]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC - Numberwang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/numberwang.shtml |title=BBC - Comedy - That Mitchell And Webb Site - Numberwang |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to ''Mornington Crescent'' above, the "contestants" call out random numbers in an attempt to score a "Numberwang", though the responses are scripted and there are no actual rules to winning a "Numberwang".
* Clique: The online satirical gaming magazine ''Critical Miss'' featured rules for a card game called Clique, a parody of collectible card games that used printed cards and spurious spoken rules to confuse onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue9/clique1.html|title=Clique: The Uncollectable, Unplayable Card Game|accessdate=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of games in Star Trek#Fizzbin|Fizzbin]]: In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "A Piece of the Action", [[James T. Kirk]] created this game while he and [[Spock (Star Trek)|Cmdr. Spock]] were being held prisoner. They "taught" the game to the guards, improvising the rules until their captors were sufficiently distracted, then overpowered them and escaped.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51760">This is a chronological list of conflicts in which [[peasant]]s played a significant role.

==Background==
History of peasant wars spans over a period of over two thousand years. A variety of reasons fueled the emergence of the peasant revolt phenomenon, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03066157508437962|title=The Late  Medieval Peasant Wars|author=Frantisek Graus|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=22 October 2014|doi=10.1080/03066157508437962|volume=3|journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tax resistance]] 
*[[Social inequality]] 
*[[Religious war]] 
*[[Wars of national liberation|National liberation]] 
*Resistance against [[serfdom]] 
*Redistribution of land
*External factors such as [[Black Death|plague]] and [[Great Famine of 1315-1317|famine]]

Later peasant revolts such as the [[Telangana Rebellion]] were also influenced by [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Maoism|ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/804/001/Skocpol%201979%20What%20Makes%20Peasant%20Revolutionary.pdf|title=Review: What Makes Peasants Revolutionary?|author=Theda Skocpol|date=April 1982|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peasant rebellions ended prematurely and were unsuccessful. Peasants suffered from limited funding and lacked the training and organisational capabilities of professional armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/bondeoproer/?tx_historyview_pi1[lang]=1&amp;cHash=f8911ce32f21435e54b5720e3e9db0f7|title=Peasant Rebellions|work=Danmarkshistorien-Aarhus University|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous historical escapes==
[[File:Famous adventures and prison escapes of the civil war (1893) (14573020789).jpg|{{largethumb}}|On November 27, 1863, [[John Hunt Morgan]] and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron.]]

There have been many infamous escapes throughout history:

===13th century===
* In 1244, whilst imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr]] crafted a make-shift rope made of bed sheets and cloths, lowered it, and climbed down. However, because he was heavy, the rope broke and as a consequence, he fell to his death.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8QY7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT135&amp;dq=gruffydd+ap+llywelyn+fawr+death+rope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2i-Gvif7XAhVE-qQKHbfaD2sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=gruffydd%20ap%20llywelyn%20fawr%20death%20rope&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
* In 1621 Dutch author [[Hugo Grotius]] escaped from [[Loevestein|Loevestein Castle]] where he was held captive by hiding himself inside a book chest. He was then smuggled outside.

===18th century===

* Englishman [[Jack Sheppard]] took to theft and burglary in 1723, and was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times, making him a notorious public figure and wildly popular with the poorer classes.
* The Italian author and adventurer [[Giacomo Casanova]] escaped from prison in 1757.

===19th century===
*In the [[Libby Prison Escape]], during the [[American Civil War]], over 109 [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[POWs]] broke out of a building at [[Libby Prison]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] on the night between February 9 and February 10, 1864. All but 50 (two were drowned in the nearby [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]) successfully reached back to Union lines.
*The notorious outlaw [[Billy The Kid]] managed to escape from prison in 1881, but was captured and shot by [[Pat Garrett]] only a few months later.

===1900–1950===
* In 1901, [[Lum You]] was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by a [[Pacific County, Washington]] court.  He enjoyed great public sympathy, including from county officials, who supposedly allowed him to escape by leaving his cell door unlocked at night.

On 21 September 2008 at 10 pm local time, in the [[Ghulam Khan]] district of [[North Waziristan]] Pakistani soldiers fired on two American helicopter gunships that entered Pakistani airspace with 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm [[heavy machine gun]]s. The helicopters stopped and hovered for a while, before returning over the border to Afghanistan without retaliation. It is unknown if any of the helicopters sustained any damage in this first incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jqhY55584EVVKxIIbOeHrLWeoPvA Pakistani troops twice repel US choppers: officials] AFP, 23 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7628890.stm Pakistan troops 'repel US raid'] -''BBC News'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty minutes later, two gunships attempted to cross the border again at the same place. Pakistani regular and [[Frontier Corps]] troops fired warning shots into the air and away from the helicopters, causing the helicopters to turn back without attacking any targets in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Pak-troops-fire-at-US-helicopters-in-N-Waziristan/364409/ Pak troops fire at US helicopters in N Waziristan] – ''ExpressIndia.com'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show ''[[NOVA ScienceNow]]'' on [[PBS]]. Since 2009, Tyson hosted the weekly podcast ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]''. A spin-off, also called ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', a successor to [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1980 series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fox |title=Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.cosmosontv.com/ |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] awarded Tyson the [[Public Welfare Medal]] in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html Neil deGrasse Tyson to Receive Public Welfare Medal – Academy's Most Prestigious Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210506/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}" (February 26, 2015).

He credited Dr. Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his "first intellectual role model" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer &amp; Shepherd-Wynn 2012, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 15, 2013 |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Prodigy Astronomer |url=http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216182841/http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |deadurl=yes |publisher=Parlemagazine.com |accessdate=May 27, 2013 |archivedate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who was a faculty member at [[Cornell University]], tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] studies.&lt;ref name=Whitaker2000 /&gt; In his book, ''The Sky Is Not the Limit'', Tyson wrote:

{{quote|My letter of application had been dripping with an interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me, had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention.

Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of ''person'' I wanted to become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Standing Up in the Milky Way]] |series=[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]] |date=March 9, 2014 |network=[[National Geographic Channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[Fox Life]], et al. |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 3, 2014 |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html?_r=0 |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson chose to attend [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he majored in physics and lived in [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]]. He was a member of the [[Sport rowing|crew]] team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, [[Letterman (sports)|lettering]] in his senior year.

[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Tyson to serve on the [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry]] and in 2004 to serve on the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |title=American Museum of Natural History |author=(c) Copyright 2003, American Museum of Natural History |website=amnh.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022134532/http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tyson &amp; Kepler team.jpg|thumb|left|Tyson in December 2011 at a conference marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'']]
In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part ''Origins'' miniseries of the PBS ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/ |title=NOVA – Origins |year=2004 |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |author=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |first2=Donald |last2=Goldsmith |year=2004 |publisher=W.W.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [[Planetary Society]]. He was also the host of the PBS program ''[[Nova ScienceNow]]'' until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow |title=NOVA – scienceNOW |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]] symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s popular series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson in Sydney.JPG|thumb|Tyson promoting the ''Cosmos'' TV series in Australia for National Geographic, 2014]]
In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show ''StarTalk''. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [[Nerdist YouTube Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOir4aMu0vYI Nerdist Channel Sneak Peek] (March 27, 2012) from YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [[White House Student Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/students-are-stars-white-house-film-festival-n40846 |title=Students Are Stars at White House Film Festival |publisher=NBC News |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he helped revive Carl Sagan's ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' television series, presenting ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins at Howard University (2) - September 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|Tyson in conversation with [[Richard Dawkins]] at Howard University, 2010]]

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity.

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
[[File:Bill Nye, Barack Obama and Neil deGrasse Tyson selfie 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyson, [[Bill Nye]] and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] take a [[selfie]] at the [[White House]], 2014]]
Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="tysontranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=4 Dec 2012 |date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tysontranscript_video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony-video |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony (Video) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [[Penny4NASA]], a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,&lt;ref name="space-advocates-2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Space Advocates |url=http://www.spaceadvocates.com/about |publisher=Space Advocates |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.&lt;ref name="penny4nasa-whywefight"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Fight |url=http://www.penny4nasa.org/why-we-fight |publisher=Penny4NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Space Chronicles|Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier]]'' Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting [[Exploration of Mars|humans to Mars]], will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the [[United States Federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/neil-degrasse-tyson-how-space-exploration-can-make-america-great-again/253989/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: How Space Exploration Can Make America Great Again |first=Chris |last=Heller |website=theatlantic.com |publisher=The Atlantic |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal rights ===
Tyson collaborated with the organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) on a [[public service announcement]] that stated, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that kindness is a virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Interview With PETA |url=http://www.peta.org/features/Dr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also granted PETA an interview in which he discussed the concept of intelligence (both of human and other animals), the failure of humans to heretofore communicate meaningfully with other animals, and the need of humans to be [[Empathy|empathetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Exclusive PETA Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL6hj6xLE8w&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta.org%2Ffeatures%2FDr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx&amp;feature=player_embedded |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/05/peta-neil-degrasse-tyson-peta_n_912491.html |title=Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson Featured In PETA Ad |journal=Huffington Post |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/worlds-sexiest-astrophysicist-neil-degrasse-tyson-in-peta-ad-video.html |title="World's Sexiest" Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson In PETA Ad (Video)) |publisher=Treehugger |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |author=Kessler, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22475">The number of '''personal watercraft-related accidents''' has increased with the popularity of [[personal watercraft]] (PWC) (also commonly known as jet skis) since their introduction during the late 1960s. The use of the term "jet ski" for all types of PWCs is a [[misnomer]]; [[Jet Ski]] is a [[Trademark|registered trademark]] in the United States for a line of PWCs manufactured by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0913875791 | title = Boat Accident Reconstruction and Litigation | last1 = Rickman | first1 = Roy Scott |author2=Michael M. Sampsel, Jeanne-Marie D. van Hemmen | year = 1996 | publisher = Lawyers and Judges Publishing | page = 68  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased use of personal watercraft since their inception, the hazards accompanying their use have also increased. According to U.S. government reports, most accidents are associated with rental operators, underage operators, under-trained and undereducated boaters and a variety of factors associated with recreational-boating accidents (excessive speed, inattention, reckless operation, alcohol consumption and violations of the "Rules of the Road").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caufield|first=T.G.|title=A Beginner's Guide to the Rules of the Road|year=2001|publisher=Great Lakes Marine Transportation LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;Almost all bodies of water in the United States are governed by the Inland Navigation Rules or their state law equivalents. These "rules" are typically referred to as the "rules of the road."&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their affordability, ease of use, and relatively low transportation and maintenance costs, personal watercraft have significantly increased the number of water-based enthusiasts in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This rise in participation has created conflicts between the various boating segments in the U.S. and a need for additional boater education. Recreational-boating accidents are the second-largest transportation-related cause of injury in the U.S. (after automobile accidents).&lt;ref name=accidents&gt;NTSB Boating Safety Report (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal watercraft are vessels designed for recreational use on the water, carrying between one and four passengers. The [[U.S. Coast Guard]] defines PWC as "craft less than 13 feet in length designed to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing or kneeling on the craft rather than within the confines of a hull".&lt;ref name=osix&gt;"Boating Statistics 2006." {{cite web |url=http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/Boating_Statistics_2006.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902191629/http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/boating_statistics_2006.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-02 |df= }} Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The original PWCs were manufactured during the mid-1950s in the United Kingdom and Europe. Ten years later Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP) began manufacturing PWC's in the USA under the name [[Sea-Doo (disambiguation)|Sea-Doo]]. BRP left the PWC business shortly thereafter, and in 1973 Kawasaki introduced a "stand-up" watercraft designed for a single operator (with a tray for standing or kneeling, in place of a seat). By the late 1980s "sit-down" models had appeared on the market, allowing the rider to be seated (similar to a [[snowmobile]] or motorcycle seat). These sit-down models were made by Kawasaki (1986), [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] (1987) and BRP (1988). Polaris and Arctic were two American companies which entered the market during the early 1990s.

PWC have an [[Inboard motor|inboard engine]] with a screw-shaped [[impeller]] to create [[thrust]] and [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] for steering. They are small, fast, and easy to maneuver; PWCs do not use external [[Propeller (marine)|propellers]], making them safer for swimmers and wildlife. The [[Usability|user-friendly]] properties of PWCs have contributed to the increase in popularity amongst less-experienced watercraft users. To increase safety, a number of U.S. [[Consumer organization|consumer groups]] suggested that all boats should utilize the jet-drive mechanism (also called a [[pump-jet]]) employed by PWC manufacturers since this would reduce the risk of propeller injuries.&lt;ref name=prop&gt;The Coast Guard's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for houseboats provided that houseboats should either have a propeller guard installed or be converted to jet drive power.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents ==
All boating accidents in the United States either occur on state- or federally-patrolled waters.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Whether state or federal, reports must be filed for a predefined level of damage and are compiled by the [[United States Coast Guard]] (which uses the reported data for its annual BAR—Boating Accident Report—Statistical Reports). As automotive [[Law enforcement officer#United States|law-enforcement officers]] outnumber [[Water police#List of water police units|boating law-enforcement officers]] in the U.S., federal government reports for watercraft are comparatively fewer.&lt;ref name=rept&gt;As a general rule of thumb the Coast Guard believes that it receives about 10% of the "property damage only" accidents, but 90% of the serious personal injury accidents.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Transportation Safety Board|National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)]] conducted general investigation of the recreational-boating accident-reporting system in 1998 and compiled its findings in a published report.&lt;ref name=invt&gt;National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998. http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/8000/8400/8418/SS9801.pdf Retrieved on December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The NTSB's investigation emerged with data seen as representative of overall recreational boating; an example follows from the report's conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Inattention (attributed to 307 operators), inexperience (attributed to 296 operators), and inappropriate speed for the operating conditions (attributed to 246 operators) were the most frequently cited causes that contributed to the PWC accidents. One or more of these three causes were associated with 70 percent of the 814 accidents. A fourth cause, improper lookout (153), was associated with about one-fifth of the accidents.&lt;ref name=causes&gt;Page 18-19 of NTSB Report (1998). This results in 90% of all accidents being attributed to improper lookout, inexperience, inappropriate speed and inattention. The remaining 10% of the accidents were mostly due to rules of the road infractions, weather or environmental conditions and other "unknown" causes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the aforementioned interpretation of the NTSB report: 
* The vast majority of accidents (over 90 percent) were caused by operator error.
* There is a significantly higher association with accidents for rental operators (nearly 25 percent) than is the case for the general boating population; however, this may be related to the higher percentage of rental operators.&lt;ref name=edu&gt;"The Safety Board is concerned about persons who rent PWC. Nearly one-quarter of the PWC operators involved in the 1997 accidents analyzed by the Safety Board for this study (292 of 1,218, or 24 percent) were operating rented PWC" NTSB Report (page 33)&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The NTSB report did not conclude that PWCs are disproportionately represented in boating-accident statistics.&lt;ref name=accd&gt;"The study was not designed to estimate how often PWC accidents occur, nor are the results of the study necessarily representative of all PWC accidents". Page i.
"However, in 1994 the number of PWC fatalities began to increase noticeably because the number of PWCs in operation increased". Page v.
"The increase in PWC fatalities is proportional to the increase of PWC in operation." Page 2.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A study performed by the Red Cross in 1991 concluded that during the research period, PWC accidents were not disproportionate to their use by the boating population. This was later supported by a Coast Guard study presented to the State of Vermont in 1996. Both studies presented findings that the comparative accident rates for personal water craft were not [[wikt:disproportionate|disproportionate]] to their use by the boating population; the reports emphasized the high level of attention and publicity that PWC accidents receive.&lt;ref name=rates&gt;There is a difference between comparing the number accidents to the number of registrations, as opposed to comparing the number of accidents to the actual hours of use of the boats. Large yachts, which spend most of their time sitting at the marina, are less at risk of an accident due to the low hours of use.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s, several states (including [[California]] and [[Florida]], two [[wikt:jurisdiction|jurisdictions]] which, according to the NTSB report, accounted for over 50 percent of all personal-water-craft accidents in the U.S.) changed their laws regarding the use of personal water craft. These amendments included the introduction of limits for [[wake]]-jumping, the prescribed use of a PWC within {{convert|100|ft|m}} of another vessel, "spraying" activities,{{clarify|date=May 2012}} mandated operation of PWCs within {{convert|150|ft|m}} of the shoreline, and age restrictions for operators (the operator age was raised from 12 to 16 years for all affected states, with Florida also introducing a mandatory boating-safety course for those under age 18).&lt;ref name=sfty&gt;National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the State of California, these laws have directly contributed to an over-50-percent reduction in accidents.&lt;ref name=cali&gt;See footnotes to accident discussion below. California Boating and Waterways 2004 Annual Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable fatality occurred on July 1, 2012 in Little Sabine Bay (near [[Pensacola Beach]]), [[Florida]]; retired [[astronaut]] [[Alan Poindexter]] was killed when the PWC he was riding was rammed by one operated by one of his sons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/48043840/ns/today-today_tech/t/ex-astronaut-alan-poindexter-dies-jet-ski-accident/#.T_cxrtWLM4Q Ex-astronaut Alan Poindexter dies in jet ski accident]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

=== {{anchor|Reckless Driving}}Reckless driving ===
The leading cause of PWC accidents among riders in 2007 was reckless or careless driving.&lt;ref name=oseven&gt;"Boating Statistics 2006." http://www.uscgboating.org/statistics/Boating_Statistics_2007.pdf. Retrieved on December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Transportation Safety Board in the U.S., this accounted for 26.3 percent of all PWCs involved in accidents in 2007.&lt;ref name=ntsb&gt;"National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety." 1998. [http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/8000/8400/8418/SS9801.pdf] Retrieved on December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Reckless driving has been defined in the Personal Watercraft Act of 2005 in the U.S. as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Every personal watercraft shall at all times be operated in a reasonable and prudent manner. No person shall operate a personal watercraft in an unsafe or reckless manner. Unsafe personal watercraft operation shall include, but not be limited to the following:&lt;br /&gt;
 (1) Becoming airborne or completely leaving the water while crossing the wake of another vessel within [100 feet] of the vessel creating the wake. &lt;br /&gt;Or wake jumping
      (2) Weaving through congested traffic.&lt;br /&gt;
      (3) Operating a vessel at greater than slow/no wake speed within [100 feet] of an anchored or moored vessel, shoreline, vessel underway, dock, pier, boat ramp, marina, swim float, marked swim area, person in the water, person(s) engaged in angling, or any {{Sic|?|hide=y|manually|-}}propelled vessel. &lt;br /&gt;
      (4) Operating contrary to the "Rules of the Road" or following too close to another vessel, including another personal watercraft. For the purposes of this section, following too close shall be construed as proceeding in the same direction and operating at a speed in excess of [10 MPH] when approaching within [100 feet] to the rear or [50 feet] to the side of another motorboat or sailboat which is underway unless such vessel is operating in a narrow channel, in which case a personal watercraft may operate at speed and flow of other vessel traffic.&lt;ref name=nasbla&gt;NASBLA MODEL ACT FOR PERSONAL WATERCRAFT http://www.nasbla.net/pdf/Model%20Acts/new/Personal%20Watercraft%2092105.pdf. Retrieved on December 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reckless driving is defined differently by state. For example, in Florida reckless driving on a PWC is defined as "maneuvering a personal watercraft by weaving through congested vessel traffic, jumping the wake of another vessel unreasonably close or when visibility around the vessel is obstructed, or swerving at the last possible moment to avoid collision is classified as reckless operation of a vessel".&lt;ref name=florida&gt;Florida Boating Laws Basic. http://www.boatus.org/onlinecourse/statelaws/Florida.html. Retrieved on December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In U.S. law, the penalties for operating a vessel in a negligent or reckless manner are defined as following:&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) A person operating a vessel in a negligent manner or interfering with the safe operation of a vessel, so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of a person is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 in the case of a recreational vessel, or $25,000 in the case of any other vessel.&lt;br /&gt;
(b) A person operating a vessel in a grossly negligent manner that endangers the life, limb, or property of a person commits a class A misdemeanor.&lt;ref name=code&gt;"U.S. Code: Penalties for negligent operations and interfering with safe operation." https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/2302-. Retrieved on December 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== {{anchor|Driver Inattention}}Driver inattention ===
Because of the increasing popularity of water sports (particularly PWC), the number of vessels in use has increased in the last several decades. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the number of registered vessels was 8,557,857 in 1980 and 12,875,568 in 2007.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt; This has resulted in more-crowded waterways and increased hazards. Because of the increased congestion caused by the number of vessels, a heightened need for attention and caution is required by operators. In 2007, 17.2 percent of all PWC-related accidents were caused by driver inattention.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Excessive Speed}}Excessive speed ===
As the market has grown for PWC manufacturers, vessel power has also increased. Modern PWC engines have more than 250 horsepower and can reach speeds of over {{convert|70|mph}}.&lt;ref name=wave&gt;Yamaha Waverunner. http://www.yamaha-motor.com/waverunner/products/modelhome/580/0/home.aspx. Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive speed accounted for nearly 15 percent of all PWC-related accidents in 2007, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;ref name=oseven/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Off Throttle Steering}}Off-throttle steering ===
The steering characteristics of jet boats (including personal watercraft) when they are "off throttle" seem to differ from conventional steering. All recreational planing boats steer with thrust. Jet boats (including PWCs) generate that thrust with a moveable nozzle connected to a jet pump; propeller boats generate thrust through a downward-placed, exposed propeller. The fact that the propeller is placed downward in the water and is exposed means that even when it is not generating thrust that some amount of steering effect is possible. Jet boats have no downward projection, and achieve no additional steering effect from the device. If the operator of a jet boat releases the throttle, steering effectiveness decreases roughly in proportion to  thrust reduction. The NTSB related an example of an off-throttle steering accident in the personal watercraft safety study of 1998: &lt;blockquote&gt;
The Florida Marine Patrol accident description states, "[Operator] was
attempting to make a turn south through a cut in the mangroves . . . . He was not real familiar with operating a jet ski with a passenger.  When he attempted to make a left turn he let off the throttle which caused the PWC to lose steering capabilities.  The forward momentum of the PWC took [operator] and passenger into the mangrove shoreline.
[Operator] received a puncture wound to the left side of his neck . . . ."&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the NTSB, 24 percent of reported PWC accidents list steering problems or loss of control as contributing factors;&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt; in Florida, it is the second-leading cause of PWC-related accidents. PWC manufacturers have been working to develop a system to prevent off-throttle steering. Modifications have been made to solve this problem in newer PWC models.&lt;ref name=rideo&gt;Ride Technology: Off Throttle Steering http://www.ridetechnology.com/offThrottle.html. Retrieved on December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Driver inexperience}}Driver inexperience ===
Because of the ease of operating a PWC, little training and experience is required to perform basic maneuvers of a PWC. The NTSB reported in 1998 that 32 percent of operators involved in accidents reported that they had operated a vessel between zero and ten times prior to the accident; 86 never, 75 once and 225 between 2 and 10 times. Of the 712 operators who were asked about training, 84 percent said they had received no training and the other 16 percent participated in some boating training.&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt; Regulations concerning training courses and age limits for operators vary by state and by country. In the U.S. the minimum operator age ranges from 12–18 years; young operators may require adult supervision on the vessel and training in accordance with local laws.&lt;ref name=ntsb/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Conclusion}}Internal Orifice Injuries ===

One particularly serious type of personal watercraft injury occurs when a female rider falls off the back of the craft and into the path of the craft's high-pressure water jet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insiderexclusive.com/justice-in-america/dangerous-sports-the-personal-watercraft-industry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|title=www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|last=Mazzola|first=Brian|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The jet thrust is powerful enough to push water into the rider's orifices, which can result in severe internal injuries to the rider's vagina, rectum or anus, and possibly death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insiderexclusive.com/justice-in-america/dangerous-sports-the-personal-watercraft-industry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|title=www.personalwatercraftinjuries.com|last=Mazzola|first=Brian|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2014, the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District, Division One upheld in full a [[San Diego County]] jury verdict against [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] and two other defendants in favor of two plaintiffs injured simultaneously in a single 2007 fall from a PWC, which included awards, respectively, of $3.385 million and $1.063 million in compensatory damages (with liability divided in equal portions among the three defendants).&lt;ref name="Colombo"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17317476377459507274 ''Colombo v. BRP US Inc.''], 230 Cal. App. 4th 1442; 179 Cal. Rptr. 3d 580 (2014).  As the appellate court explained in its opinion, this case was delayed after the PWC owner initiated a proceeding in federal court under the [[Limitation of Liability Act of 1851]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The appellate court also affirmed awards of $1.5 million in punitive damages against BRP alone for each plaintiff (adding up to $3 million in punitive damages) which were based on the jury's express finding that BRP's conduct manifested a "reckless or callous disregard for the rights of others".&lt;ref name="Colombo" /&gt;

However, on the other hand, there are also examples where the owner, operator, and/or user of the personal watercraft have been found entirely at fault by a jury without any fault whatsoever on the manufacturer.  For example, in 2010 in a case venued in the federal court of the Middle District of Florida, a jury found the 2006 Sea-Doo safe and not defective as to design, warnings, manufacture, and that BRP was not negligent in the design of its product.  &lt;ref&gt;See Christina Thomas v. Bombardier Recreational Products, Inc., CASE NO.: 2:07-CV-00730-JES-SPC (M.D. Fla. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  BRP maintained the Sea-Doo was reasonably safe, state-of-the-art, compliant with industry standards as well as the U.S. Coast Guard's standards, and was not the cause of plaintiff's injuries and/or accident.  The plaintiff testified she did not have any conversation with anyone concerning the use of protective gear, such as wet suit bottoms or equivalent protective clothing and was not provided any safety information before riding. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rumberger.com/?t=40&amp;an=4502&amp;format=xml&amp;p=4944&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, the operator admitted he saw, but chose not to read, the onboard warning label. He also admitted that he did not read the safety recommendations in the operator’s guide nor watch the safety video.  Counsel for BRP in the Thomas case, Scott Sarason, commented on the case that, “Statistically speaking, the probability of the type of incident involved in this case is extremely rare. Owners, operators and passengers of personal watercrafts must think safety first. It’s important for people to realize that these watercraft are classified as boats. That’s why the watercraft industry has been working diligently with authorities like the U.S. Coast Guard to introduce programs like ‘Know Before You Go’ in an effort to prevent accidents and injuries.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rumberger.com/?t=40&amp;an=4502&amp;format=xml&amp;p=4944&lt;/ref&gt; The Thomas case is just one example, of a handful, where such a rare accident is caused by extraneous persons or factors (including, but not limited to, the presence of alcohol, operator inexperience/inattention, careless or reckless operation, violation of state/local boating laws, failure on the part of the operator and/or owner to convey necessary safety information provided by the manufacturer, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15357">The '''Romanes Lecture''' is a prestigious free public lecture given annually at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]], [[Oxford]], England.

The lecture series was founded by, and named after, the biologist [[George Romanes]], and has been running since 1892. Over the years, many notable figures from the Arts and Sciences have been invited to speak. The lecture can be on any subject in science, art or literature, approved by the [[John Hood (university administrator)|Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford|University]].

'''The Day the Earth Smiled''' refers to July 19, 2013, the date on which the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' spacecraft turned to image [[Saturn]], most of its visible [[ring system]], and [[Earth]], during an [[eclipse]] of the [[Sun]]. The spacecraft had done this twice before (in 2006 and 2012) in its previous nine years in [[orbit]]. The name is also used to refer to the activities associated with the event, as well as to the [[photographic mosaic]] created from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17171 |title=Catalog Page for PIA17171 |publisher=[[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceived by the planetary scientist [[Carolyn Porco]], who was the imaging team leader for ''Cassini'', the concept called for the people of the world to reflect on their place in [[Universe|the cosmos]], to marvel at [[life]] on Earth, and, at the time the pictures were taken, to look up and smile in celebration.&lt;ref name=Porco&gt;{{cite news|last=Porco|first=Carolyn|title=NASA's Cassini Cameras to Provide Breathtaking Image of Earth from Saturn|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2013/06/celebrating-saturn.html|accessdate=2 July 2013|newspaper=[[PBS]]|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|title=People of Earth, say cheese!

==Events==

The ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]]'' probe took images of Earth from close to a billion miles away at 21:27 UTC, July 19, 2013. A number of activities were planned to celebrate the occasion:

* A website was set up as a portal to activities associated with July 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Day the Earth Smiled|url=http://thedaytheearthsmiled.com/info.php|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On it, Porco encouraged the world to celebrate life on planet Earth and humanity's accomplishments in the exploration of the solar system.
* [[Astronomers Without Borders]] coordinated events internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Day the Earth Smiled|url=http://www.astronomerswithoutborders.org/projects/the-day-the-earth-smiled.html|publisher=Astronomers Without Borders|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[NASA]] spearheaded a related event called 'Wave at Saturn' "to help acknowledge the historic interplanetary portrait as it is being taken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20040618/|title=Cassini to Take Photo of Earth from Deep Space|publisher=saturn.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=2013-06-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622053829/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/newsreleases/newsrelease20040618/|archivedate=2013-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A "Message to the Milky Way" contest was held by Porco's company, Diamond Sky Productions. People could submit a digital photo taken on July 19 and/or a musical composition. The winning entries were beamed as a message to extraterrestrials, "into the Milky Way from the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo Radio Telescope]] in Puerto Rico".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message to the Milky Way|url=http://diamondskyproductions.com/recent/index.php#mmw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the example set in 1974, when the first serious communication to alien civilizations, the [[Arecibo message]], was broadcast from Arecibo.

==Results==

Raw images from ''Cassini'' were received on Earth shortly after the event, and a couple of processed images—a high-resolution image of the Earth and the Moon, and a small portion of the final wide-angle mosaic showing the Earth—were released to the public a few days following the July 19 imaging sequence.&lt;ref name=FoxJuly22&gt;{{cite news|title=Cassini spacecraft photographs Earth from 900 million miles away|url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/07/22/day-earth-smiled/|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spinks&gt;{{cite news|last=Spinks|first=Peter|title=Earth viewed from a billion miles away|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/earth-viewed-from-a-billion-miles-away-20130726-2qo22.html|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''This Is It''' was a planned [[concert residency]] by [[Michael Jackson]] which was scheduled to begin in July 2009 and end September 29, 2009 with a second leg which was scheduled to run from January 2010 through March 2010 with a total of 50 shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-tour-balloons-to-50-show-run-stretching-into-2010-20090312&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson announced This Is It at a press conference in the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], stating that it would be his final series of concerts in London. [[AEG Live]], the concert promoters, released a promotional video that took up an entire commercial break, setting a record for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Initially, only 10 concerts were announced, but following public demand, 40 more concerts were added. Ticket sales broke several records and Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement; AEG Live estimated that the first 10&amp;nbsp;dates alone would have earned Jackson approximately £50 million. 

In preparation for the concert series, Jackson had been collaborating with high-profile figures including fashion designer [[Christian Audigier]], choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] and bodybuilder [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Prior to Jackson's death in 2009, Allgood Entertainment sued Jackson for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts; the case was dismissed.

After Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either refunds to ticket holders or a special "souvenir" ticket designed by Jackson.

There also would have been [[Aerial dance|aerial dancing]] similar to routines by [[Cirque du Soleil]].&lt;ref name = "NME 44599"/&gt; Carla Ferrigno told [[Reuters]] that [[Lou Ferrigno|her husband Lou]] had been helping Jackson train in advance of the shows.

On May 20, it was announced that the first concert would be pushed back five days to July 13 and three other July dates would be rescheduled for March 2010. AEG Live said that the delay was necessary because more time was needed for dress rehearsals. The revised schedule called for 27 shows between July 13 and September 29, 2009, followed by a three-month break, before resuming in the new year with 23 more shows between January 7 and March 6, 2010.&lt;ref name = "new dates"/&gt; Some fans petitioned for the reversal of AEG Live's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/michael-jackson/44820 |title=Michael Jackson fans launch petition over O2 Arena postponement |publisher=''NME'' |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June, several hundred seats for each of the dates were put on sale. These seats were held back until production logistics were worked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8115638.stm |title=More Jackson tickets up for sale |publisher=BBC |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested that after the London concerts, Jackson might head to [[Australia]], [[Europe]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]] before moving on to North America. Randy Phillips, the CEO of [[AEG Live]], told The LA Times that Australia was part of Michael Jackson's international tour plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |title=Michael Jackson Planning Australian Tour Before His Death |publisher=Take 40 |date=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504000236/http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |archivedate=May 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book ''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes'', after the London concerts were finished, Jackson was planning to extend his deal with AEG Live which included new music, a potential three-picture movie deal, a series of one-off concert dates starting in China, a halftime slot at one of the future [[Super Bowl]] games to surpass his own halftime show at the [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in January 1993 and two more tours (one of which was to be a final reunion with his brothers based on a promise made to their [[Katherine Jackson|mother]] to see her sons perform together one last time before she passed away). After the deal was completed, he planned to take time off from musical entertainment and move on to (possibly) directing his own film ideas, such as making a feature-length motion picture based on his 1982 song "Thriller" and [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|the music video of the same name]]. It was also later revealed that [http://www.damienshields.com/michael-jacksons-halloween-special-that-never-was/ a yearly Halloween television special] based on his horror-themed songs, such as "Thriller" and "Ghosts", was part of Jackson's deal with AEG Live.

In [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial]], David Walgren stated another one of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson under the influence of propofol on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The ''Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital''. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they could see him perform in London.

===Songs prepared===
As shown in ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'', songs prepared for the concerts included "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]", "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", a medley of songs by [[The Jackson 5]] consisting of "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" and "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Black or White]]", "[[Earth Song]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Man in the Mirror]]". Later on, "[[Stranger in Moscow]]", "[[You Are Not Alone]]", "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]", "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]", "[[Dirty Diana]]" ,"[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)|Dangerous]]", "[[We Are the World]]", "[[Heal the World]]" and "[[Will You Be There]]" were also confirmed to have been planned for the shows. Due to the larger than usual roster of songs, as well as time constraints, Jackson would perform some songs with one verse less than he did in previous tours (such as "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Jam", "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "Black or White"). "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" was rumored to have been reserved for select concerts. On the final dates, Jackson wanted to perform a ballad called "River Ripple", written by him, with an African choir and his children. During the final concert before "Man in the Mirror", Michael was slated to premiere a song called "Best of Joy", written and recorded in 2009 prior to Jackson's death. As of 2018, the full version of "River Ripple" remains unreleased (although snippets of the song have leaked on YouTube), while "Best of Joy" was officially released in 2010 on Jackson's first posthumous album of unreleased songs, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''.

==Litigation==
In June 2009, concert promoter Allgood Entertainment, represented by Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million. He claimed that Jackson, through his manager [[Frank DiLeo]], had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with [[The Jackson 5]] and his sister [[Janet Jackson]]. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented Jackson from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094537.stm |title=Jackson sued over reunion concert |publisher=BBC |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/12/michael-jackson-sued-o2-arena|title=Michael Jackson sued for O2 arena residency|publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/12/michael-jackson-comeback-concerts |title=Michael Jackson comeback concerts in jeopardy? |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating that there was no evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11038050 | work=BBC News | title=Judge dismisses Jackson reunion claim | date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was in limbo as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/nysd/347380/ |title=AllGood Entertainment, Inc. et al v.

==Jackson's death and refunds==
{{Further|Death of Michael Jackson}}

On June 25, 2009, Jackson died after going into [[cardiac arrest]] which was caused by an overdose of [[Propofol]] and [[Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]], eighteen days before his planned first show. AEG Live, who persuaded Jackson to sign up for the shows, faced a liability of up to £300 million and an empty venue for the next nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|title=O2 arena counts cost as curtain closes on the greatest show of all|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6580748.ece|publisher=The Times|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O2 arena stated that full refunds, including all ticket service charges, would be available to those who purchased tickets through authorized agents, but that "fans will have the option to be sent the actual tickets they would have received to attend the shows in lieu of the full refunds which are being offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLA Statement&amp;nbsp;— Michael Jackson|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/inside/ucla-statement-michael-jackson.html |publisher=[[The O2 Arena]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans who bought their tickets from private sellers potentially faced difficulties. eBay recommended that purchasers contact their sellers for refunds and stated that those who used PayPal can get their money back if the purchase was made during the last 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8120412.stm |title=Refund issues over Jackson gigs |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; then later stated that "all buyers on the site will receive a full refund for their ticket purchase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8122580.stm |title=eBay will refund Jackson tickets |publisher=BBC News |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">[[File:Lockerbie disaster memorial.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A memorial is often established to remember lives lost in a tragedy such as the [[Lockerbie air disaster]]]]
A '''tragedy''' is an event of great loss, usually of human life.  Such an event is said to be ''tragic''. Traditionally the event would require "some element of moral failure, some flaw in character, or some extraordinary combination of elements"&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920405&amp;slug=1484688&lt;/ref&gt; to be tragic.

Not all death is considered a tragedy. Rather it is a precise set of symptoms surrounding the loss that define it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crisis Intervention Training for Disaster Workers: An Introduction |last=Doherty |first=George W. |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=12 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of factors that define a death as ''tragic''.

An event in which a massive number of deaths occur may be seen as a tragedy. This can be re-enforced by media attention or other public outcry.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=1 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tragedy does not necessarily involve [[massacre|massive death]]. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, may be seen as a tragedy.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt; The person need not necessarily have been [[celebrity|famous]] before death.

==Factors that make death a tragedy==
Generally, the label of "tragedy" is given to an event based on public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=11 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that can make a death be considered a tragedy.

===Scope===
The scope of an event can affect the public view, and make it appear tragic. This can be the case whether the death toll is high, or if a single, unexpected death occurs in a well-beloved person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of attachment in the public eye may also impact whether or not the event is publicly labeled as a tragedy. For example, the unexpected death of a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] student that receives heavy media attention may be seen as more tragic than that of a [[recidivism|recidivist]] prisoner who is beaten to death by fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1 /&gt;

===Prematurity===
A death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. An old person dying of old age is an expectation, but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult that is not expected by others can be viewed as tragic.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Publicity]] is a factor in making the public view an event as a tragedy. With publicity of a large number of deaths or even a single death, this plays on the emotions of the general public, and thereby impacts perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=3 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of coverage affects the number of people in whose eyes the event is viewed as tragic. While local coverage may garner sympathy from those in the hometown of the deceased, international coverage may lead the whole world to mourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The resulting consequences from one or more deaths can be seen as a tragedy. For example, if a large number of persons are killed in a terrorist attack, not only is life lost, but others may lose their sense of security, and this impacts the lives of others in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
The long-term effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even long after, as they clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional; by Stephen B. Roberts, Willard W. C. Ashley; {{ISBN|978-1-59473-240-9}}; page 67&lt;/ref&gt; A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional, and National Tragedy |last=Roberts |first=Stephen B.  |authorlink= |author2=Willard W. C. Ashley  |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-59473-240-9 |page=86 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealing with tragedy==
There are various ways tragedy can affect people.

The typical reaction to tragedy is heavy [[grief]], followed by a slow recovery. Common feelings following a tragedy include [[sadness]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[crying]], [[blame]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy: A psychiatrist offers ways to deal with trauma and grief |author=Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D. |newspaper=Ebony Magazine |date=February 1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=coping+with+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jUT4TIfBFIWClAe0rvGgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=coping%20with%20tragedy&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some people wonder what they did to deserve such suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with Tragedy |last=Ramsey |first=Tara |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=33 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, their [[religion|faith]] may be a source of comfort in the wake of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith in the Fast Lane |last=Owens |first=Ken |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=106 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''use error''' has recently been introduced to replace the commonly used terms '''[[human error]]''' and '''[[user error]]'''. The new term, which has already been adopted by [[international standard]]s organizations for [[medical device]]s (see [[#Use errors in health care]] below for references), suggests that [[accident]]s should be attributed to the circumstances, rather than to the human beings who happened to be there.

==The need for the terminological change==
The term "use error" was first used in May 1995 in an [[MD+DI]] guest editorial,  [http://www.mddionline.com/article/issue-use-not-user-error “The Issue Is ‘Use,’ Not ‘User,’ Error,”] by [http://biomed.tamu.edu/people/faculty.php?lname=Hyman William Hyman].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mddionline.com/article/issue-use-not-user-error&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, human errors are considered as a special aspect of [[human factors]]. Accordingly, they are attributed to the human [[Computer operator|operator]], or [[user (computing)|user]].
When taking this approach, we assume that the system design is perfect, and the only source for the use errors is the human operator. For example, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) [[HFACS]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://uscg.mil/careercentral/cg113/docs/ergo_hfacs/hfacs.pdf], Department of Defense Human Factors Analysis and Classification System: A mishap investigation and data analysis tool&lt;/ref&gt; 
classifies use errors attributed to the human operator, disregarding improper design and configuration setting, which often result in missing [[alarms]], or in inappropriate [[alert messaging|alerting]].

The need for changing the term was due to a common [[malpractice]] of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s (the responsible organizations, the authorities, journalists) in cases of accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lu.se/upload/Trafikflyghogskolan/TR2002-01_ReInventionofHumanError.pdf], Dekker: Reinvention of Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of investing in fixing the error-prone design, management attributed the error to the users.
The need for the change has been pointed out by the accident investigators: 
* Early in 1983, Erik Hollnagel&lt;ref&gt;
[https://sites.google.com/site/erikhollnagel2/], Erik Hollnagel home page
&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the term Human Error refers to the outcome, not to the cause. A user action is typically classified as an error only if the results are painful &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ida.liu.se/~eriho/Bellagio_M.htm], Hollnagel: Why "Human Error" is a Meaningless Concept&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the story “Leap of Faith” of his book “Set Phasers on Stun”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegeanpublishing.com/phaser1.html], Steve Casey: Set Phasers on Stun&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Casey suggested that the accident of the [[Indian Airlines Flight 605]] near Bangalor in 1990 could have been avoided, should the investigators of the [[Air France Flight 296]] accident of 1988 past the Mulhouse-Habsheim airport considered the circumstances (exceptional situation), rather than the pilots (human errors).
* In his book “Managing the Risks of Organizational Accidents” ([[Organizational models of accidents]]) James Reason explained and demonstrated that often, the circumstances for accidents could have been controlled by the responsible organization, and not by the operators. 
* In his book “The Field Guide to Understanding Human Errors”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754648260],  Sidney Dekker:  The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Dekker argued that blaming the operators according to “The Old View” results in defensive behavior of operators, which hampers the efforts to learn from near-misses and from accidents.

==Use errors vs. force majeure==
A mishap is typically considered as either a use error or a force majeure:
&lt;ref name="Weiler"&gt;[http://avi.har-el.com/eng/Articles/ITS-Alarms-Apr2011.pdf], Weiler and Harel: Managing the Risks of Use Errors: The ITS Warning Systems Case Study&lt;/ref&gt;
* A use error is a mishap in which a human operator is involved. Typically, such mishaps are attributed to the failure of the human operator &lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754648260], Dekker, 2007: The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A force majeure is a mishap that does not involve a human being in the chain of events preceding the event.

==Use errors in health care==
In 1998, Cook, Woods and Miller presented the concept of [[hindsight bias]], exemplified by celebrated accidents in medicine, by a workgroup on patient safety
.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ctlab.org/documents/A%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Stories.pdf], Cook RI, Woods DD, Miller C [1998] A Tale of Two Stories: Contrasting Views of Patient Safety
&lt;/ref&gt;
The workgroup pointed at the tendency to attribute accidents in health care to isolated human failures.
They provide references to early research about the effect of knowledge of the outcome, which was unavailable beforehand, on later judgement about the processes that led up to that outcome. They explain that in looking back, we tend to oversimplify the situation that the actual practitioners faces. They conclude focusing on the hindsight knowledge prevents our understanding of the richer story, the circumstances of the human error.

According to this position, the term Use Error is formally defined in several [[international standard]]s, such as [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 62366, [[ISO 14155]] and [[ISO 14971]], to describe
: ''an act or omission of an act that results in a different medical device response than intended by the manufacturer or expected by the user.''

[[ISO standards]] about medical devices and procedures provide examples of use errors, which are attributed to human factors, include slips, [[lapses]] and mistakes. Practically, this means that they are attributed to the user, implying the user’s accountability.
The  U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] glossary of medical devices provides the following explanation about this term:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/InfusionPumps/ucm202502.htm], FDA, Medical Devices, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Safe and effective use of a medical device means that users do not make errors that lead to injury and they achieve the desired medical treatment. If safe and effective use is not achieved, use error has occurred. Why and how use error occurs is a [[human factors]] concern."

With this interpretation by ISO and the FDA, the term ‘use error’ is actually synonymous with ‘user error’.
Another approach, which distinguishes ‘use errors’ from ‘user errors', is taken by IEC 62366. Annex A includes an explanation justifying the new term:
:"This International Standard uses the concept of use error. This term was chosen over the more commonly used term of “human error” because not all errors associated with the use of medical device are the result of oversight or carelessness of the part of the user of the medical device. Much more commonly, use errors are the direct result of poor user interface design."

This explanation complies with “The New View”, which Sidney Dekker suggested as an alternative to “The Old View”. This interpretation favors investigations intended to understand the situation, rather than blaming the operators.

In a 2011 report draft on health IT usability, the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) defines "use error" in healthcare IT this way: “Use error is a term used very specifically to refer to user interface designs that will engender users to make errors of commission or omission. It is true that users do make errors, but many errors are due not to user error per se but due to designs that are flawed, e.g., poorly written messaging, misuse of color-coding conventions, omission of information, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;''NISTIR 7804: Technical Evaluation, Testing and Validation of the Usability of Electronic Health Records, Draft, Sept. 2011, pg. 10. '' [https://www.nist.gov/healthcare/usability/upload/Draft_EUP_09_28_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example of user error ===
An example of an accident due to a user error is the ecological disaster of 1967 caused by the [[Torrey Canyon]] supertanker. The accident was due to a combination of several exceptional events, the result of which was that the supertanker was heading directly to the rocks. At that point, the captain failed to change the course because the steering control lever was inadvertently set to the Control position, which disconnected the rudder from the wheel at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Casey, A memento of your service, in Set Phasers on Stun, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of user failure to handle system failure===
Examples of the second type are the [[Three Mile Island accident]] described above, the [[New York City blackout of 1977|NYC blackout]] following a storm and the chemical plant disaster in Bhopal, India ([[Bhopal Disaster]]).

==Classifying use errors==
The URM Model &lt;ref name="Task-oriented"&gt;
[http://avi.har-el.com/eng/Articles/Task-Oriented-SE.pdf], Zonnenshain &amp; Harel: Task-oriented SE, INCOSE 2009 Conference, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes use errors in terms of the user’s failure to manage a system deficiency. Six categories of use errors are described in a URM document:
#Expected faults with risky results;
#Expected faults with unexpected results;
#Expected user errors in identifying risky situations (this study);
#User Errors in handling expected faults;
#Expected errors in function selection;
#Unexpected faults, due to operating in exceptional states.

==Critics==
Erik Hollnagel argues that going from and 'old' view to a 'new' view is not enough. One should go all the way to a 'no' view. This means that the notion of error, whether user error or use error might be destructive rather than constructive. 
Instead, he proposes to focus on the performance variability of everyday actions, on the basis that this performance variability is both useful and necessary. In most cases the result is that things go right, in a few cases that things go wrong. But the reason is the same.

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 – ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 – ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 – ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 – ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.
