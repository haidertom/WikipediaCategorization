He hails from [[Tarpon Springs, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amentertainment.com/artist-booking/2-pistols |title=Biography of 2 Pistols |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |publisher=A&amp;M Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has released two albums and a number of singles and mixtapes.

== Biography ==
From a broken home, Saunders grew up being looked after by his extended family. By his teens, he became involved in local crime and in 2005 was incarcerated for eight months.&lt;ref name="DOC" /&gt; After this he became involved in music promotion and formed a group called Blood Money Union, which consisted of other DJs, producers and rappers.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

Saunders' first success in rapping had come with a self-released record called "Dirty Foot," which he wrote while still in high school&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; and distributed in the [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] area, at the urging of his cousin. After hearing it played in a local dance club and then witnessing another rapper's performance, 2 Pistols had his first chance to perform on-stage. After taking the stage and performing his own single ("Dirty Foot"), 2 Pistols' confidence in his abilities grew to a point that he began to take his chances at making a career of music seriously.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

His debut album, ''[[Death Before Dishonor (album)|Death Before Dishonor]]'', was released on June 17, 2008&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Listing at [http://www.billboard.com/artist/431860/2-pistols/chart Billboard.com], accessed October 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and featured production from the [[Grammy]]-winning [[J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]], Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E, Bolo Da Producer, and others. Other tracks from the album included "You Know Me feat. Ray J" &amp; "Thats My Word feat.Trey Songz"," in addition to "[[She Got It]]." The album peaked at #32 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, and rose to #10 on the Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop album chart.&lt;ref name="amcharts"&gt;{{cite web | title = Billboard Chart information at AllMusic.com | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1034303|pure_url=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 Pistols resides in [[Tampa, Florida]] and currently releases his music under his own label, Blood Money Union. In February 2014, the album ''Comin Back Hard'' appeared through Stage One Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hiphopsrevival.com/2014/09/03/qa-2-pistols-talks-working-with-french-montana-his-current-deal-situations-the-florida-music-scene-more/|title = Q&amp;A 2 Pistols talks working with French Montana, his current deal situations, the florida music-scene &amp; more.|date = September 3, 2014|accessdate = October 15, 2014|website = Hip Hop Revival|publisher = |last = Goodwin|first = Travis|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141021190751/http://hiphopsrevival.com/2014/09/03/qa-2-pistols-talks-working-with-french-montana-his-current-deal-situations-the-florida-music-scene-more/|archive-date = October 21, 2014|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2wenty''' is an American [[Mixed media|mixed-media]] artist and [[photographer]] from [[Los Angeles]]. He is known for using light as the central theme in his work. 2wenty comes from a background in lighting television and film which gives him an intimate understanding of how light works. The sources of light he utilizes for his light paintings are handmade, as well as creating the LED paintings by hand. His works can be viewed both nationally and internationally in Los Angeles, [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and [[London, England|London]].

== Art career ==
 [[File:Facebook Cigarettes poster by 2wenty.png|thumb|right|Facebook Social Cigarettes poster by 2wenty, 2011]]
2wenty first emerged in 2011, when his ''Facebook Social Cigarettes'' posters started appearing in technology blogs all over the internet and on the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetartsf.com/interview/artist-interview-2wenty/|title=2Wenty  Street Art SF|work=Street Art SF|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posters featured a pack of cigarettes with the [[Facebook]] logo and a tag that read, "Social Cigarettes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laist.com/2011/04/06/social_cigarettes_street_artist_adm.php|title='Social Cigarettes' Street Artist Admits Facebook Addiction|work=LAist|accessdate=29 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803150238/http://laist.com/2011/04/06/social_cigarettes_street_artist_adm.php|archivedate=3 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created over one hundred of the posters, comparing [[Facebook]] consumption with that of "cancer sticks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/facebook-street-art-2wenty-forbes-kashmir-hill_b26020|title=FishbowlLA|work=mediabistro.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2wenty also created three-dimensional versions of the posters, complete with a surgeon general warning, "[[Facebook]] may cause loss of time, poor work ethic, obesity, social disorder and possible interference of destiny. Use at your own risk."

2wenty has had multiple collaborations with fellow aritst, [[Gregory Siff]],  in addition to This Means Mar. In December 2013, 2wenty was invited by Mar to show and create one of his "signature" light paintings at his solo show 'I Crave Love',  which was held at Lab Art Gallery in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shophex.com/blog/events/hex-x-i-crave-love-a-solo-show-by-this-means-mar-at-lab-art/ |title=I Crave Love: A Solo Show At Lab Art LA, Shop Hex Blog, December 2013 |access-date=2015-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130424/http://www.shophex.com/blog/events/hex-x-i-crave-love-a-solo-show-by-this-means-mar-at-lab-art/ |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labartgallery.com/blog/2011/12/21/this-means-mar/ This Means Mar]&lt;/ref&gt;

2wenty expands his oeuvre into [[Light painting|light painting photography]]. Through long exposures, the camera captures not only the subject, but also the source of light the artist moves across his "canvas". Within these detailed images," There is a depth and other worldliness that records both place and passage of time", says 2wenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaklandartmurmur.org/events/between-paint-and-light-2wenty-and-gregory-siff-at-loakal-2013-06-01/|title=Between Paint and Light: 2wenty and Gregory Siff at Loakal|work=oaklandartmurmur.org|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leveledmag.com/2012/09/light-drawing-photography-by-2wenty/ Light Drawing Photography by 2wenty]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''9ice''' (born '''Abolore Ajifolajifaola Adegbola Akande''', on 17 January 1980){{citation needed|date=April 2013}} is a Nigerian musician. He is a south-westerner from [[Ogbomoso]] in [[Oyo State]] but he grew up in the district of [[Bariga]] in [[Lagos]].

9ice won the award for Best Hip Hop Artist at the [[MTV Africa Music Awards 2008#Best Hip-Hop|MTV Africa Music Awards]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerians sweep MTV Africa awards|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7744492.stm|accessdate=13 February 2016|work=BBC News|date=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[The Headies 2008|third edition of the Hip Hop World Awards]] held in Nigeria, he won the [[The Headies Award for Hip Hop World Revelation of the Year|Revelation of the Year award]] and  [[The Headies Award for Best Vocal Performance (Male)|Best Male Vocal Performer]]. A month later at the first SoundCity Music Video Awards, he was nominated in the category of Best New Artist. 9ice's biggest single is titled "Gongo Aso". He is the founder of [[Alapomeji Records]].

In 2014, 9ice revealed that he was going to contest for a political office in his native Ogbomosho in Oyo state. He joined the All Progressive Congress (APC) and declared his interest to contest for a seat at the Federal House of Representatives. He lost out during the primaries. 9ice was  named as a Special Adviser to the Oyo state Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi.

==Growing up==
9ice attended Abule Okuta Primary School and [[CMS Grammar School, Lagos|CMS Grammar School]], and dropped out from his law course at the [[Lagos State University]] to concentrate on music. He grew up in a [[Polygamy|polygamous]] home of five wives and nine children. His parents found about his singing career a year after it started around 2000. Before then, 9ice wrote his own songs, beginning at age 14. As a big fan of Pasuma Wonder, he kick-started his singing career with [[Fuji music]].  He derives his inspiration from his environment, and music from the likes of [[Ebenezer Obey]], [[King Sunny Adé]], Tatalo Alamu, the late Alhaji Ayinla Omowura, and the late Alhaji Haruna Ishola.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Early career==
After recording his first demo, 9ice joined the group Mysterious Boys, with whom he did a couple of tracks before going on to form his own, now defunct, group, Abinibi. Having recorded his first demo, titled ''Risi De Alagbaja'', in 1996, and his first solo song, "Little Money" in 2000, 9ice had to wait until 2005 before gaining recognition in the [[Nigerian music]] market.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The first major break for 9ice came from his first single, "Little Money". Soon after this, he did collaborations with different Nigerian artists that  prompted the release of another hit single, "Ganja Man". ID Cabasa produced this single,  which was released with other songs in March 2006. The [[reggae]] tone and playful style of the song made it an instant hit. 9ice later founded his own record company and released all other albums under that label, Alapomeji Records.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Solo album and sophomore break==
9ice's first album did well, and included the songs "Little Money", "Ganja Man", "Make Dem Talk" and "Music Daddy". ''Gongo Aso'', his second album, included songs covering success, originality, partying and women, as well as themes on the institution of marriage and gratitude. He has eight studio albums to his name which includes; Certificate (2007), Gongo Aso  (2008), Tradition (2009), Versus (2011) Bashorun Gaa (2011), Deluxe Version Versus &amp; Bashorun Gaa (2011), CNN/GRA (2014) and ID Cabasa (2016).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pulse.ng/buzz/9ice-singer-releases-8th-studio-album-titled-id-cabasa-id5792433.html&lt;/ref&gt;
He is recognized to be the first Nigerian hip-hop artist to release two albums in a year which are C.N.N (Canceling Numerous Negativity) and G.R.A (Galvanizing Right Ahead).

==Live shows==
Since late 2007 9ice has featured prominently across Nigerian campuses in the Soundcity/MTN Campus Blast tours; Lets Go There Tour With Ariya Entertainment in NY, LA, Chicago, Houston, Maryland in 2008; [[Star Mega Jam]] in 2007-2010; and London [[Troxy]] in 2008 and 2010. 9ice performed at the [[Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute]] concert (singing "Gongo Aso") in London on 27 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7475962.stm |title=Reporter's log, Mandela concert |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=1 July 2008 |date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these shows and concerts were sold-out events. He also headlined sold-out shows in the Netherlands and Malaysia in October 2010 to mark his country's 50-year anniversary of independence. In 2010, 9ice embarked on a European tour through parts of Italy, Spain and Switzerland. He also performed live in [[Cyprus]] at Lions Garden, where many  Nigerian students were in attendance.

==His style==
9ice is known for his use of the [[Yoruba language]] in his music, and he sometimes mixes Yoruba proverbs with English, broken English, Hausa and Igbo. 9ice compares himself to [[Youssou N'Dour]], who has won a couple of [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] awards  with music recorded in his mother tongue, and [[Yvonne Chaka Chaka]], whose music has also embraced her language. 9ice has been quoted as saying, "English language has been imposed on us but God graciously gave Yoruba language to us."

In January 2014, 9ice announced plans to run for a political office in 2015 as a House of Representatives member representing the Ogbomoso North Constituency, Oyo state in the National Assembly. He contested for the seat under the umbrella of the APC but lost at the party primaries.

In April 2015, the “Gongo Aso” singer was appointed a special adviser to the governor of Oyo state, Abiola Ajimobi.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Content==
It deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a terminally ill university professor at a small Midwestern college,, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

[[File:Sisyphus by von Stuck.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Sisyphus]], the symbol of the absurdity of existence, painting by [[Franz Stuck]] (1920)]]

&lt;!-- Do not edit the definition of Absurdism without first discussing on the Talk page - thank you for helping to maintain a neutral point of view --&gt;

In [[philosophy]], "'''the Absurd'''" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|inherent value]] and [[meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously. 

As a philosophy, '''absurdism''' furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher [[Albert Camus]] stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Camus|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Camus|title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-679-73373-6|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism shares some concepts, and a common theoretical template, with [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]. It has its origins in the work of the 19th-century [[Denmark|Danish]] philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard|existentialist philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Stewart, Jon (2011). Kierkegaard and Existentialism. Farnham, England: Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-1-4094-2641-7}}. pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon |title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. The aftermath of [[World War II]] provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of [[France]].

{{Also|Existentialism#The Absurd}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the [[meaning (existential)|meaninglessness]] of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942), respectively:

*[[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option. Camus states that it does not counter the Absurd. Rather, in the act of ending one's existence, one's existence only becomes more absurd.
*[[Religious]], [[spirtuality|spiritual]], or abstract belief in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] realm, being, or idea: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires an irrational but perhaps necessary religious "leap" into the intangible and empirically unprovable (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution, and others, as "philosophical suicide".
*Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution, believing that by accepting the Absurd, one can achieve the greatest extent of one's freedom. By recognizing no religious or other moral constraints, and by revolting against the Absurd (through meaning-making) while simultaneously accepting it as unstoppable, one could find contentment through the transient personal meaning constructed in the process. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1941}} Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to existentialism and nihilism==
Absurdism originated from (as well as alongside) the 20th-century strains of [[existentialism]] and [[nihilism]]; it shares some prominent starting points with both, though also entails conclusions that are uniquely distinct from these other schools of thought. All three arose from the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the Absurd: the apparent meaninglessness in a world in which humans, nevertheless, are compelled to find or create meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H3 |title=Nihilism |author=Alan Pratt |date=April 23, 2001 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=[[Embry-Riddle University]] |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three schools of thought diverge from there. Existentialists have generally advocated the individual's construction of his or her own meaning in life as well as the [[free will]] of the individual. Nihilists, on the contrary, contend that "it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9VnPgFiW0CIC&amp;oi |title=The Specter of the Absurd: Sources and Criticisms of Modern Nihilism |author=Donald A. Crosby |date=July 1, 1988 |publisher=State University of New York Press |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absurdists, following Camus's formulation, hesitantly allow the possibility for some meaning or value in life, but are neither as certain as existentialists are about the value of one's own constructed meaning nor as nihilists are about the total inability to create meaning. Absurdists following Camus also devalue or outright reject free will, encouraging merely that the individual live defiantly and authentically ''in spite of'' the psychological tension of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Camus|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=What is the Camusean alternative to suicide or hope? The answer is to live without escape and with integrity, in “revolt” and defiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic to human life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camus himself passionately worked to counter [[nihilism]], as he explained in his essay "[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]," while he also categorically rejected the label of "existentialist" in his essay "Enigma" and in the compilation ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus'', though he was, and still is, often broadly characterized by others as an existentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon|first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C. Solomon|title=From Rationalism to Existentialism: The Existentialists and Their Nineteenth Century Backgrounds |publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]] |year=2001 |page=245 |isbn=0-7425-1241-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both existentialism and absurdism entail consideration of the practical applications of becoming conscious of the truth of [[existential nihilism]]: i.e., how a driven seeker of meaning should act when suddenly confronted with the seeming concealment, or downright absence, of meaning in the universe. Camus's own understanding of the world (e.g., "a benign indifference", in ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress,{{example needed|date=November 2018}} however, sets him apart from the general existentialist trend.

Such a chart represents some of the overlap and tensions between existentialist and absurdist approaches to meaning.  While absurdism can be seen as a kind of response to existentialism, it can be debated exactly how substantively the two positions differ from each other.  The existentialist, after all, doesn't deny the reality of death.  But the absurdist seems to reaffirm the way in which death ultimately nullifies our meaning-making activities, a conclusion the existentialists seem to resist through various notions of posterity or, in Sartre's case, participation in a grand humanist project.

==Søren Kierkegaard==
{{Main|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard}}
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|Kierkegaard designed the relationship framework based (in part) on how a person reacts to [[existential despair|despair]]. Absurdist philosophy fits into the 'despair of defiance' rubric.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Sickness Unto Death''. ''Kierkegaard wrote about all four viewpoints in his works at one time or another, but the majority of his work leaned towards what would later become absurdist and theistic existentialist views.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A century before [[Albert Camus|Camus]], the 19th century Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] wrote extensively about the absurdity of the world. In his journals, Kierkegaard writes about the absurd:

{{quotation|What is the Absurd? It is, as may quite easily be seen, that I, a rational being, must act in a case where my reason, my powers of reflection, tell me: you can just as well do the one thing as the other, that is to say where my reason and reflection say: you cannot act and yet here is where I have to act... The Absurd, or to act by virtue of the absurd, is to act upon faith ... I must act, but reflection has closed the road so I take one of the possibilities and say: This is what I do, I cannot do otherwise because I am brought to a standstill by my powers of reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Dru, Alexander. ''The Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;|Kierkegaard, Søren|Journals|1849}}

Here is another example of the Absurd from his writings: {{Quotation|What, then, is the absurd? The absurd is that the eternal truth has come into existence in time, that God has come into existence, has been born, has grown up. etc., has come into existence exactly as an individual human being, indistinguishable from any other human being, in as much as all immediate recognizability is pre-Socratic paganism and from the Jewish point of view is idolatry.&lt;br&gt;—Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', 1846, Hong 1992, p. 210}}

How can this absurdity be held or believed? Kierkegaard says: {{Quotation|I gladly undertake, by way of brief repetition, to emphasize what other pseudonyms have emphasized. The absurd is not the absurd or absurdities without any distinction (wherefore Johannes de Silentio: "How many of our age understand what the absurd is?"). The absurd is a category, and the most developed thought is required to define the Christian absurd accurately and with conceptual correctness. The absurd is a category, the negative criterion, of the divine or of the relationship to the divine. When the believer has faith, the absurd is not the absurd — faith transforms it, but in every weak moment it is again more or less absurd to him. The passion of faith is the only thing which masters the absurd — if not, then faith is not faith in the strictest sense, but a kind of knowledge. The absurd terminates negatively before the sphere of faith, which is a sphere by itself. To a third person the believer relates himself by virtue of the absurd; so must a third person judge, for a third person does not have the passion of faith. Johannes de Silentio has never claimed to be a believer; just the opposite, he has explained that he is not a believer — in order to illuminate faith negatively.&lt;br&gt;—''Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'' X6B 79&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Naturalthinker.com|title=Søren Kierkegaard|url=http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/X_6_B.html|accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kierkegaard provides an example in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' (1843), which was published under the pseudonym ''[[Johannes de Silentio]]''. In the story of [[Abraham]] in the Book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Abraham is told by [[God]] to [[Binding of Isaac|kill his son]] [[Isaac]]. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue of the absurd, Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties ("you cannot act"), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith ("where I have to act").&lt;ref&gt;Silentio, Johannes de. ''Fear and Trembling'', Denmark, 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'', which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym ''[[Anti-Climacus]]''. Exploring the forms of despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance.&lt;ref&gt;''Sickness Unto Death'', Ch.3, part B, sec. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening quotation reproduced at the beginning of the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.

According to Kierkegaard in his autobiography ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', most of his pseudonymous writings are not necessarily reflective of his own opinions. Nevertheless, his work anticipated many absurdist themes and provided its theoretical background.

==Albert Camus==
Though the notion of the 'absurd' pervades all [[Albert Camus]]'s writing, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' is his chief work on the subject. In it, Camus considers absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict or a "divorce" between two ideals. Specifically, he defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand&amp;nbsp;– and the silent, cold universe on the other. He continues that there are specific human experiences evoking notions of absurdity. Such a realization or encounter with the absurd leaves the individual with a choice: [[suicide]], a [[leap of faith]], or recognition. He concludes that recognition is the only defensible option.&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"/&gt;

For Camus, suicide is a "confession" that life is not worth living; it is a choice that implicitly declares that life is "too much." Suicide offers the most basic "way out" of absurdity: the immediate termination of the self and its place in the universe.

The absurd encounter can also arouse a "leap of faith," a term derived from one of Kierkegaard's early pseudonyms, ''Johannes de Silentio'' (although the term was not used by Kierkegaard himself),&lt;ref name=CC&gt;"The Kierkegaardian Leap" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard''.&lt;/ref&gt; where one believes that there is more than the rational life (aesthetic or ethical). To take a "leap of faith," one must act with the "virtue of the absurd" (as ''Johannes de Silentio'' put it), where a suspension of the ethical may need to exist. This faith has no expectations, but is a flexible power initiated by a recognition of the absurd. (Although at some point, one recognizes or encounters the existence of the Absurd and, in response, actively ignores it.) However, Camus states that because the leap of faith escapes rationality and defers to abstraction over personal experience, the leap of faith is not absurd. Camus considers the leap of faith as "philosophical suicide," rejecting both this and physical suicide.&lt;ref name=CC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, a person can choose to embrace the absurd condition. According to Camus, one's freedom&amp;nbsp;– and the opportunity to give life meaning&amp;nbsp;– lies in the recognition of absurdity. If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes, then we as individuals are truly free. "To live without appeal,"&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; as he puts it, is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively, rather than objectively. The freedom of humans is thus established in a human's natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose; to decide (or think) for him- or herself. The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence, representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right. In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone.

Camus states in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'': "Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide."&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolt" here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; "Freedom" refers to the lack of imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; "Passion" refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.

==The meaning of life==
According to absurdism, humans historically attempt to find [[Meaning of life|meaning in their lives]]. Traditionally, this search results in one of two conclusions: either that life is meaningless, or life contains within it a purpose set forth by a [[deity|higher power]]—a belief in [[God]], or adherence to some [[religion]] or other abstract concept. 

===Elusion===
Camus perceives filling the void with some invented belief or meaning as a mere "act of eluding"&amp;mdash;that is, avoiding or escaping rather than acknowledging and embracing the Absurd. To Camus, elusion is a fundamental flaw in [[religion]], [[existentialism]], and various other schools of thought. If the individual eludes the Absurd, then he or she can never confront it.
Camus also concedes that elusion is the most common.

===God===
Even with a spiritual power as the answer to meaning, another question arises: What is the purpose of a belief in God? [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] believed that there is no human-comprehensible purpose of God, making faith in God absurd itself. Camus on the other hand states that to believe in God is to "deny one of the terms of the contradiction" between humanity and the universe (and is therefore not absurd but what he calls "philosophical suicide"). Camus (as well as Kierkegaard), though, suggests that while absurdity does not lead to belief in God, neither does it lead to the denial of God. Camus notes, "I did not say 'excludes God', which would still amount to asserting".&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''Myth of Sisyphus'', p. 40, note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal meaning===
For Camus, the beauty people encounter in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning in their own lives, which may not be the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an [[irony|ironic]] distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.

===Freedom===
[[Liberty|Freedom]] cannot be achieved beyond what the absurdity of existence permits; however, the closest one can come to being absolutely free is through acceptance of the Absurd. Camus introduced the idea of "acceptance without resignation" as a way of dealing with the recognition of absurdity, asking whether or not man can "live without appeal", while defining a "conscious revolt" against the avoidance of absurdity of the world. In a world devoid of higher meaning or judicial afterlife, the human nature becomes as close to absolutely free as is humanly possible.

===Hope===
The rejection of hope, in absurdism, denotes the refusal to believe in anything more than what this absurd life provides. Hope, Camus emphasizes, however, has nothing to do with despair (meaning that the two terms are not [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]]s). One can still live fully while rejecting hope, and, in fact, can only do so ''without'' hope. Hope is perceived by the absurdist as another fraudulent method of evading the Absurd, and by not having hope, one is motivated to live every fleeting moment to the fullest. In the words of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]'s [[epitaph]]: "I hope for nothing.  I fear nothing.  I am free."

===Integrity===
The absurdist is not guided by [[morality]], but rather, by their own [[integrity]]. The absurdist is, in fact, [[Amorality|amoral]] (though not necessarily [[Morality|immoral]]). The Absurdist's view of morality implies an unwavering sense of definite right and wrong at all times, while integrity implies honesty with one's self and consistency in the motivations of one's actions and decisions.

An '''agent-based model''' ('''ABM''') is a class of [[computational models]] for [[computer simulation|simulating]] the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of [[game theory]], [[complex systems]], [[emergence]], [[computational sociology]], [[multi-agent system]]s, and [[evolutionary programming]]. [[Monte Carlo method]]s are used to introduce randomness.  Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called '''individual-based models''' ('''IBMs'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimm |first1=Volker |first2=Steven F. |last2=Railsback |title=Individual-based Modeling and Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2005 |pages=485 |isbn=978-0-691-09666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including [[biology]], ecology and [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |year=2011 |title=Agent-based Computing from Multi-agent Systems to Agent-Based Models: A Visual Survey |journal=Scientometrics |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=479–499 |doi=10.1007/s11192-011-0468-9 |url=http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012005027/http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes|arxiv=1708.05872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of '''[[multi-agent system]]s''' or '''multi-agent simulation''' in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"/&gt;

Agent-based models are a kind of [[Microscale and macroscale models|microscale model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Leif |last1=Gustafsson |first2=Mikael |last2=Sternad |year=2010 |title=Consistent micro, macro, and state-based population modelling |journal=Mathematical Biosciences |volume=225 |issue=2 |pages=94–107 |doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2010.02.003 |pmid=20171974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of [[emergence]] from the lower (micro) level of systems to a higher (macro) level. As such, a key notion is that simple behavioral rules generate complex behavior. This principle, known as [[KISS principle|K.I.S.S.]] ("Keep it simple, stupid"), is extensively adopted in the modeling community. Another central tenet is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |title=Agent-Based Models of Industrial Ecosystems |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=October 6, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience "learning", adaptation, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_3/7280 |title=Agent-based modeling: Methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |pages=7280–7 |date=May 14, 2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=E. |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as [[computer simulation]]s, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.

==History==
The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.

===Early developments===
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed [[cellular automata]].
Another advance was introduced by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].  He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

===1970s and 1980s: the first models===

One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was [[Thomas Schelling]]'s segregation model,&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |title=Dynamic Models of Segregation |year=1971 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–186 |url=http://zolaist.org/wiki/images/c/cf/Models_of_Segregation.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discussed in his paper "Dynamic Models of Segregation" in 1971.  Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.

In the early 1980s, [[Robert Axelrod]] hosted a tournament of [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner.  Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from [[ethnocentrism]] to the dissemination of culture.&lt;ref name="Axelrod_1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Axelrod |given=Robert |authorlink=Robert Axelrod |year=1997 |title=The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01567-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the late 1980s, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]' work on [[flocking behavior|flocking]] models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

The first use of the word "agent" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down.  One candidate appears to be [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] and John H. Miller's 1991 paper "Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory",&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=J.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.H. |title=Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory |year=1991 |journal=American Economic Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=365–71 |url=http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027152415/http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs.

At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT).  This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).

===1990s: expansion===
With the appearance of StarLogo in 1990, [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] and [[NetLogo]] in the mid-1990s and [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] and [[AnyLogic]] in 2000, or GAMA&lt;ref&gt;[http://gama-platform.org/ GAMA]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 as well as some custom-designed code, modelling software became widely available and the range of domains that ABM was applied to, grew.  Bonabeau (2002) is a good survey of the potential of agent-based modeling as of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonabeau |first=Eric |title=Agent-based modeling: methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=7280–7287 |year=2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, [[Sugarscape]], developed by
[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joshua M. |last1=Epstein |authorlink1=Joshua M. Epstein |first2=Robert |last2=Axtell |authorlink2=Robert Axtell |title=Growing artificial societies: social science from the bottom up |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=October 11, 1996 |pages=224 |isbn=978-0-262-55025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable 1990s developments included [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Kathleen Carley]] ABM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/construct/index.php |title=Construct |publisher=Computational Analysis of Social Organizational Systems |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture.
During this 1990s timeframe [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the ''[[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]'' (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal ''[[Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling]]'' (CASM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casmodeling.com Springer Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal (CASM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks.  CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling.  Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Designing Organizations |journal=OR/MS Today |date=December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Agents of Change |journal=OR/MS Today |date=February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-8-06/fragent.html |last1=Samuelson |first1=Douglas A. |last2=Macal |first2=Charles M. |title=Agent-Based Modeling Comes of Age |journal=OR/MS Today |date=August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form [[INFORMS]], and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS).  Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining [[National Science Foundation]] funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS.  She was succeeded by David Sallach of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and then by Michael Prietula&lt;ref&gt;[http://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/academic_areas/isom/prietula_michael.html Michael Prietula]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Emory University]]. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the [[European Social Simulation Association]] (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized.  As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally.  The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with [[George Mason University]] taking the lead role in local arrangements.

===2000s and later===

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sun |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Sun |title=Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0-521-83964-5 |isbn=978-0-521-83964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at [[UCLA]] have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making.  Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 2014, Sadegh Asgari from [[Columbia University]] and his colleagues developed an agent-based model of the construction competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Developing a Virtual Laboratory for Construction Bidding Environment Using Agent-Based Modeling |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |date=2014-10-06 |pages=04014105 |volume=29 |issue=6 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000440 |first=R. |last=Awwad |first2=S. |last2=Asgari |first3=A. |last3=Kandil}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his model was used to analyze the low-bid lump-sum construction bids, it could be applied to other bidding methods with little modifications to the model.

==Theory==
Most computational modeling research describes systems in [[Steady state|equilibrium]] or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior.  The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, [[emergence]], and [[complexity]].

Agent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity.  Typically agents are
[[situated]] in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in [[algorithm]]ic form in computer programs.  In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful.  In ecological ABM (often referred to as "individual-based models" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be "purposeful" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).
The modeling process is best described as [[inductive reasoning|inductive]]. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.

In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, [[power-law distributions]] in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.

Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.

===Framework===
Recent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |volume=1 |pages=12 |doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A.

# Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components.
# Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers.
# Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines.

===Organizational ABM: agent-directed simulation===

The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely "Systems for Agents" and "Agents for Systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmaz/ADS.html |title=Agent-Directed Simulation |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).

==Implementation==

Many agent-based modeling software are designed for serial [[Von Neumann architecture|von-Neumann computer architectures]]. This limits the speed and scalability of these systems. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units [[GPU]]s for ABM simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Isaac Rudomin |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |title=Large Crowds in the GPU |year=2006 |publisher=[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] |accessdate=|display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111054342/https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |archivedate=January 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roshan M. |last=D'Souza |url=http://www.me.mtu.edu/~rmdsouza/ABM_GPU.html |title=Mega-Scale Interactive Agent-Based Model Simulations on the GPU |publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Richmond |first2=Daniela M. |last2=Romano |url=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090115220835/http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 15, 2009 |format=PDF |title=Agent Based GPU, a Real-time 3D Simulation and Interactive Visualisation Framework for Massive Agent Based Modelling on the GPU |journal=Proceedings International Workshop on Super Visualisation (IWSV08) |year=2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.

As an example of V&amp;V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |first3=Mario |last3=Kolberg |title=Verification and Validation of Agent-Based Simulations using the VOMAS approach |journal=Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation '09 (MASS '09), as Part of MALLOW 09, Sep 7–11, 2009, Torino, Italy |url=http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052017/http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. The agents in the multi-agent system are able to gather data by generation of logs as well as provide run-time validation and verification support by watch agents and also agents to check any violation of invariants at run-time. These are set by the Simulation Specialist with help from the SME ([[subject-matter expert]]). Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Qasim |last2=Siddique |first3=Amir |last3=Hussain |first4=Mario |last4=Kolberg |title=Verification &amp; Validation of an Agent-Based Forest Fire Simulation Model |journal=Proceedings of the Agent Directed Simulation Symposium 2010, as Part of the ACM SCS Spring Simulation Multiconference |pages=142–149 |date=April 11–15, 2010 |url=http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083937/http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOMAS provides a formal way of validation and verification. To develop a VOMAS, one must design VOMAS agents along with the agents in the actual simulation, preferably from the start. In essence, by the time the simulation model is complete, one can essentially consider it to be one model containing two models:
# An agent-based model of the intended system
# An agent-based model of the VOMAS

Unlike all previous work on verification and validation, VOMAS agents ensure that the simulations are validated in-simulation i.e. even during execution. In case of any exceptional situations, which are programmed on the directive of the Simulation Specialist (SS), the VOMAS agents can report them. In addition, the VOMAS agents can be used to log key events for the sake of debugging and subsequent analysis of simulations. In other words, VOMAS allows for a flexible use of any given technique for the sake of verification and validation of an agent-based model in any domain.

Details of validated agent-based modeling using VOMAS along with several case studies are given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

In [[philosophy]], '''being''' means the existence of a thing. Anything that exists has being. [[Ontology]] is the branch of philosophy that studies being. Being is a concept encompassing [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] features of [[reality]] and [[existence]]. Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this usage is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "[[human being]]"). The notion of "being" has, inevitably, been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in Western philosophy with attempts among the [[pre-Socratics]] to deploy it intelligibly. The first effort to recognize and define the concept came from [[Parmenides]], who famously said of it that "what is-is". Common words such as "is", "are", and "am" refer directly or indirectly to being.

As an example of efforts in recent times, [[Martin Heidegger]] (who himself drew on ancient Greek sources) adopted after German terms like ''[[Dasein]]'' to articulate the topic.&lt;ref name="dasein1"&gt;Heidegger, the day  ''[[Being and Time|Sein und Zeit]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;27: "this entity which each of us is himself&amp;nbsp;... we shall denote by the term 'Dasein'."&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern approaches build on such continental European exemplars as Heidegger, and apply metaphysical results to the understanding of human psychology and the human condition generally (notably in the [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] tradition). By contrast, in mainstream [[Analytical philosophy]] the topic is more confined to abstract investigation, in the work of such influential theorists as [[W. V. O. Quine]], to name one of many. One of the most fundamental questions that continues to exercise philosophers is posed by [[William James]]: "How comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place?&amp;nbsp;... from nothing to being there is no logical bridge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Some problems of philosophy: a beginning of an introduction to philosophy|first=William|last=James|authorlink=William James|pages=38, 40|year=1916|location=New York|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The substantial being==

===Being and the substance theorists===
The deficit of such a bridge was first encountered in history by the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic philosophers]] during the process of evolving a classification of all beings (noun). Aristotle, who wrote after the Pre-Socratics, applies the term [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] (perhaps not originally) to ten highest-level classes. They comprise one category of substance ([[ousia]]e) existing independently (man, tree) and nine categories of accidents, which can only exist in something else (time, place). In Aristotle, substances are to be clarified by stating their [[definition]]: a note expressing a larger class (the genus) followed by further notes expressing [[Differentia|specific difference]]s (differentiae) within the class. The substance so defined was a species. For example, the species, man, may be defined as an animal (genus) that is rational (difference). As the difference is potential within the genus; that is, an animal may or may not be rational, the difference is not identical to, and may be distinct from, the genus.

Applied to being, the system fails to arrive at a definition for the simple reason that no difference can be found. The species, the genus, and the difference are all equally being: a being is a being that is being. The genus cannot be nothing because nothing is not a class of everything. The trivial solution that being is being added to nothing is only a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]: being is being. There is no simpler intermediary between being and non-being that explains and classifies being.

[[File:Being Parmenides.png|thumb|right|The Being according to [[Parmenides]] is like the mass of a sphere.]]
Pre-Socratic reaction to this deficit was varied. As [[Substance theory|substance theorists]] they accepted [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] the hypothesis that appearances are deceiving, that reality is to be reached through reasoning. [[Parmenides]] reasoned that if everything is identical to being and being is a category of the same thing then there can be neither differences between things nor any change. To be different, or to change, would amount to [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] or being non-being; that is, not existing. Therefore, being is a homogeneous and non-differentiated sphere and the appearance of beings is illusory. [[Heraclitus]], on the other hand, foreshadowed modern thought by denying existence. Reality does not exist, it flows, and beings are an illusion upon the flow.

[[Aristotle]] knew of this tradition when he began his ''Metaphysics'', and had already drawn his own conclusion, which he presented under the guise of asking what being is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle|authorlink=Aristotle|title=[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]|chapter=Book VII Section 1 (paragraph 1028b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"And indeed the question which was raised of old is raised now and always, and is always the subject of doubt, viz., what being is, is just the question, what is substance? For it is this that some assert to be one, others more than one, and that some assert to be limited in number, others unlimited. And so we also must consider chiefly and primarily and almost exclusively what that is which is in this sense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and reiterates in no uncertain terms:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Chapter VII, Section 4 (paragraph 1030a).&lt;/ref&gt; "Nothing, then, which is not a species of a genus will have an essence – only species will have it ....". Being, however, for Aristotle, is not a genus.

===Aristotle's theory of act and potency===
One might expect a solution to follow from such certain language but none does. Instead Aristotle launches into a rephrasing of the problem, the [[Potentiality and actuality|Theory of Act and Potency]]. In the definition of man as a two-legged animal Aristotle presumes that "two-legged" and "animal" are parts of other beings, but as far as man is concerned, are only potentially man. At the point where they are united into a single being, man, the being, becomes actual, or real. Unity is the basis of actuality:&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'', Book IX, Chapter 10 (paragraph 1051b).&lt;/ref&gt; "... 'being' is being combined and one, and 'not being' is being not combined but more than one." Actuality has taken the place of existence, but Aristotle is no longer seeking to know what the actual is; he accepts it without question as something generated from the potential. He has found a "half-being" or a "pre-being", the potency, which is fully being as part of some other substance. Substances, in Aristotle, unite what they actually are now with everything they might become.

==The transcendental being==
Some of Thomas Aquinas' propositions were reputedly condemned by Étienne Tempier, the local Bishop of Paris (not the Papal Magisterium itself) in 1270 and 1277,&lt;ref&gt;For text of condemnations 1277 (technically still 1276 at the date, since before 25 of March) see David Piché, La condemnation parisienne de 1277, [http://www.vrin.fr/html/main.htm?action=loadbook&amp;isbn=2711614166], parallel Latin text with his French translation, or online list Latin only with footnotes, by Hans-Georg Lundahl, [http://petitlien.com/tempier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William A. “Thomism and Its Opponents.” ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''. Ed. Joseph R. Strayer. Vol. 12. New York: Scribner, 1982. 38–45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but his dedication to the use of philosophy to elucidate theology was so thorough that he was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] in 1568. Those who adopt it are called [[Thomism|Thomists]].

===Thomistic analogical predication of being===
In a single sentence, parallel to Aristotle's statement asserting that being is substance, St. Thomas pushes away from the Aristotelian doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The metaphysical thought of Thomas Aquinas: from finite being to uncreated being|first=John F. |last=Wippel|page=75|series=Monographs of the Society for Mediaeval and Renaissance Philosophy, No. 1|year=2000|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Being is not a genus, since it is not predicated univocally but only analogically." His term for analogy is Latin ''analogia''. In the categorical classification of all beings, all substances are partly the same: man and chimpanzee are both animals and the animal part in man is "the same" as the animal part in chimpanzee. Most fundamentally all substances are matter, a theme taken up by science, which postulated one or more matters, such as earth, air, fire or water ([[Empedocles]]). In today's chemistry the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in a chimpanzee are identical to the same elements in a man.

The original text reads, ''"Although equivocal predications must be reduced to univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of the whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the generation of all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the universal efficient cause of the whole species (otherwise it would be the cause of itself, since it is contained in the species), but is a particular cause of this individual which it places under the species by way of participation. Therefore the universal cause of the whole species is not an univocal agent; and the universal cause comes before the particular cause. But this universal agent, whilst it is not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one first non-univocal analogical predication, which is being."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1013.htm#article5|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The names of God (Prima Pars, Q. 13)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If substance is the highest category and there is no substance, being, then the unity perceived in all beings by virtue of their existing must be viewed in another way. St. Thomas chose the analogy: all beings are like, or analogous to, each other in existing. This comparison is the basis of his Analogy of Being. The analogy is said of being in many different ways, but the key to it is the real distinction between existence and essence. Existence is the principle that gives reality to an essence not the same in any way as the existence: "If things having essences are real, and it is not of their essence to be, then the reality of these things must be found in some principle other than (really distinct from) their essence."&lt;ref name=Kreyche70&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyche|1959|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substance can be real or not. What makes an individual substance – a man, a tree, a planet – real is a distinct act, a "to be", which actuates its unity. An analogy of proportion is therefore possible:&lt;ref name=Kreyche70/&gt; "essence is related to existence as potency is related to act."

Existences are not things; they do not themselves exist, they lend themselves to essences, which do not intrinsically have them. They have no nature; an existence receives its nature from the essence it actuates. Existence is not being; it gives being – here a customary phrase is used, existence is a principle (a source) of being, not a previous source, but one which is continually in effect. The stage is set for the concept of God as the cause of all existence, who, as the Almighty, holds everything actual without reason or explanation as an act purely of will.

===The transcendentals===
Aristotle's classificatory scheme had included the five [[predicables]], or characteristics that might be predicated of a substance. One of these was the [[Property (philosophy)|property]], an essential universal true of the species, but not in the definition (in modern terms, some examples would be grammatical language, a property of man, or a spectral pattern characteristic of an element, both of which are defined in other ways). Pointing out that predicables are predicated [[Univocity|univocally]] of substances; that is, they refer to "the same thing" found in each instance, St. Thomas argued that whatever can be said about being is not univocal, because all beings are unique, each actuated by a unique existence. It is the analogous possession of an existence that allows them to be identified as being; therefore, being is an analogous predication.

Whatever can be predicated of all things is universal-like but not universal, category-like but not a category. St. Thomas called them (perhaps not originally) the ''transcendentia'', "[[transcendentals]]", because they "climb above" the categories, just as being climbs above substance. Later academics also referred to them as "the properties of being."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A companion to metaphysics|editor-first=Jaegwon |editor-last=Kim|editor2-first=Ernest |editor2-last=Sosa|pages=21–22|series=Blackwell Companions to philosophy|year=1995|contribution=Aquinas, St. Thomas|first=Jan A.|last=Aersten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number is generally three or four.

==Being in Islamic philosophy==
The nature of "being" has also been debated and explored in [[Islamic philosophy]], notably by [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]), [[Suhrawardi Maqtul|Suhrawardi]], and [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/personalities/msadra/mulla_sadra.php|title=Iranian Personalities: Sadr Al-Din Mohammad Shirazi|author=|date=|website=www.iranchamber.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; [[Indo-European copula|A modern linguistic approach]] which notices that [[Persian language]] has exceptionally developed two kinds of "[[Indo-European copula|is]]"es, i.e. ''ast'' ("is", as a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) and ''hast'' (as an existential "is") examines the linguistic properties of the two lexemes in the first place, then evaluates how the statements made by other languages with regard to ''being'' can stand the test of Persian frame of reference.

In this modern linguistic approach, it is noticed that the original language of the source, e.g. [[Greek language|Greek]] (like [[German language|German]] or [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]), has only one word for two concepts, ''ast'' and ''hast'', or, like [[Arabic language|Arabic]], has no word at all for either word. It therefore exploits the Persian ''hast'' (existential ''is'') versus ''ast'' (predicative ''is'' or [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) to address both Western and Islamic ontological arguments on ''being'' and ''existence''.&lt;ref&gt;Toofan, M. ''Zabān ast yā hast?''(Language: is or exists?. Ketāb-e Tehran, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

This linguistic method shows the scope of confusion created by languages which cannot differentiate between existential be and copula. It manifests, for instance, that the main theme of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'' is  ''astī'' (is-ness) rather than ''hastī'' (existence). When, in the beginning of his book, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] claims that people always talk about existence in their everyday language, without knowing what it means, the example he resorts to is: "the sky ''is'' blue" which in Persian can be ONLY translated with the use of the copula ''ast'', and says nothing about ''being'' or ''existence''.

In the same manner, the linguistic method addresses the ontological works written in Arabic. Since [[Arabic language|Arabic]], like [[Latin]] in Europe, had become the official language of philosophical and scientific works in the so-called Islamic World, the early Persian or Arab philosophers had difficulty discussing ''being'' or ''existence'', since the [[Arabic language]], like other Semitic languages, had no verb for either predicative "be" ([[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]) or existential "be". So if you try to translate the aforementioned [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s example into Arabic it appears as السماء زرقاء (viz. "The Sky-- blue") with no linking "is" to be a sign of existential statement. To overcome the problem, when translating the [[ancient Greek philosophy]], certain words were coined like ایس ''aysa'' (from Arabic لیس ''laysa'' 'not') for '[[Indo-European copula|is]]'. Eventually the Arabic verb وجد ''wajada'' (to find) prevailed, since it was thought that whatever is existent, is to be "''found''" in the world. Hence ''existence'' or Being was called وجود ''wujud'' (Cf. [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''finns'' [found]&gt; there exist; also the [[Medieval Latin]] coinage of ''exsistere'' 'standing out (there in the world)' &gt; appear&gt; exist).&lt;br /&gt;  Now, with regard to the fact that Persian, as the mother tongue of both [[Avicenna]] and [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], was in conflict with either Greek or Arabic in this regard, these philosophers should have been warned implicitly by their mother tongue not to confuse two kinds of linguistic beings (viz. [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] vs. existential). In fact when analyzed thoroughly, [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], or Persian ''ast'' ('is') indicates an ever-moving chain of relations with no fixed ''entity'' to hold onto (every ''entity'', say A, will be dissolved into "A is B" and so on, as soon as one tries to define it). Therefore, the whole reality or what we see as existence ("found" in our world) resembles an ever-changing world of ''astī'' (is-ness) flowing in time and space. On the other hand, while Persian ''ast''  can be considered as the 3rd person singular of the verb 'to be', there is no verb but an arbitrary one supporting ''hast'' ('is' as an existential be= exists) has neither future nor past tense and nor a negative form of its own: ''hast'' is just a single untouchable lexeme. It needs no other linguistic element to be complete (''Hast.'' is a complete sentence meaning "s/he it exists"). In fact, any manipulation of the arbitrary verb, e.g. its conjugation, turns ''hast'' back into a copula.

Eventually from such linguistic analyses, it appears that while ''astī'' (is-ness) would resemble the world of [[Heraclitus]], ''hastī'' (existence) would rather approaches a metaphysical concept resembling the [[Parmenides|Parmenidas]]'s interpretation of ''existence''.

In this regard, [[Avicenna]], who was a firm follower of [[Aristotle]], could not accept either Heraclitian ''is-ness'' (where only constant was ''change''), nor Parmenidean ''monist immoveable existence'' (the ''hastī'' itself being constant). To solve the contradiction, it so appeared to Philosophers of Islamic world that [[Aristotle]] considered the core of existence (i.e. its ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'') as a fixed constant, while its facade ([[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]) was prone to change. To translate such a philosophical image into Persian it is like having ''hastī'' (existence) as a unique constant core covered by ''astī'' (is-ness) as a cloud of ever-changing relationships. It is clear that the Persian language, deconstructs such a composite as a sheer mirage, since it is not clear how to link the interior core (existence) with the exterior shell (is-ness). Furthermore, ''hast'' cannot be linked to anything but itself (as it is self-referent).

The argument has a theological echos as well: assuming that God is the ''Existence'', beyond time and space, a question is raised by philosophers of the Islamic world as how he, as a transcendental existence, may ever create or contact a world of ''is-ness'' in space-time.

However, [[Avicenna]] who was more philosopher than theologian, followed the same line of argumentation as that of his ancient master, [[Aristotle]], and tried to reconcile between ''ast'' and ''hast'', by considering the latter as higher order of existence than the former. It is like a hierarchical order of existence. It was a philosophical [[Tower of Babel]] that the restriction of his own mother tongue (Persian) would not allow to be built, but he could maneuver in Arabic by giving the two concepts the same name ''wujud'', although with different attributes. So, implicitly, ''astī'' (is-ness) appears as ممکن الوجود "momken-al-wujud" (contingent being), and ''hastī'' (existence) as واجب الوجود "wājeb-al-wujud" (necessary being).

On the other hand, centuries later, [[Mulla Sadra|Sadrā]], chose a more radical route, by inclining towards the reality of ''astī'' (is-ness),  as the true mode of existence, and tried to get rid of the concept of ''hastī'' (existence as fixed or immovable). Thus, in his philosophy, the universal movement penetrates deep into the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ''[[Substance theory|substance]]''/''[[essence]]'',  in unison with changing [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]].  He called this deep existential change حرکت جوهری ''harekat-e jowhari'' (Substantial Movement). In such a changing existence, the whole world has to go through instantaneous annihilation and recreation incessantly, while as [[Avicenna]] had predicted in his remarks on Nature, such a universal change or substantial movement would eventually entail the shortening and lengthening of time as well which has never been observed. This logical objection, which was made on Aristotle's argumentation, could not be answered in the ancient times or medieval age, but now it does not sound contradictory to the real nature of Time (as addressed in relativity theory), so by a reverse argument, a philosopher may indeed deduce that everything is changing (moving) even in the deepest core of Being.

==Being in the Age of Reason==
Although innovated in the late [[medieval]] period, Thomism was dogmatized in the [[Renaissance]]. From roughly 1277 to 1567, it dominated the philosophic landscape. The [[rationalist]] philosophers, however, with a new emphasis on [[Reason]] as a tool of the intellect, brought the classical and medieval traditions under new scrutiny, exercising a new concept of [[doubt]], with varying outcomes. Foremost among the new doubters were the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], the advocates of [[scientific method]], with its emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and reliance on evidence gathered from sensory experience. In parallel with the [[revolution]]s against rising political [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] based on [[established religion]] and the replacement of [[faith]] by reasonable faith, new systems of metaphysics were promulgated in the lecture halls by charismatic professors, such as [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Hegel]]. The late 19th and 20th centuries featured an emotional return to the concept of existence under the name of [[existentialism]]. These philosophers were concerned mainly with ethics and religion. The metaphysical side became the domain of the [[phenomenalism|phenomenalists]]. In parallel with these philosophies Thomism continued under the protection of the Catholic Church; in particular, the [[Jesuit order]].

===Empiricist doubts===
[[Rationalism]] and [[empiricism]] have had many definitions, most concerned with specific schools of philosophy or groups of philosophers in particular countries, such as Germany. In general rationalism is the predominant school of thought in the multi-national, cross-cultural [[Age of reason]], which began in the century straddling 1600 as a conventional date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=age of reason|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/age+of+reason|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; empiricism is the reliance on sensory data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=empiricism|encyclopedia=dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism|accessdate=9 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090125191857/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/empiricism| archivedate= 25 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; gathered in experimentation by scientists of any country, who, in the Age of Reason were rationalists. An early professed empiricist, [[Thomas Hobbes]], known as an eccentric denizen of the court of [[Charles II of England]] (an "old bear"), published in 1651 ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', a political treatise written during the [[English civil war]], containing an early [[manifesto]] in English of rationalism.
Hobbes said:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=18, 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things....When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the "names agreed upon"). He goes on to define error as self-contradiction of definition ("an absurdity, or senselesse Speech"&lt;ref name=hobbes23&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or conclusions that do not follow the definitions on which they are supposed to be based. Science, on the other hand, is the outcome of "right reasoning," which is based on "natural sense and imagination", a kind of sensitivity to nature, as "nature it selfe cannot erre."

Having chosen his ground carefully Hobbes launches an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] attack on [[metaphysics]]. The academic philosophers had arrived at the [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|Theory of Matter and Form]] from consideration of certain natural [[paradox]]es subsumed under the general heading of the Unity Problem. For example, a body appears to be one thing and yet it is distributed into many parts. Which is it, one or many? Aristotle had arrived at the real distinction between [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]], metaphysical components whose interpenetration produces the paradox. The whole unity comes from the substantial form and the distribution into parts from the matter. Inhering in the parts giving them really distinct unities are the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental forms]]. The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.

If nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural sense and imagination, are not subject to absurdity" and "For error is but a deception ... But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable. And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd ...." Among Hobbes examples are "round quadrangle", "immaterial substance", "free subject."&lt;ref name=hobbes23/&gt; Of the scholastics he says:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=501}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as "the Error of Separated Essences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The words "Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like" add no meaning to an argument nor do derived words such as "Entity, Essence, Essentially, Essentiality", which "are the names of nothing"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=498–499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but are mere "Signes" connecting "one name or attribute to another: as when we say, ''"a man is a living body"'', we mean not that the ''man'' is one thing, the ''living body'' another, and the ''is'', or ''being'' a third: but that the ''man'', and the ''living body'', is the same thing; ..."  Metaphysiques, Hobbes says, is "far from the possibility of being understood" and is "repugnant to natural reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|pp=496–497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being to Hobbes (and the other empiricists) is the physical universe:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbes|1651|p=497}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The world, (I mean ... the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimension of magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body ... and consequently every part of the Universe is Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: and because the Universe is all, that which is no part of it is nothing; and consequently no where."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes' view is representative of his tradition. As Aristotle offered the categories and the act of existence, and Aquinas the analogy of being, the rationalists also had their own system, the [[great chain of being]], an interlocking hierarchy of beings from God to dust.

===Idealist systems===
In addition to the [[materialism]] of the empiricists, under the same [[aegis]] of Reason, rationalism produced systems that were diametrically opposed now called [[idealism]], which denied the reality of [[matter]] in favor of the reality of [[mind]]. By a 20th-century classification, the idealists ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]] and others), are considered the beginning of [[continental philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fritzman|first=J. M.|date=2011-10-12|title=Review of Kant, Kantianism, and Idealism: The Origins of Continental Philosophy|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/kant-kantianism-and-idealism-the-origins-of-continental-philosophy/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the empiricists are the beginning, or the immediate predecessors, of [[analytical philosophy]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/analytic-philosophy|title=Analytic philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Being in continental philosophy and existentialism==
Some philosophers deny that the concept of "being" has any meaning at all, since we only define an object's existence by its relation to other objects, and actions it undertakes. The term "I am" has no meaning by itself; it must have an action or relation appended to it. This in turn has led to the thought that "being" and [[nothing]]ness are closely related, developed in [[Existentialism|existential]] philosophy.

[[Existentialism|Existentialist]] philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], as well as [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] have also written extensively on the concept of being. Hegel distinguishes between the being of objects ([[being in itself]]) and the being of people (''[[Geist (philosophy)|Geist]])''.  Hegel, however, did not think there was much hope for delineating a "meaning" of being, because being stripped of all predicates is simply nothing.

Heidegger, in his quest to re-pose the original pre-Socratic question of Being, wondered at how to meaningfully ask the question of the meaning of being, since it is both the greatest, as it includes everything that is, and the least, since no particular thing can be said of it.  He distinguishes between different modes of beings: a privative mode is [[present-at-hand]], whereas beings in a fuller sense are described as [[ready-to-hand]].  The one who asks the question of Being is described as Da-sein ("there/here-being") or '''[[being-in-the-world]].''' Sartre, popularly understood as misreading Heidegger (an understanding supported by Heidegger's essay "Letter on Humanism" which responds to Sartre's famous address, "Existentialism is a Humanism"), employs modes of being in an attempt to ground his concept of freedom ontologically by distinguishing between being-in-itself and being-for-itself.

Being is also understood as one's "state of being," and hence its common meaning is in the context of human (personal) [[experience]], with aspects that involve expressions and manifestations coming from an innate "being", or personal character. [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] coined the term "''[[dasein]]''" for this property of being in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]'' ("this entity which each of us is himself…we shall denote by the term 'dasein.'"&lt;ref name="dasein1"/&gt;), in which he argued that being or ''dasein'' links one's sense of one's body to one's perception of [[world]]. Heidegger, amongst others, referred to an innate language as the foundation of being, which gives [[Information|signal]] to all aspects of being.

Buddhist views, although varying on a series of [[Chinese Buddhist canon|canon]]s within the three branches of [[Buddhism]] ([[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]), observe the concept of [[euthanasia]], or "mercy killing", in a denunciatory manner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umoar.mu.edu.mm/bitstream/handle/123456789/166/The%20Response%20to%20Euthanasia.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The Response to Euthanasia from the Perspective of Buddhism, Mandalay University Research Journal 3, 188-195|last=Lin|first=Saw|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods of euthanasia include [[Voluntary euthanasia|voluntary]], [[Involuntary euthanasia|involuntary]], and [[Non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perrett RW |title=Buddhism, euthanasia and the sanctity of life |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=309–13 |date=October 1996|pmid=8910785 |pmc=1377066 |doi=10.1136/jme.22.5.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, as one school of Buddhism evolved into the next, their scriptures recorded through the oral messages of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself on Buddhist principles and values followed, guiding approximately 500 million Buddhists spanning the globe on their path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the [[Monasticism|Monastic Rule]], or [[Vinaya]], a consensus is reached by the Buddha on euthanasia and [[assisted suicide]] that expresses a lack of fondness of its practice.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keown D, Keown J |title=Killing, karma and caring: euthanasia in Buddhism and Christianity |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=265–9 |date=October 1995|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/21/5/265.full.pdf |pmid=8558539 |pmc=1376772 |doi=10.1136/jme.21.5.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddhism does not confirm that life should be conserved by implementing whatever is necessary to prolong death, but instead expresses that the intentional precipitation of death is ethically inadmissible in every condition one is presented in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Vinaya ==
The Vinaya [[Tripiṭaka|Tripitaka]] is one of three Buddhist canonical sources that makes up the Tripitaka that most relates to euthanasia. It was created to encompass a series of case laws in which Buddha provided judgement on various matters, even though the term "euthanasia" is not specifically mentioned.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monks and nuns are meant to follow the decorum that is relayed, which expresses what is considered to be wrongfully killing someone (prohibited by Buddhist precepts) by the actions of another who is conferred to follow holy orders and those who are not. Outside of Vinaya, there is no specific mention in early Buddhist texts on euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the life of Buddha, instances occurred when monks who practiced medicine were put in situations where they had to make a decision to assist in another's suicide by physically taking their life, providing the instrument used to take their life, or allowing the person to suffer, as observed in cases written in Vinaya. The Buddha, therefore, included a precept in Vinaya against the termination of another human life following the discovery that monks either took their own life or requested that others kill them because they were unhappy with their body. Buddha stated that:

{{Quote|text=Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,): "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr|title=Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha (rules for male monks), translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=access to insight|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

With this, Buddha later expanded the precept in the third [[parajika]], adding the punishment of excommunication for life from the [[Sangha]] after recognizing a number of monks provoking a patient to believe that he should choose death over life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this instance, the monks praised the idea that death was beautiful to a sick monk, persuading him to take an unrevealed measure to end his life. Because of the monk's expression of virtue, as he was informed by other monks, he would receive a good rebirth. As a result of these provocations, the monk stopped eating and later died.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues|last=Harvey|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|year=2000|isbn=978-0-511-07584-1|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.295}}

== Death and karma ==
Buddhists believe that life begins at the point of birth and ends when the individual dies. Throughout the course of the individual's life, between life and death, they are to be respected with dignity, regardless of their state of mental capacity or [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] functions. What constitutes life in a body is [[Thermoregulation|usma]] (heat), [[Vitality|ayu]] (vitality), and [[Vinnana|vinanna]] (sentiency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67323-0/abstract|title=End of life: The buddhist view.

Some consider death to be when the brain loses its functionality. And there are those who disagree with this idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Buddha passed away, according to ancient texts, his 25-year personal attendant [[Ananda]] declared him as dead. However, Ananda was later corrected by a monk senior to him, claiming that Buddha was only in a severe state of yogistic stupor. During this yogic [[trance]], Buddha lacked any vital signs of life, making it unclear for future Buddhists to determine the point of death when such physiological states exist and are relayed in Buddhist literary texts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although at death one loses all physical possessions, leaving their family, loved ones, and achievements all behind, death does not destroy all that belongs to a person. The purification of their character through virtuous and meditative practices carries over into their next life and into their mental sequence of continuation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:Traditional bhavachakra wall mural of Yama holding the wheel of life, Buddha pointing the way out.jpg|thumb|[[Yama]], Lord of Death, holding the [[Bhavacakra|Bhavachakra]] or Wheel of Life]]Buddhists hold the belief that upon death, they are reborn and will experience life through a series of lifetimes called [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] until they can cease to desire and nirvana is obtained. In conjunction with a person's previously attained karma, their state of mind at the point of death holds great importance when the determining of what kind of rebirth is to take place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are six realms of life in Buddhist cosmology: Hell realm ([[Naraka]]), hungry ghost ([[Preta]]) realm, animal realm ([[Animals in Buddhism|Tiracchānayoni]]), human realm ([[Human beings in Buddhism|Manussa]]), demi-god realm ([[Asura]]), and god realm ([[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lecso PA |title=Euthanasia: a Buddhist perspective |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51–7 |year=1986|pmid=11651853 |doi=10.1007/BF01533053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the realms that exist, the human realm is the most anticipated, yet the most difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the level of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] one garners in their current lifetime, it is determined at which realm one diverges to next upon death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first three realms (Hell realm, hungry ghost realm, and animal realm) are the most detested of the six and are meant to cause suffering, disallowing proper mental capabilities as a result of negative karma from negative acts performed during the previous life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; And although more acceptable than the former, the asura and god realm remain unfavorable as they permit one ultimate happiness but prevents the opportunity for the spirit to progress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only through good karma can one's spirit reach the human realm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Euthanasia, although it can be considered a compassionate act, is not seen in Buddhism as an act of selflessness and benevolence, but rather an act of  damage masked as help, which in turn can result in negative karma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If someone is suffering as a result of sickness, it could be a result of karma, and ending their life is not likely to end their adversity, as the suffering caused by karma will only follow them after death until its energy concludes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Compassion]] ([[karuṇā]]) is a Buddhist value that reinforces how Buddhism views standards in medicine, which is observed in all three schools of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|p.295}} Although it can be seen as morally good, committing an act through compassion is not always justified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking a life out of compassion to mitigate the affliction one experiences through illness or injury is an instance in which a person may feel he or she is vindicated to exploit euthanasia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Buddhism and the [[Bodhisattva]], it can create incongruities through the infringement of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of an unjustified act of compassion is a case written in the Vinaya, where a convicted man is hastily executed after a monk requests the executioner to do so, as to not prolong his suffering and the sorrowful period he has to wait.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A morally good scenario of compassion would be if a patient in a hospital in his or her right mind feels that their ailment is using too much of a valuable resource in limited quantities, or causing their family to spend large sums of money that is not readily available on medical bills to keep them alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Out of morally good compassion, he or she might decide to cease the sources of life preservation without pressure from others.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Had those associations been pressuring the patient to forgo further life saving treatment, this could be observed as murderous.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If the patient were terminally ill and unable to eat on their own accord, it would be a requirement of his or her associations to assist them, even if intravenous feeding was necessary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism paints life in a way that is fundamentally valuable, and it should never be surrendered for any reason, whether compassion, amity, or anything of value.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It would be an ill-advised way to show compassion rooted in misconception to endorse death using compassion as the reasoning.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vegetative state ==
According to Buddhist precepts, someone who is in a [[vegetative state]] is neither dead nor alive, but instead is said to be in some form of obscure state of mind and still a living individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They lack the necessity to rely on outside assistance to support their ability to stay alive other than being supplemented with nutrients to keep them functioning for a significant number of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With this, Buddhism sees someone in a vegetative state as a living, breathing life form, because the value in which one's life holds is not observed through individualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although Buddhism views this state of being as damaged, the individual should be treated no different than before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both animals and humans, prior to their birth as they await in the mother's womb, have value and therefore should not have their life taken from them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, some Buddhists are under the impression that an unconscious life, or one that lacks awareness, does not have value, which is highly debatable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Buddhism shows that even with a damaged physical organ, such as the brain, someone is still deserving of compassion because they are still capable of causing varying emotions in someone who cares for them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To end a life because of a patient's state of mind and to deny them treatment would be an act of abandonment, which would be considered irrational and unfair because Buddhists have a strong belief in compassion for all living things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A vegetative state can be considered a varied form of meditation where the sentience of someone acts in a way not ordinary to what is regularly observed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another form of consciousness where the body does not react is that of "formless" rebirths.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Due to these meditative states, it is often difficult to determine in a physical manner a state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The state of consciousness, at the time, may be experiencing a demonstration of going through the processes of death in ultimate preparation so that once death does come, it can receive the best form of rebirth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During this process of preparation, the eyes and other sense-organs will cease to function, but the person's sense of touch, brain function, and life force lie in the heart.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, considering the conception of meditative states, some in a vegetative state are therefore still sentient.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Being in a continuous state of vegetation is not the same as the process by which one prepares for death, even though it does resemble it.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The possibility exists for one to lack the function to breathe and think, but still be alive.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Alternatives to euthanasia ==
[[File:San Francisco Zen Center.jpg|thumb|The San Francisco Zen Center]]
Moving someone who is terminally ill into [[hospice care]] to help mitigate physical pain with [[Analgesic|pain relievers]] that is not intended to end their life, allowing them to pass away painless and comfortable, is a highly considerable alternative to euthanasia. Hospice care is meant to assist a person to have, what is called a "good death."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When one nears death, they should be able to reflect on their life peacefully. Since 1971, the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] has offered assistance to terminally ill patients, with trained hospice employees since the inception of a hospice training program in 1987. The Buddhist Hospice Trust in the United Kingdom has been an alternative to this center since its founding in 1987. Not only does it provide volunteers to visit those nearing death, but it provides an avenue for those who lost someone they cared about to receive counsel and sympathy and is also used as a center into researching death and mourning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The purpose of such a center is to truly alleviate any amount of anxiety one could experience when approaching death, leaving known loved ones behind, and to ensure a clear and calm state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hospice care employees therefore prefer not to allow a person to die in an anesthetized, unconscious state of mind.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A positive transition to a future life is best obtained when one dies with a clear conscience, free of anger, dissent, and anxiety, and in a relaxed state of being.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Buddhism, a "good death" is facilitated by family and friends, who do their best to ensure the dying person is untroubled and uplifted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[File:Red_and_blue_pill.jpg|thumb|In the film ''[[The Matrix]]'', Neo is offered the option of consuming either [[Red pill and blue pill|the red pill or the blue pill]]. Picking the red pill would result in the truth of Neo's world being revealed to him, while picking the blue pill would allow him to continue in [[ignorance]]. Thus, Neo must judge the merits of the possible outcomes of his choice.]]

'''Choice''' involves [[decision making]]. It can include [[judging]] the merits of multiple [[wikt:option|option]]s and [[wikt:select|select]]ing one or more of them. One can make a choice between imagined options ("What would I do if...?") or between real options followed by the corresponding action. For example, a traveller might choose a route for a journey based on the [[preference]] of arriving at a given destination as soon as possible. The preferred (and therefore chosen) route can then follow from information such as the length of each of the possible routes, traffic conditions, etc.  The arrival at a choice can include more complex motivators such as [[cognition]], [[instinct]], and [[feeling]].

Simple choices might include what to eat for dinner or what to wear on a Saturday morning – choices that have relatively low-impact on the chooser's [[personal life|life]] overall.  More complex choices might involve (for example) what candidate to vote for in an election, what profession to pursue, a life partner, etc. – choices based on multiple influences and having larger ramifications.

Freedom of choice is generally cherished, whereas a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing, and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome. In contrast, a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion, regret of the alternatives not taken, and indifference in an unstructured existence;&lt;ref&gt;
Barry Schwartz: ''[[The Paradox of Choice]]'' (2004)
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the illusion that choosing an object or a course, necessarily leads to the control of that object or course, can cause [[psychological]] problems.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Types==
There are four main types of decisions, although they can be expressed in different ways. [[Brian Tracy]] breaks them down into:&lt;ref&gt;''Time Power'', Brian Tracy, 2007, pg. 153 {{ISBN|0-8144-7470-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Command decisions, which can only be made by you, as the "Commander in Chief"; or owner of a company.
# Delegated decisions, which may be made by anyone, such as the [[color of the bike shed]], and should be delegated, as the decision must be made but the choice is inconsequential.
# Avoided decisions, where the outcome could be so severe that the choice should not be made, as the consequences can not be recovered from if the wrong choice is made. This will most likely result in negative actions, such as death.
# "No-brainer" decisions, where the choice is so obvious that only one choice can reasonably be made.
A fifth type, however, or fourth if avoided and "no-brainer" decisions are combined as one type, is the [[collaborative]] decision, which should be made in consultation with, and by agreement of others. Collaborative Decision Making revolutionized air-traffic safety by not deferring to the [[Pilot in command|captain]] when a lesser crew member becomes aware of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.fly.faa.gov/|title=CDM CDM - Collaborative Decision Making|author=|date=|website=cdm.fly.faa.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of looking at decisions focuses on the thought mechanism used, is the decision:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/types-of-decision-making.html|title=Types of decision making - an overview|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rational
* Intuitive
* Recognition based
* Combination

Recognizing that "type" is an imprecise term, an alternate way to classify types of choices is to look at outcomes and the impacted entity. For example, using this approach three types of choices would be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-solutions.com/types_of_decision_making.html|title=Types of Decision Making|work=decision-making-solutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Business 
* Personal
* Consumer

In this approach, establishing the types of choices makes it possible to identify the related decisions that will influence and constrain a specific choice as well as be influenced and constrained by another choice.

There are many "executive decision maker" products available, such as the decision wheels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/decision-wheels.html|title=A variety of decision wheels!|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Magic 8-Ball]], which randomly produce yes/no or other "decisions" for someone who cannot make up their mind or just wants to delegate.

A [[ouija]] board is also a delegated decision.

As a moral principle, decisions should be made by those most affected by the decision, but this is not normally applied to persons in jail, who might likely make a decision other than to remain in jail.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethical leadership in schools'', Kenneth A. Strike, 2006, pg. 5 {{ISBN|1-4129-1351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Gates]] cited this principle in allowing photographs of returning war dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/02/pentagon_report.html|title=Pentagon ends photo ban on war dead return|author=|date=|website=boston.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluability in economics==
When choosing between options one must make judgments about the quality of each option's attributes. For example, if one is choosing between candidates for a job, the quality of relevant attributes such as previous work experience, college or high school GPA, and letters of recommendation will be judged for each option and the decision will likely be based on these attribute judgments. However, each attribute has a different level of ''evaluability'', that is, the extent to which one can use information from that attribute to make a judgment.

An example of a highly evaluable attribute is the SAT score. It is widely known in the United States that an SAT score below 800 is very bad while an SAT score above 1500 is exceptionally good. Because the distribution of scores on this attribute is relatively well known it is a highly evaluable attribute. Compare the SAT score to a poorly evaluable attribute, such as the number of hours spent doing homework. Most employers would not know what 10,000 hours spent doing homework means because they have no idea of the distribution of scores of potential workers in the population on this attribute.

As a result, evaluability can cause preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations. For example, Hsee, [[George Loewenstein]], Blount &amp; Bazerman (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Hsee, C.K., Loewenstein, G.F., Blount, S., Bazerman, M.H. (1999). Preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations of option: A review and theoretical analysis. Psychological Bulletin 125(5), 576–590.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at how people choose between options when they are directly compared because they are presented at the same time or when they cannot be compared because one is only given a single option. The canonical example is a hiring decision made about two candidates being hired for a programming job. Subjects in an experiment were asked to give a starting salary to two candidates, Candidate J and Candidate S. However, some viewed both candidates at the same time (joint evaluation), whereas others only viewed one candidate (separate evaluation). Candidate J had experience of 70 KY programs, and a GPA of 2.5, whereas Candidate S had experience of 10 KY programs and a GPA of 3.9. The results showed that in joint evaluation both candidates received roughly the same starting salary from subjects, who apparently thought a low GPA but high experience was approximately equal to a high GPA but low experience. However, in the separate evaluation, subjects paid Candidate S, the one with the high GPA, substantially more money. The explanation for this is that KY programs is an attribute that is difficult to evaluate and thus people cannot base their judgment on this attribute in separate evaluation.

Personal factors determine food choice. They are [[preference]], [[association (psychology)|associations]], [[habit (psychology)|habits]], [[ethnic heritage]], [[tradition]], [[value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[social pressure]], [[emotion|emotional comfort]], [[availability]], [[convenience]], [[economy]], [[image]], [[medical conditions]], and [[nutrition]].

==Number of options and paradox==
A number of research studies in economic psychology have focused on how individual behavior differs when the choice set size (the number of choices to choose from) is low versus when it is high. Of particular interest is whether individuals are more likely to purchase a product from a large versus a small choice set. Currently, the effect of choice set size on the probability of a purchase is unclear. In some cases, large choice set sizes discourage individuals from making a choice&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar and Lepper.&lt;/ref&gt; and in other cases it either encourages them or has no effect.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Norwood, Lusk, Arunachalam, and Henneberry.&lt;/ref&gt; One study compared the allure of more choice to the tyranny of too much choice. Individuals went virtual shopping in different stores that had a randomly determined set of choices ranging from 4 to 16, with some being good choices and some being bad. Researchers found a stronger effect for the allure of more choice. However, they speculate that due to random assignment of number of choices and goodness of those choices, many of the shops with fewer choices included zero or only one option that was reasonably good, which may have made it easier to make an acceptable choice when more options were available.&lt;ref&gt;White, C. M., &amp; Hoffrage, U. (2009). Testing the tyranny of too much choice against the allure of more choice. Psychology &amp; Marketing, 26(3), 280-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that while greater choice has the potential to improve a person's welfare, sometimes there is such a thing as too much choice. For example, in one experiment involving a choice of free soda, individuals explicitly requested to choose from six as opposed to 24 sodas, where the only benefit from the smaller choice set would be to reduce the cognitive burden of the choice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A recent study supports this research, finding that human services workers indicated preferences for scenarios with limited options over extensive-options scenarios. As the number of choices within the extensive-options scenarios increased, the preference for limited options increased as well.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D. D., DiGennaro Reed, F. D., Chok, J., &amp; Brozyna, G. A. (2011). The 'tyranny of choice': Choice overload as a possible instance of effort discounting. The Psychological Record, 61(4), 547-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain why choice can demotivate someone from a purchase have focuses on two factors. One assumes that perusing a larger number of choices imposes a cognitive burden on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood&lt;/ref&gt; The other assumes that individuals can experience [[regret (emotion)|regret]] if they make a suboptimal choice, and sometimes avoid making a choice to avoid experiencing regret.&lt;ref&gt;Irons and Hepburn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research has expanded on [[choice overload]], suggesting that there is a [[paradox of choice]]. As increasing options are available, three problems emerge. First, there is the issue of gaining adequate information about the choices in order to make a decision. Second, having more choices leads to an escalation of expectation. When there are increased options, people’s standards for what is an acceptable outcome rise; in other words, choice “spoils you.” Third, with many options available, people may come to believe they are to blame for an unacceptable result because with so many choices, they should have been able to pick the best one. If there is one choice available, and it ends up being disappointing, the world can be held accountable. When there are many options and the choice that one makes is disappointing, the individual is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2000). Self-determination: The tyranny of freedom. American Psychologist, 55(1), 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a recent meta-analysis of the literature on choice overload calls such studies into question (Scheibehenne, Greigeneder, and Todd, 2010). In many cases, researchers have found no effect of choice set size on people's beliefs, feelings, and behavior. Indeed, overall, the effect of "too many options" is minimal at best.

While it might be expected that it is preferable to keep one’s options open, research has shown that having the opportunity to revise one’s decisions leaves people less satisfied with the decision outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Daniel T., Ebert, Jane E. J. (2002). Decisions and revisions: The affective forecasting of changeable outcomes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 82(4). 503-14.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study found that participants experienced higher regret after having made a reversible decision. The results suggest that reversible decisions cause people to continue to think about the still relevant choice options, which might increase dissatisfaction with the decision and regret.&lt;ref&gt;Bullens, L., van Harreveld, F., &amp; Förster, J. (2011). Keeping one's options open: The detrimental consequences of decision reversibility. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 47(4), 800-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual personality plays a significant role in how individuals deal with large choice set sizes. Psychologists have developed a personality test that determines where an individual lies on the satisficer-maximizer spectrum. A maximizer is one who always seeks the very best option from a choice set, and may anguish after the choice is made as to whether it was indeed the best. Satisficers may set high standards but are content with a good choice, and place less priority on making the best choice. Due to this different approach to decision-making, maximizers are more likely to avoid making a choice when the choice set size is large, probably to avoid the anguish associated with not knowing whether their choice was optimal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; One study looked at whether the differences in choice satisfaction between the two are partially due to a difference in willingness to commit to one’s choices. It found that maximizers reported a stronger preference for retaining the ability to revise choices. Additionally, after making a choice to buy a poster, satisficers offered higher ratings of their chosen poster and lower ratings of the rejected alternatives. Maximizers, however, were less likely to change their impressions of the posters after making their choice which left them less satisfied with their decision.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, E. A., Ehrlinger, J., &amp; Eibach, R. P. (2012). Failing to commit: Maximizers avoid commitment in a way that contributes to reduced satisfaction. Personality And Individual Differences, 52(1), 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximizers are less happy in life, perhaps due to their obsession with making optimal choices in a society where people are frequently confronted with choice.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that maximizers reported significantly less [[life satisfaction]], happiness, optimism, and self-esteem, and significantly more regret and depression, than did satisficers. In regards to buying products, maximizers were less satisfied with consumer decisions and were more regretful. They were also more likely to engage in social comparison, where they analyze their relative social standing among their peers, and to be more affected by social comparisons in which others appeared to be in higher standing than them. For example, maximizers who saw their peer solve puzzles faster than themselves expressed greater doubt about their own abilities and showed a larger increase in negative mood.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B., Ward, A., Monterosso, J., Lyubomirsky, S., White, K., &amp; Lehman, D. R. (2002). Maximizing versus satisficing: Happiness is a matter of choice. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(5) 1178-97.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, people who refrain from taking better choices through drugs or other forms of escapism tend to be much happier in life.

Others{{Who|date=May 2013}} say that there is never too much choice and that there is a difference between happiness and satisfaction: a person who tries to find better decisions will often be dissatisfied, but not necessarily unhappy since his attempts at finding better choices did improve his lifestyle (even if it wasn't the ''best decision'' he will continually try to ''incrementally improve'' the decisions he takes).

[[Choice architecture]] is the process of encouraging people to make good choices through grouping and ordering the decisions in a way that maximizes successful choices and minimizes the number of people who become so overwhelmed by complexity that they abandon the attempt to choose.  Generally, success is improved by presenting the smaller or simpler choices first, and by choosing and promoting sensible default options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sheena Iyengar |title=The Art of Choosing |publisher=Twelve |location= |year=2010 |pages=208–213 |isbn=0-446-50410-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to identity==
[[File:Headresser.jpg|thumb|Choosing a hairstyle.]]
Certain choices, as personal preferences, can be central to expressing one's concept of [[self-identity]] or values.  In general, the more utilitarian an item, the less the choice says about a person's self-concept.  Purely functional items, such as a [[fire extinguisher]], may be chosen solely for function alone, but non-functional items, such as music, clothing fashions, or home decorations, may instead be chosen to express a person's concept of self-identity or associated values.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7534">'''Dataism''' is a term that has been used to describe the mindset or philosophy created by the emerging significance of [[Big data|Big Data]]. It was first used by [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More recently, the term has been expanded to describe what social scientist [[Yuval Noah Harari]] has called an emerging ideology or even a new form of religion, in which 'information flow' is the 'supreme value'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
"If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I'd say it is Data-ism", wrote [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the New York Times in February 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Philosophy of Data|last=Brooks|first=David|date=2013-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks argued that in a world of increasing complexity, relying on data can reduce cognitive biases and "illuminate patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed".

In 2015, Steve Lohr's book 'Data-ism' looked at how Big Data is transforming society, using the term to describe the Big Data revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-can-run-from-big-data-but-can-you-hide/2015/03/20/082ea46c-c805-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html|title=You can run from Big Data, but can you hide?|last=Igo|first=Sarah E.|date=2015-03-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861210012|title=Data-ism : The Revolution Transforming Decision Making, Consumer Behavior, and Almost Everything Else|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=May 2015|isbn=0062226819|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=861210012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development by Harari ===
In his 2016 book, [[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|Homo Deus]], [[Yuval Noah Harari]] takes the idea of Dataism further, putting it into a historical context. He argues that all competing political or social structures can be seen as data processing systems: "Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Hilbert_InfoGrowth.png|thumb|Harari expands on the term: A Dataist is someone that trusts Big Data (above) and computer algorithms, in preference to human knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953597984|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2017|publisher=Vintage|year=|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=429|oclc=953597984}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Harari posits that "we may interpret the entire human species as a single data processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage, Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then argues that the whole of human history can be read as a process of improving the efficiency of this system by increasing the number and variety of processors/chips (humans) in the system, increasing the number of connections between the processors and increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. A condensed form of this argument can be read in Harari's Wired article from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-dataism|title='Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm': Yuval Noah Harari on how data could eat the world|last=Harari|first=Yuval|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari goes on to argue that Dataism, like any other religion, has practical commandments. A Dataist should want to "maximise dataflow by connecting to more and more media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and believes that freedom of information is "the greatest good of all". Harari also argues that [[Aaron Swartz]], who took his life in 2013 after being prosecuted for releasing hundreds of thousands of scientific papers from the [[JSTOR]] archive online for free, could be called the "first martyr" of Dataism.

Writing in the Financial Times, Harari argued that Dataism presents an existential challenge to the dominant moral ideology of Humanism, which sees human feelings as the ultimate authority in the world: "humanism is now facing an existential challenge and the idea of “free will” is under threat... Once Big Data systems know me better than I know myself, authority will shift from humans to algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2016-08-26|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harari predicts that the logical conclusion of this process is that eventually humans will give algorithms the authority to make the most important decisions in their lives, such as who to marry and which career to pursue.

== Criticism ==
Commenting on Harari's characterisation of Dataism, security analyst Daniel Miessler believes that Dataism does not present the challenge to the ideology of liberal humanism that Harari claims, because humans will simultaneously be able to believe in their own importance and that of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-dataism/|title=Some Thoughts on Dataism|date=2017-04-07|work=Daniel Miessler|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari himself raises some criticisms, such as the problem of consciousness, which Dataism is unlikely to illuminate. Humans may also find out that organisms are not algorithms, he suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dataethics.eu/en/humanism-dataism-future-scenario/|title=From Humanism to Dataism. A future scenario. - Dataethical Thinkdotank|date=2017-04-25|work=Dataethical Thinkdotank|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other analysts such as Terry Ortleib have looked at the extent to which Dataism poses a dystopian threat to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Terry Ortlieb|title=is Harari Dataism Dystopian|date=2017-03-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev0Q4tCwgdI|accessdate=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death anxiety''' is [[anxiety]] caused by thoughts of [[death]]. One source defines death anxiety as a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to [[being|'be']]".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: {{cite journal|url= http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |title= How death anxiety impacts nurses' caring for patients at the end of life: a review of literature |vauthors= Peters L, Cant R, Payne S, O'Connor M, McDermott F, Hood K, Morphet J, Shimoinaba K |journal= Open Nurs J. |year= 2013 |volume= 7 |pages= 14–21 |doi= 10.2174/1874434601307010014 |pmid= 23400515 |pmc= 3565229 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172346/http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |archivedate= 2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also referred to as '''thanatophobia''' (fear of death), death anxiety is distinguished from [[necrophobia]], which is a specific fear of dead or dying people and/or things (i.e., fear of others who are dead or dying, not of one's own death or dying).&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Death anxiety can cause extreme timidness with a person's attitude towards discussing [[organ donation]] and anything to do with death.&lt;ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Robert Langs]] distinguishes three types of death anxiety:&lt;ref name=escp&gt;http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predatory death anxiety ===
Predatory death anxiety arises from the fear of being harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Langs, R. Three Forms of Death Anxiety. Retrieved from http://www.escp.org/death_anxiety.html; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most basic and oldest&lt;ref&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p615&lt;/ref&gt; form of death anxiety, with its origins in the first [[unicellular organism]]s’ set of adaptive resources. Unicellular organisms have receptors that have evolved to react to external dangers, along with self-protective, responsive mechanisms made to increase the likelihood of survival in the face of chemical and physical forms of attack or danger.&lt;ref&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p616&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, predatory death anxiety is evoked by a variety of danger situations that put one at risk or threaten one's survival.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"&gt;Castano.Leidner.Bonacossa.Nikkah.Perrulli.Spencer.Humphrey."Ideology, Fear of Death and Death Anxiety "Political Psychology.2011.p617&lt;/ref&gt; These traumas may be physical, psychological, or both.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"/&gt; Predatory death anxiety mobilizes an individual's adaptive resources and leads to a [[fight-or-flight response]]: active efforts to combat the danger or attempts to escape the threatening situation.&lt;ref name="Castano 2011. p617"/&gt;

=== Predation or predator death anxiety ===
Predation or predator death anxiety is a form that arises when an individual harms another, physically and/or mentally. This form of death anxiety is often accompanied by unconscious guilt.&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; This guilt, in turn, motivates and encourages a variety of self-made decisions and actions by the perpetrator of harm to others.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald.Hilgendorf. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3950021 Death imagery and death anxiety.] Journal of Clinical Psychology. 1996. p88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential death anxiety ===
Existential death anxiety stems from the basic knowledge that human life must end. Existential death anxiety is known to be the most powerful form.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p10&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that language has created the basis for existential death anxiety through communicative and behavioral changes.&lt;ref name="langs"/&gt; Other factors include an awareness of the distinction between self and others, a full sense of personal identity, and the ability to anticipate the future.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"&gt;Sterling. "Identity and Death Anxiety"Central Michigan University.1985.p11&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Awareness of human mortality arose some 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p13&lt;/ref&gt; In that extremely short span of evolutionary time, humans have fashioned a single basic mechanism through which they deal with the existential death anxieties this awareness has evoked—denial.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p13"/&gt; Denial is effected through a wide range of mental mechanisms and physical actions, many of which go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; While denial can be adaptive in limited use, excessive use is more common and is emotionally costly.&lt;ref name="Sterling. 1985. p11"/&gt; Denial is the root of such diverse actions as breaking rules, violating frames and boundaries, manic celebrations, directing violence against others, attempting to gain extraordinary wealth and power—and more.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"&gt;Simin."War, death anxiety, death depression and religion" California School of Professional Psychology.1996.p14&lt;/ref&gt; These pursuits are often activated by a death-related trauma, and while they may lead to constructive actions, more often than not, they lead to actions that are damaging to self and others.&lt;ref name="Simin 1996. p14"/&gt;

== Theories==

===Thanatophobia===

[[Sigmund Freud]] hypothesized that people express a fear of death, called thanatophobia. He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald&gt;http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106|title=The Truth about Death and Dying|first1=Karen|last1=Meyers|first2=Robert N.|last2=Golden|first3=Fred|last3=Peterson|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781438125817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as [[Thanatos]].

===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair===

Developmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as "[[ego integrity]]". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Terror management theory===
{{main|Terror management theory}}
[[Ernest Becker]] based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life—Fears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal97tm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As an individual develops [[mortality salience]], i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.&lt;ref&gt;Castano, Emanuele. (2011). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2011.00822.x/abstract Ideology, Fear of Death, and Death Anxiety] 603.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and adjustment hypotheses===
{{main|Death and adjustment hypotheses}}
[[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] postulated the [[Death and adjustment hypotheses]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} With the declaration of the hypotheses, two things were postulated. The first part of the hypotheses theorizes that death should not be considered the end of existence. The next segment states the belief that the immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.&lt;ref name=escp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ald/&gt;&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

===Being, time and Dasein===

[[Martin Heidegger]], the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as “clearing”. Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as “stop denying being-for-death”).&lt;ref name=concepts&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. Illness, Crisis and Loss, Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning management theory===

[[Paul T. P. Wong]]'s work on the meaning management theory&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P. (2008). Meaning-management theory and death acceptance. In A. Tomer, G. T. Eliason, &amp; P. T. P. Wong (Eds.), ''Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes'' (pp. 65-87). New York, NY: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that human reactions to death are complex, multifaceted and dynamic.&lt;ref name=concepts/&gt; His “Death Attitude Profile” identifies three types of death acceptances as Neutral, Approach, and Escape acceptances.&lt;ref&gt;Gesser, G., Wong, P. T. P., &amp; Reker, G. T. (1987-88). Death attitudes across the life span. The development and validation of the Death Attitude Profile (DAP). ''Omega, 2'', 113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P. T. P., Reker, G. T., &amp; Gesser, G. (1994). Death Attitude Profile – Revised: A multidimensional measure of attitudes toward death (DAP-R). In R. A. Neimeyer (Ed.), ''Death anxiety handbook: Research, instrumentation, and application'' (pp. 121-148). Washington, DC: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from acceptances, his work also represents different aspects of the meaning of death fear that are rooted in the bases of death anxiety. The ten meanings he proposes are finality, uncertainty, annihilation, ultimate loss, life flow disruption, leaving the loved ones, pain and loneliness, prematurity and violence of death, failure of life work completion, judgment and retribution centered.

===Other theories===

Other theories on death anxiety were introduced in the late part of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p570"&gt;Langs." Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety" The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p570&lt;/ref&gt; The existential approach, with theorists such as [[Rollo May]] and [[Viktor Frankl]], views an individual's personality as being governed by the continuous choices and decisions in relation to the realities of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. "Psychology" 2011. Chapter 12, page 488.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is the ''regret theory'' which was introduced by Adrian Tomer and Grafton Eliason.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"&gt;Langs. [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/prev.90.4.565.23914?journalCode=prev Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety.] The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p575&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the theory is to target the way people evaluate the quality and/or worth of their lives.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt; The possibility of death usually makes people more anxious if they feel that they have not and cannot accomplish any positive task in the life that they are living.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;  Research has tried to unveil the factors that might influence the amount of anxiety people experience in life.&lt;ref name="Langs 2003. p575"/&gt;

===Personal meanings of death===
{{See also|Meaning-making}}
Humans develop meanings and associate them with objects and events in their environment, provoking certain emotions within an individual. People tend to develop personal meanings of death which could accordingly be negative or positive for the individual. If they are positive, then the consequences of those meanings can be comforting (for example, ideas of a rippling effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yalom |first=Irvin D. |authorlink=Irvin D. Yalom |date=2008 |chapter=Rippling |title=Staring at the sun: overcoming the terror of death |location=San Francisco |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |isbn=9780787996680 |oclc=155715164 |pages=83–92 |quote=Each of us creates—often without our conscious intent or knowledge—concentric circles of influence that may affect others for years, even generations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; left on those still alive). If negative they can cause emotional turmoil. Depending on the certain meaning one has associated with death, the consequences will vary accordingly whether they are negative or positive meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cicirelli |first=Victor G. |date=November 1998 |title=Personal meanings of death in relation to fear of death |journal=[[Death Studies]] |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=713–733 |doi=10.1080/074811898201236 |pmid=10346699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religiosity's effect===

The thought of death causes a different degree of anxiety for different individuals, depending on many factors.

A 2012 study involving Christian and Muslim college students from the US, Turkey, and Malaysia found that their religiosity was positively correlated with an increased fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = L. | last2 = Wahab | first2 = E. A. | last3 = Ratnasingan | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1080/13674676.2011.652606 | title = Religiosity and fear of death: A three‐nation comparison | journal = Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 179 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found a strong sense of religion in a person's life can be related to a lower sense of anxiety towards death.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Wen, Y. (2010). Religiosity and death anxiety. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning, 6(2), 31-37. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/867401301&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been no association discovered between religiosity and death anxiety,&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; it has also been shown that death anxiety tends to be lower in individuals who regularly attend religious meetings or gatherings.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; On a recent study, one hundred and sixty-five church participants have been asked to fill out the "Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale, the Revised Death Anxiety Scale" and the results were analyzed using factor analyses, Pearson correlation, and linear and quadratic regression. All found an inverse relationship between intrinsic religious motivation and death anxiety. In short, the more religious you are, the less anxious you are about death because you may associate death with another beginning that is promised through many religions.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; The study also found that gender did not have an effect on religiosity and total death anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, Ya-Hui. The Journal of Human Resource and Adult Learning6. 2 (Dec 2010): 31-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

The earliest documentation of the fear of death has been found in children as young as age 5.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. The Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 12 (4), 525-535. Retrieved from http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/13591045/v12i0004/525_duafodiyc&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological measures and reaction times were used to measure fear of death in young children. Recent studies that assess fear of death in children use questionnaire rating scales.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt; There are many tests to study this including The Death Anxiety Scale for Children (DASC) developed by Schell and Seefeldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slaughter|first=Virginia|author2=Griffiths|title=Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=October 2007|volume=12 | issue = 4|pages=525–535|doi=10.1177/1359104507080980|pmid=18095535}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the most common version of this test is the revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC-R).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The FSSC-R describes specific fearful stimuli and children are asked to rate the degree to which the scenario/item makes them anxious or fearful.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The most recent version of the FSSC-R presents the scenarios in a pictorial form to children as young as 4. It is called the Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ).&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  The fear studies show that children's fears can be grouped into five categories. One of these categories is death and danger.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  This response was found amongst children age 4 to 6 on the KFQ, and from age 7 to 10.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;  Death is the most commonly feared item and remains the most commonly feared item throughout adolescence.&lt;ref name=maya/&gt;

A study of 90 children, aged 4–8, done by Virginia Slaughter and Maya Griffiths showed that a more mature understanding of the biological concept of death was correlated to a decreased fear of death. This may suggest that it is helpful to teach children about death (in a biological sense), in order to alleviate the fear.&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter, V., Griffiths, M. (2007). Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children. Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry. 12 (4) pg 525-535&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship between adult attachment and death anxiety ==
There has been much literature that supports the existence of a correlation between one's state of coping skills, mental health, emotions and cognitive reactions to stressful events, and one's ability to regulate affect concerning one's death anxiety. A series of tests determined that significantly high levels of death anxiety tend to occur in close relationships with an intimate partner (more so amongst females than males).&lt;ref&gt;Beggs, J. R.The relationship between adult attachment style and death anxiety as related to a romantic partner. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 5231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexes ==
The connection between death anxiety and one's sex appears to be strong.  Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males.  Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60.  The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men.  Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on death anxiety scales than men.&lt;ref name="Harrawood, L. K. 2008"&gt;Harrawood, L. K., White, L. J., &amp; Benshoff, J. J. (2008). Death Anxiety in a National Sample of United States Funeral Directors and Its Relationship with Death Exposure, Age, and Sex. Omega: Journal of Death &amp; Dying, 58(2), 129-146. {{DOI|10.2190/OM.58.2.c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the evolutionary period, a basic method was created to deal with death anxiety and also as a means of dealing with loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew.Dawson."Death anexiety:State or Trait" Journal od Clinical Psychology.1979.pg158&lt;/ref&gt; Denial is used when memories or feelings are too painful to accept and are often rejected.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"&gt;Donald.Charles. "Death Anxiety and Mental Ability" Essence: Issues in the Study of Ageing, Dying and Death. 1979.p85&lt;/ref&gt; By maintaining that the event never happened, rather than accepting it, allows an individual more time to work through the inevitable pain.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; When a loved one dies in a family, denial is often implemented as a means to come to grips with the reality that the person is gone.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Closer families often deal with death better than when coping individually.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; As society and families drift apart so does the time spent bereaving those who have died, which in turn leads to negative emotion and negativity towards death.&lt;ref name="Donald 1979. p85"/&gt; Women, who are the child bearers and are often the ones who look after children hold greater concerns about death due to their caring role within the family.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"&gt;Langs. "Death Anxiety and the Emotion-processing Mind" Psychoanalytic Psychology .2004.p43&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this common role of women that leads to greater death anxiety as it emphasize the ‘importance to live’ for her offspring.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt; Although it is common knowledge that all living creatures die, many people do not accept their own mortality, preferring not to accept that death is inevitable, and that they will one day die.&lt;ref name="Langs. 2004. p43"/&gt;

==Age ==
It is during the years of young adulthood (20 to 40 years of age) that death anxiety most often begins to become prevalent.  However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40–64 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan.  Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older).  This is in contrast with most people's expectations, especially regarding all of the negative connotations younger adults have about the elderly and the aging process (Kurlychek &amp; Trenner, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trenner|title=Accuracy of perception and attitude: An intergenerational investigation|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skill|year=1982|volume=54|issue=1|pages=271–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring death anxiety ==

There are many ways to measure death anxiety and fear.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"&gt;Tomer.Eliason."Toward a comprehensive model of death anxiety" Death Stuides.1996.p353&lt;/ref&gt; Katenbaum and Aeinsberg (1972) devised three propositions for this measurement.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; From this start, the ideologies about death anxiety have been able to be recorded and their attributes listed.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; Methods such as imagery tasks to simple questionnaires and apperception tests such as the [[Stroop effect#Stroop test|Stroop test]] enable psychologists to adequately determine if a person is under stress due to death anxiety or suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;
The Lester attitude death scale was developed in 1966 but not published until 1991 until its validity was proven.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt; By measuring the general attitude towards death and also the inconsistencies with death attitudes, participants are scaled to their favorable value towards death.&lt;ref name="Tomer 1996. p353"/&gt;

In classical [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalytic theory]], the '''death drive''' ({{lang-de|Todestrieb}}) is the [[Drive theory|drive]] toward death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by [[Sabina Spielrein]] in her paper "Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |date=April 1994 |title=Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=155–186 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-5922.1994.00155.x}} [http://www.arizonapsychoanalyticsociety.com/downloads/sabrina.pdf Free pdf of the full essay] by the Arizona Psychoanalytic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1995 |title=Destruction as Cause of Becoming |journal=Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Thought |volume=18 |issue= |pages=85–118|doi= |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=pct.018.0085a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'')&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1912 |title=''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'' |journal=Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische Forschungen |volume=IV |issue= |pages=465–503 |doi= |url=https://archive.org/stream/JahrbuchFuumlrPsychoanalytischeUndPsychopathologischeForschungenIv_509/JdP_IV_1912_1_Haelfte#page/n467/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912, which was then taken up by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1920 in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]].'' This concept has been translated as "opposition between the ego or death [[instinct]]s and the sexual or life instincts".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle" in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pleasure Principle'', Freud used the plural "death drives" (''Todestriebe'') much more frequently than in the singular.&lt;ref&gt;See occurrences of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drives%22 "death drives"] and of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drive%22 "death drive"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The death drive opposes [[Eros (concept)#Sigmund Freud|Eros]], the tendency toward survival, propagation, sex, and other creative, life-producing drives. The death drive is sometimes referred to as "[[Thanatos]]" in post-Freudian thought, complementing "Eros", although this term was not used in Freud's own work, being rather introduced by [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in 1909 and then by [[Paul Federn]] in the present context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Jones |title=The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud.

The Standard Edition of Freud's works in English confuses two terms that are different in German, ''Instinkt'' ("instinct") and ''Trieb'' ("drive"), often translating both as ''instinct''; for example, "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id", in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; "This equating of ''instinkt'' and ''Trieb'' has created serious misunderstandings".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'', (London, 1946), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988) [1973]. "[https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=%22Instinct+(or+Drive)+=+I.+D.:+Instinkt%22%22D.:+Trieb%22 Instinct (or Drive) (pp. 214-7).]"&lt;/ref&gt; Freud actually refers to the term "instinkt" in explicit use elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Instinct and Drive (pp. 19ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Instinct+and+Drive%22 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Instincts |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=qnowAAAAIAAJ 1970] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-317-67045-2 |id={{ISBN|1-31767045-0}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so while the concept of "instinct" can loosely be referred to as a "drive," any essentialist or naturalist connotations of the term should be put in abeyance. In a sense, the death drive is a force that is not essential to the life of an organism (unlike an "instinct") and tends to denature it or make it behave in ways that are sometimes counter-intuitive. In other words, the term death "drive" is simply a false representation of death instinct. The term is almost universally known in scholarly literature on Freud as the "death drive", and Lacanian psychoanalysts often shorten it to simply "drive" (although Freud posited the existence of other drives as well, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] explicitly states in Seminar XI that all drives are partial to the death drive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The four fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis|last=|first=|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=|isbn=9780393317756|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Penguin translations of Freud translate ''Trieb'' and ''Instinkt'' as "drive" and "instinct" respectively.

==Origin of the theory: ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''==
{{Main|Beyond the Pleasure Principle}}
{{Anchors|origin}}It was a basic premise of Freud's that "the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle...[associated] with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle", p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of conflictual evidence, difficult to explain satisfactorily in such terms, led Freud late in his career to look for another principle in mental life ''beyond'' the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]—a search that would ultimately lead him to the concept of the death drive.

The first problem Freud encountered was the phenomenon of repetition in (war) trauma. When Freud worked with people with [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] (particularly the trauma experienced by soldiers returning from [[World War I]]), he observed that subjects often tended to repeat or re-enact these traumatic experiences: "dreams occurring in traumatic have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the expectations of the pleasure principle.

A second problematic area was found by Freud in children's [[Play (activity)|play]] (such as the ''Fort/Da'' [Forth/here] game played by Freud's grandson, who would stage and re-stage the disappearance of his mother and even himself). "How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third problem came from clinical practice.  Freud found his patients, dealing with painful experiences that had been repressed, regularly "obliged to ''repeat'' the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of [...] ''remembering'' it as something belonging to the past".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with what he called "the compulsion of destiny [...] come across [in] people all of whose human relationships have the same outcome",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 294 and p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; such evidence led Freud "to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that would seem more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then set out to find an explanation of such a compulsion; in Freud's own words, "What follows is speculation, often far-fetched speculation, which the reader will consider or dismiss according to his individual predilection".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a new instinctual paradigm for such problematic repetition, he found it ultimately in "''an urge in organic life to restore an earlier state of things''"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;—the inorganic state from which life originally emerged. From the conservative, restorative character of instinctual life, Freud derived his death drive, with its "pressure towards death", and the resulting "separation of the death instincts from the life instincts"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", pp. 316 and 322.&lt;/ref&gt; seen in Eros. The death drive then manifested itself in the individual creature as a force "whose function is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking further potential clinical support for the existence of such a self-destructive force, Freud found it through a reconsideration of his views of masochism—previously "regarded as sadism that has been turned round upon the subject's own ego"—so as to allow that "there ''might'' be such a thing as primary masochism—a possibility which I had contested"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; before. Even with such support, however, he remained very tentative to the book's close about the provisional nature of his theoretical construct: what he called "the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spielrein's paper was published in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''. In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923) he would develop his argument to state that "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Ego/Id", p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he would spell out more clearly that the "libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct to a great extent outwards [...]. The instinct is then called the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "The Economic Problem of Masochism" in ''On Metapsychology'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.

At the close of the decade, in ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), Freud acknowledged that "To begin with it was only tentatively that I put forward the views I have developed here, but in the course of time they have gained such a hold upon me that I can no longer think in any other way".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Civilization and Its Discontents", in ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the "Will"{{!}}Philosophy of the "Will" in Schopenhauer}}
From a philosophical perspective, the death drive may be viewed in relation to the work of the German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. His philosophy, expounded in ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1818) postulates that all exists by a metaphysical "will" (more clearly, a '''will to live'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=The World as Will and Presentation |others=Translated by Richard E. Aquila and David Carus |location= New York |publisher= Longman |year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and that pleasure affirms this will. Schopenhauer's [[pessimism]] led him to believe that the affirmation of the "will" was a negative and immoral thing, due to his belief of life producing more suffering than happiness. The death drive would seem to manifest as a natural and psychological negation of the "will".

Freud was well aware of such possible linkages. In a letter of 1919, he wrote that regarding "the theme of death, [that I] have stumbled onto an odd idea via the drives and must now read all sorts of things that belong to it, for instance Schopenhauer".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Gay, ''Freud: A life for our time'' (London, 1989), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[Ernest Jones]] (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that "Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (London, 1964), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as Freud put it to the imagined auditors of his ''New Introductory Lectures'' (1932), "You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: "That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!" But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (London, 1991), pp. 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to add that "what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer....we are not overlooking the fact that there is life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural application: ''Civilization and Its Discontents''==
{{Main|Civilization and Its Discontents}}
Freud applied his new theoretical construct in ''Civilization and Its Discontents'' (1930) to the difficulties inherent in [[western culture|Western civilization]]—indeed, in civilization and in social life as a whole. In particular, given that "a portion of the [death] instinct is diverted towards the external world and comes to light as an instinct of aggressiveness', he saw 'the inclination to aggression [...] [as] the greatest impediment to civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' pp. 310 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to overcome such aggression entailed the formation of the [cultural] superego: "We have even been guilty of the heresy of attributing the origin of conscience to this diversion inwards of aggressiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Why War?" in ''Civilization'', p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence thereafter in the individual of the superego and a related sense of guilt—"Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by [...] setting up an agency within him to watch over it"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;—leaves an abiding sense of uneasiness inherent in civilized life, thereby providing a structural explanation for 'the suffering of civilized man'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London, 1997), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud made a further connection between [[Group (sociology)|group]] life and innate aggression, where the former comes together more closely by directing aggression to other groups, an idea later picked up by group analysts like [[Wilfred Bion]].

==Continuing development of Freud's views==
In the closing decade of Freud's life, it has been suggested, his view of the death drive changed somewhat, with "the stress much more upon the death instinct's manifestations ''outwards''".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Dickson, "Editor's Introduction", ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given "the ubiquity of non-erotic aggressivity and destructiveness", he wrote in 1930, "I adopt the standpoint, therefore, that the inclination to aggression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in man".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', pp. 311 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 he conceded of his original formulation of the death drive 'the improbability of our speculations.  A queer instinct, indeed, directed to the destruction of its own organic home!'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote moreover that "Our hypothesis is that there are two essentially different classes of instincts: the sexual instincts, understood in the widest sense—Eros, if you prefer that name—and the aggressive instincts, whose aim is destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he went so far as to suggest privately that 'We should have a neat schematic picture if we supposed that originally, at the beginning of life, all libido was directed to the inside and all aggressiveness to the outside'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud quoted by Dickson, ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his last writings, it was the contrast of "two basic instincts, ''Eros'' and ''the destructive instinct'' [...] our two primal instincts, ''Eros'' and ''destructiveness'',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition'' vol. xxiii (London 1964), pp. 148 and 246.&lt;/ref&gt; on which he laid stress.  Nevertheless, his belief in "the death instinct [...] [as] a return to an earlier state [...] into an inorganic state"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''SE'', xxiii, pp. 148-9.&lt;/ref&gt; continued to the end.

==Analytic reception==
As Freud wryly commented in 1930, "The assumption of the existence of an instinct of death or destruction has met with resistance even in analytic circles".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Ernest Jones would comment of ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' that the book not only "displayed a boldness of speculation that was unique in all his writings" but was "further noteworthy in being the only one of Freud's which has received little acceptance on the part of his followers".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Life'', p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Fenichel in his compendious survey of the first Freudian half-century concluded that "the facts on which Freud based his concept of a death instinct in no way necessitate the assumption [...] of a genuine self-destructive instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London, 1946), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinz Hartmann]] set the tone for [[ego psychology]] when he "chose to [...] do without 'Freud's other, mainly biologically oriented set of hypotheses of the "life" and "death instincts"'".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, ''Freud'', pp. 402-3n.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[object relations theory]], among the independent group 'the most common repudiation was the loathsome notion of the death instinct'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi, ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge, 2006), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, "for most analysts Freud's idea of a primitive urge towards death, of a primary masochism, was [...] bedevilled by problems".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, ''Freud'', p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the concept has been defended, extended, and carried forward by some analysts, generally those tangential to the psychoanalytic mainstream; while among the more orthodox, arguably of "those who, in contrast to most other analysts, take Freud's doctrine of the death drive seriously, K. R. Eissler has been the most persuasive—or least unpersuasive".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 768.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Klein]] and her immediate followers considered that "the infant is exposed from birth to the anxiety stirred up by the inborn polarity of instincts—the immediate conflict between the life instinct and the death instinct";&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;[[Hanna Segal]], ''Introduction to the work of Melanie Klein'' (London, 1964), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kleinians indeed built much of their theory of early childhood around the outward deflection of the latter. "This deflection of the death instinct, described by Freud, in Melanie Klein's view consists partly of a projection, partly of the conversion of the death instinct into aggression".&lt;ref name=Segal /&gt;

French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], for his part, castigated the "refusal to accept this culminating point of Freud's doctrine [...] by those who conduct their analysis on the basis of a conception of the ''ego'' [...] that death instinct whose enigma Freud propounded for us at the height of his experience".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, he stressed the linguistic aspects of the death drive: "the symbol is substituted for death in order to take possession of the first swelling of life [...]. There is therefore no further need to have recourse to the outworn notion of primordial masochism in order to understand the reason for the repetitive games in [...] his ''Fort!'' and in his ''Da!''."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' pp. 124 and 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] too would proudly proclaim that he, "besides having repeated and confirmed the conventional observations of Freud, also believes right down the line with him concerning the death instinct, and the pervasiveness of the [[repetition compulsion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You say After You Say Hello?'' (London, 1975) pp. 399-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the twenty-first century, "the death drive today [...] remains a highly controversial theory for many psychoanalysts [...] [almost] as many opinions as there are psychoanalysts".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London, 2005), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's conceptual opposition of death and eros drives in the human psyche was applied by Walter A. Davis in ''Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative''&lt;ref name=Adams01&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Deracination; Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative|date=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-79144834-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Death's Dream Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9/11.''&lt;ref name=Adam02&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Death's Dream Kingdom|date=2006|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-74532468-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis described social reactions to both Hiroshima and 9/11 from the Freudian viewpoint of the death force. Unless they consciously take responsibility for the damage of those reactions, Davis claims that Americans will repeat them.

According to contemporary theories of consciousness, the brain is the basis of [[subjectivity|subjective experience]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[self-awareness]], and [[awareness]] of the surrounding [[nature|natural world]]. When [[brain death]] occurs, all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases. Many people who believe that death is a permanent cessation of consciousness also believe that consciousness is dependent upon the functioning of the brain. Scientific research has discovered that some areas of the brain, like the [[reticular activating system]] or the [[thalamus]], appear to be [[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] for consciousness, because [[disorders of consciousness|damage to these structures]] or their lack of function causes a loss of consciousness.

Through a naturalist analysis of the [[mind]] (an approach adopted by many philosophers of mind and neuroscientists), it is regarded as being dependent on the brain, as shown from the various effects of brain damage.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience and the soul"&gt;{{cite web

== Etymology ==
The English word "oblivion" (late 14c.) comes from the [[Old French]] ''oblivion'' (13c.) and directly from the [[Latin]] ''oblivionem'', meaning "forgetfulness; a being forgotten", which also comes from the word ''oblivisci'' ("to forget").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=oblivion|title=oblivion - Origin and meaning of oblivion by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:wikt:oblivion|Oblivion]] itself means "state of being forgotten".

==Oblivion and subjectivity==
Thomas W. Clark, founder of Center for Naturalism, wrote a paper titled "Death, Nothingness, and Subjectivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalism.org/death.htm |title=death |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208055953/http://www.naturalism.org/death.htm |website=www.naturalism.org |archivedate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He critiqued what he saw as a flawed description of eternal oblivion as a "plunge into darkness". When some imagine their deaths (including the non-religious), they project themselves into a future [[self]] which experiences an eternal silent darkness. This is wrong, because without consciousness, there is no awareness of [[space]] and no basis for [[time]]. For Clark, in oblivion there isn't even an absence of experience, as we can only speak of experience when a subjective self exists.

According to [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] [[Giulio Tononi]], consciousness is "all we are and all we have: lose consciousness and, as far as you are concerned, your own self and the entire world dissolve into nothingness."&lt;ref name="pmid19098144"&gt;{{cite journal

: "Many kinds of evidence show that the mind is an entity in the physical world, part of a causal chain of physical events. If you send an electric current through the brain, you cause the person to have a vivid experience. If a part of the brain dies because of a blood clot or a burst artery or a bullet wound, a part of the person is gone — the person may lose an ability to see, think, or feel in a certain way, and the entire personality may change. The same thing happens gradually when the brain accumulates a protein called beta-amyloid in the tragic disease known as [[Alzheimer's]]. The person — the soul, if you want — gradually disappears as the brain decays from this physical process. We know that every form of mental activity — every emotion, every thought, every percept — gives off electrical, magnetic, or metabolic signals that can be recorded with increasing precision by [[positron emission tomography]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], [[magnetoencephalography]], and other techniques. We know that if you look at the brain under a microscope, it has a breathtaking degree of complexity — on the order of a trillion synapses — that's fully commensurate with the breathtaking complexity of human thought and experience. We know that when the brain dies, the person goes out of existence."

==Physics and death==
In his book ''The Big Picture'', physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] asserts that through physics we can demonstrate that death is equivalent to eternal oblivion. He writes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean M. |title=The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself |year=2016 |publisher=Penguin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x21qCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218 |isbn=9780698409767 |p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "There is a much more profound implication of accepting the Core Theory as underlying the world of our everyday experience. Namely: there is no life after death. We each have a finite time as living creatures, and when it's over, it's over. The reasoning behind such a sweeping claim is even more straightforward than the argument against [[telekinesis]] or [[astrology]]. If the particles and forces of the Core Theory are what constitute each living being, without any immaterial soul, then the information that makes up "you" is contained in the arrangement of atoms that makes up your body, including your brain. There is no place for that information to go, or any way for it to be preserved, outside your body. There are no particles or fields that could store it and take it away."

== In philosophy ==
{{primary sources|section|date=August 2017}}
In the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (written by [[Plato]]), after [[Socrates]] is sentenced to death, he addresses the court. He ponders the nature of death, and summarizes that there are basically two opinions about it. The first is that it is a [[Metempsychosis|migration of the soul]] or [[consciousness]] from this existence into another, and that the souls of all previously deceased people will also be there. This excites Socrates, because he will be able to conduct his [[Socratic method|dialectic inquiries]] with all of the great [[Greek hero cult|Greek heroes]] and thinkers of the past. The other opinion about death is that it is oblivion, the complete cessation of consciousness, not only unable to feel but a complete lack of awareness, like a person in a deep, dreamless sleep. Socrates says that even this oblivion does not frighten him very much, because while he would be unaware, he would correspondingly be free from any pain or suffering. Indeed, Socrates says, not even the great King of Persia could say that he ever rested so soundly and peacefully as he did in a dreamless sleep.

[[Cicero]], writing three centuries later in his treatise ''[[Cato Maior de Senectute|On Old Age]]'', in the voice of [[Cato the Elder]], similarly discussed the prospects of death, frequently referring to the works of earlier Greek writers. Cicero also concluded that death was either a continuation of consciousness or cessation of it, and that if consciousness continues in some form, there is no reason to fear death; while if it is in fact eternal oblivion, he will be free of all worldly miseries, in which case he should also not be deeply troubled by death.

Similar thoughts about death were expressed by the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Lucretius]] in his first-century BC [[Didacticism|didactic]] poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' and by the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Epicurus]] in his ''Letter to Menoeceus'', in which he writes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html|title=Epicurus - Letter to Menoeceus|first=Vincent|last=Cook|website=www.epicurus.net|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~phltso/deathfrags.html|title=Epicurus and Lucretius against the dear of death|website=www2.gsu.edu|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: "Accustom yourself to believing that death is nothing to us, for good and evil imply the capacity for sensation, and death is the privation of all sentience; therefore, a correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding to life a limitless time, but by taking away the yearning after immortality. For life has no terrors for him who has thoroughly understood that there are no terrors for him in ceasing to live. Foolish, therefore, is the man who says that he fears death, not because it will pain when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. Whatever causes no annoyance when it is present causes only a groundless pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer."

Paraphrasing philosopher [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], Keith Augustine and Yonatan I. Fishman note that "the greater the damage to the brain, the greater the corresponding damage to the mind. The natural extrapolation from this pattern is all too clear — obliterate brain functioning altogether, and mental functioning too will cease".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dlRuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206 books.google.com], Augustine &amp; Fishman, 2015, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gametangium''' (plural: gametangia) is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or [[cell (biology)|cell]] in which [[gamete]]s are produced that is found in many multicellular [[protist]]s, [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]], and the [[gametophyte]]s of [[plant]]s. In contrast to [[gametogenesis]] in [[animal]]s, a gametangium is a [[haploid]] structure and formation of gametes does not involve [[meiosis]].

==Types of gametangia==
Depending on the type of gamete produced in a gametangium, several types can be distinguished.

===Female===
{{Main|Archegonium|Oogonium}}
Female gametangia are most commonly called '''[[Archegonium|archegonia]]'''. They produce [[egg cell]]s and are the sites for [[fertilization]]. Archegonia are common in algae and primitive plants as well as [[gymnosperm]]s. In [[flowering plant]]s, they are replaced by the [[embryo sac]] inside the [[ovule]].

===Male===
{{Main|Antheridium}}
The male gametangia are most commonly called '''[[Antheridium|antheridia]]'''. They produce [[Sperm|sperm cells]] that they release for fertilization. Antheridia producing non-motile sperm (spermatia) are called '''spermatangia'''. Some antheridia do not release their sperm. For example, the [[oomycete]] antheridium is a [[syncytium]] with many sperm [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] and fertilization occurs via fertilization tubes growing from the antheridium and making contact with the egg cells. Antheridia are common in the gametophytes in "lower" plants such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, [[cycad]]s and [[ginkgo]]. In "higher" plants such as [[conifer]]s and flowering plants, they are replaced by [[pollen grain]]s.

===Isogamous===
In [[isogamy]], the gametes look alike and cannot be classified into "male" or "female." For example, in [[zygomycete]]s, two gametangia (single [[multinucleate]] cells at the end of [[hypha]]e) form good contact with each other and fuse into a zygosporangium. Inside the zygosporangium, the nuclei from each of the original two gametangia pair up.

{{essay-like|date=December 2017}}
'''Gerontology'''  is the study of the [[social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[Psychology|psychological]], [[cognitive]], and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[ageing]]. The word was coined by [[Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov]] in 1903, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:γέρων|γέρων]], ''geron'', "old man" and -λογία, ''-logia'', "study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aghe.org/resources/gerontology-geriatrics-descriptions|title=Gerontology/Geriatrics Definitions|last=Confluence|website=www.aghe.org|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is distinguished from [[geriatrics]], which is the branch of medicine that specializes in the treatment of existing disease in older adults. Gerontologists include researchers and practitioners in the fields of biology, nursing, medicine, criminology, dentistry, social work, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, economics, political science, architecture, geography, pharmacy, public health, housing, and anthropology.&lt;ref name=Hooyman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooyman |first1=N.R. |last2=Kiyak |first2=H.A. |title=Social gerontology: A multidisciplinary perspective |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston |year=2011 |isbn=978-0205763139 |edition=9th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidisciplinary nature of gerontology means that there are a number of sub-fields which overlap with gerontology. There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an [[Population ageing|ageing population]] on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer's disease. As an academic discipline the field is relatively new. The USC Leonard Davis School created the first PhD, master's and bachelor's degree programs in gerontology in 1975.

==History==
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], several physicians wrote on issues related to Gerontology. [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025) offered instruction for the care of the aged, including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and remedies for problems including [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=Howell87&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic physician [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]] Al-Qayrawani (Algizar, c. 898–980) wrote on the aches and conditions of the elderly (Ammar 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ammar |first1= S |year= 1998 |title= Vesalius |journal= Official Journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine |volume= 4 |page= 48 |url= http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/ishm/vesalius/VESx1998x04x01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly work covers [[sleep disorder]]s, [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]], how to strengthen [[memory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/bioI.html#jazzar |title=Ibn al-Jazzār, Abū Ja'far Ahmad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Abī Khālid (d. 979/369) |work=Islamic Medical Manuscripts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Geritt Bos, ''Ibn al-Jazzar'', ''Risala fi l-isyan'' (Treatise on forgetfulness), London, 1995 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and causes of [[Death|mortality]]&lt;ref name="Al Jazzar"&gt;[http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm Al Jazzar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706155736/http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ishaq ibn Hunayn]] (died 910) also wrote works on the treatments for forgetfulness (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_08.html |title=Specialized literature |work=Islamic culture and medical arts |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of aged humans, and the [[life expectancy]], tended to increase in every century since the 14th, society tended to consider caring for an elderly relative as a family issue. It was not until the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] that ideas shifted in favor of a societal care-system. Some early pioneers, such as [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], who himself lived to be 102, believed that aging itself should be a science to be studied. [[Élie Metchnikoff]] coined the term "gerontology" {{circa}} 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gerontology Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pioneers like [[James Birren]] began organizing gerontology as its own field in the 1940s, later being involved in starting a US government agency on aging &amp;ndash; the [[National Institute on Aging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Institute on Aging|url=https://www.nia.nih.gov/about|publisher=National Institute on Aging, US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; programs in gerontology at the [[University of Southern California]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and as past president of the [[Gerontological Society of America]] (founded in 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Beth|title=In memoriam: James E.

With the population of people over 60 years old expected to be some 22% of the world's population by 2050, assessment and treatment methods for age-related disease burden &amp;ndash; the term ''geroscience'' emerged in the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4036419|year=2014|author1=Burch|first1=J.

==Aging demographics==
The world is forecast to undergo rapid [[aging population|population aging]] in the next several decades.  In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States and across the world, the [[Baby boomers|"baby boomer"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web |author=Carrie A. Werner |title=The Older Population: 2010 |year=2010 |work=2010 Census Briefs |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-09.pdf |id=C2010BR-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been estimated that 25% of the population in the United States and [[Canada]] will be aged 65 years and older by 2025.  Moreover, by 2050, it is predicted that, for the first time in United States history, the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will be greater than the number of children aged 0 to 14 years.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;  Those aged 85 years and older (oldest-old) are projected to increase from 5.3 million to 21 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Population |chapterurl=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/2008_Documents/Population.aspx |title=2008 Older Americans : Key indicators of Well-Being |year=2008 |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/agingstatsdotnet/Main_Site/Data/Data_2008.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adults aged 85–89 years constituted the greatest segment of the oldest-old in 1990, 2000, and 2010.  However, the largest percentage point increase among the oldest-old occurred in the 90- to 94-year-old age group, which increased from 25.0% in 1990 to 26.4% in 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

With the rapid growth of the aging population, social work education and training specialized in older adults and practitioners interested in working with older adults are increasingly in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute for Geriatric Social Work |publisher=Boston University |url=http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711073154/http://www.bu.edu/igsw/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geriatric Social Work Initiative |url=http://www.gswi.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences with age ===

There has been a considerable disparity between the number of men and women in the older population in the United States.  In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

=== Geographic distribution of older adults ===
The number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;

== Biogerontology ==
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|The hand of an older adult]]
{{Main|Theories of aging}}
Biogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process. It involves interdisciplinary research on biological aging's causes, effects, and mechanisms.

[[Biomedical gerontology]], also known as experimental gerontology and [[life extension]], is a sub-discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both humans and animals. Most "[[Anti-aging movement|life extensionists]]" believe the human life span can be increased within the next century, if not sooner. Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try. Geroscience is a recently formulated interdisciplinary field that embraces biomedical gerontology as the center of preventing [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] through science.&lt;ref name="Lithgow2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lithgow|first1=Gordon J.|authorlink1=Gordon J. Lithgow|title=Origins of Geroscience|journal=Public Policy &amp; Aging Report|date=1 September 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=10–11|doi=10.1093/ppar/23.4.10|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with biogerontology, which aims to prevent age-related disease by intervening in aging processes, geriatrics is a field of medicine that studies the treatment of existing disease in aging people.

There are numerous theories of aging, and no one theory has been accepted. There is a wide spectrum of the types of theories for the causes of aging with programmed theories on one extreme and error theories on the other. Regardless of the theory, a commonality is that as humans age, functions of the body decline.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |first1=Albert W. |last1=Taylor |first2=Michel J. |last2=Johnson |title=Physiology of Exercise and Healthy Aging |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcGtzfxkFhwC |year=2008 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0-7360-5838-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stochastic theories ===
Stochastic theories of aging is the suggestion that aging is caused by small changes in the body over time and the body's failure to restore the system and mend the damages to the body. The cells and tissues are eventually injured due to the damage gathered over time. This causes the diminishes in an organ's function related to age. The notion of accumulated damage was first introduced by Weisman as the "wear and tear" theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lipsky|first1=Martin S.|last2=King|first2=Mitch|title=Biological theories of aging|journal=Disease-a-Month|date=2015|volume=61|issue=11|pages=460–466|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2015.09.005|pmid=26490576|url=http://www.diseaseamonth.com/article/S0011-5029(15)00146-7/abstract|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wear and tear theory====

Wear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of [[Insult (medical)|insults]] which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

==== Accumulation ====
Accumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt; An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.

==== Free radical theory ====
[[Free radicals]] are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage. The [[free-radical theory of aging]] proposes that this damage cumulatively degrades the biological function of cells and impacts the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boniewska-Bernacka|first=Ewa|date=2016|title=Selected Theories of Ageing|url=https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/11286/Boniewska.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Higher School's Pulse|volume=10|pages=36–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that free radicals are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenn|first=Rebecca|author2=Gilbert, DL, Nye, SW, Dwyer, P, and Fenn WO|title=Oxygen poisoning and x-irradiation: a mechanism in common|journal=Science|date=7 May 1954|volume=119|issue=3097|pages=623–626|pmid=13156638|bibcode=1954Sci...119..623G|doi=10.1126/science.119.3097.623 |last3=Nye|first3=Sylvanus W.|last4=Dwyer|first4=Peter|last5=Fenn|first5=Wallace O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but came to prominence in 1956, when [[Denham Harman]] proposed the free-radical theory of aging and even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harman|first=D|title=The aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=November 1981|volume=78|issue=11|pages=7124–7128|pmid=6947277 |pmc=349208|doi=10.1073/pnas.78.11.7124 |bibcode=1981PNAS...78.7124H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Bruce N|author2=MK Shigenaga |author3=TM Hagen |title=Oxidants, antioxidants, and the degenerative diseases of aging |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |date=September 1993 |volume=90 |issue=17|pages=7915–7922 |pmid=8367443|pmc=47258|bibcode=1993PNAS...90.7915A|doi=10.1073/pnas.90.17.7915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckman|first=KB|author2=Ames BN|title=The free radial theory of aging matures|journal=Physiol Rev|date=April 1998|volume=78|issue=2|pages=547–581|pmid=9562038 |doi=10.1152/physrev.1998.78.2.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.

==== DNA damage theory ====

DNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by [[Gioacchino Failla]] in 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Failla|first=G|title=The aging process and cancerogenesis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 1958|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1124–1140|pmid=13583876|bibcode=1958NYASA..71.1124F|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1958.tb46828.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist [[Leó Szilárd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szilard|first=Leo|title=On the nature of the aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=January 1959|volume=45|issue=1|pages=30–45|pmid=16590351|pmc=222509|doi=10.1073/pnas.45.1.30|bibcode=1959PNAS...45...30S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freitas|first=AA|author2=de Magalhaes, JP|title=A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing|journal=Mutat Res|date=Jul–Oct 2011|volume=728|issue=1–2|pages=12–22|pmid=21600302|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cross-linking theory====

The cross-linking theory proposes that [[advanced glycation end-product]]s (stable bonds formed by the binding of glucose to proteins) and other aberrant [[cross-links]] accumulating in aging tissues is the cause of aging. The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. [[Crosslinking of DNA]] can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Genetic ===
Genetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a "biological clock" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The [[Biological clock (aging)|epigenetic clock]], which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Horvath S |title=

=== General imbalance ===
General imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the [[Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.&lt;ref name= Taylor /&gt;

====Immunological theory====

The immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and [[Neoplasm|neoplastic cells]]. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Social gerontology ==
Social gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[demography]], [[public health]], or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.

Because issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.

=== Social theories of aging ===
Several theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson&gt;{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&amp;pg=PA68 |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Peace |editor2-first=S. M. |editor3-last=Dittmann-Kohli |editor3-first=F. |editor4-last=Westerhof |editor4-first=G. |title=Ageing in Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C |year=2007 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-4129-0020-1 |pages=68–84 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activity theory ====
[[Activity theory (aging)|Activity theory]] was developed and elaborated by Cavan, Havighurst, and Albrecht. According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Activity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, [[post-industrial society]], which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.&lt;ref name="allnurses-breakroom.com"&gt;VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disengagement theory ====
[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose "ego-energy" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Gradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.

==== Continuity theory ====
[[Continuity theory]] is an elusive concept. On one hand,
to exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to
be uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.
This static view of continuity is not very applicable
to human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic
view of continuity starts with the idea of a basic
structure which persists over time, but it allows for a
variety of changes to occur within the context provided
by the basic structure. The basic structure is
coherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts
that is recognizably unique and that allows us to
differentiate that structure from others. With the
introduction of the concept of time, ideas such as
direction, sequence, character development, and
story line enter into the concept of continuity as it is
applied to the evolution of a human being. In this
theory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed
and applied to the issue of adaptation to normal
aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=978-0803918047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central premise of continuity theory is that, in
making adaptive choices, middle-aged and older
adults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal
and external structures and that they prefer to
accomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,
applying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).
In middle and later life, adults are drawn by the
weight of past experience to use continuity as a
primary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes
associated with normal aging. To the extent that
change builds upon, and has links to, the person's
past, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both
their own perceptions and pressures from the social
environment, individuals who are adapting to normal
aging are both predisposed and motivated
toward inner psychological continuity as well as outward
continuity of social behavior and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=978-0471338604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuity theory views both internal and
external continuity as robust adaptive strategies that
are supported by both individual preference and
social sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general
adaptive principles that people who are normally 
aging could be expected to follow, explanations of
how these principles work, and a specification of
general areas of life in which these principles could
be expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory
has enormous potential as a general theory of
adaptation to individual aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age stratification theory ====
According to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s that define "age strata". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

==== Life course theory ====
According to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993),&lt;ref name=life&gt;Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

Also reflecting the life course focus,
consider the implications for how societies might function when age-based
norms vanish—a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course—
and suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging
and the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,
morbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the
organization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and
leisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new
ways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as
well, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need
to be reconceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rowe, J.W. |author2=Kahn, R.L. |title=Successful aging |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0375400452 }}&lt;br&gt;Webster, N. (2003). Webster's new American dictionary. New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cumulative advantage/disadvantage theory ====
According to this theory, which was developed beginning in the 1960s by Derek Price and Robert Merton and elaborated on by several researchers such as Dale Dannefer,&lt;ref name=Dennefer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dannefer D |title=Cumulative advantage/disadvantage and the life course: cross-fertilizing age and social science theory |journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=S327–37 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14614120 |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.6.S327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inequalities have a tendency to become more pronounced throughout the aging process. A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.&lt;ref name=Phillipson/&gt;

== Environmental gerontology ==
Environmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. |author2=Rodriguez-Rodriguez, V. |title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America. Policies and perspectives on environment and aging|year=2016|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-3-319-21418-4|page=284|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rowles, Graham D. |author2=Bernard, Miriam|title=Environmental Gerontology: Making Meaningful Places in Old Age|year=2013|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826108135|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scheidt, Rick J. |author2=Schwarz, Benyamin|title=Environmental Gerontology. What Now?|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-62616-3|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field emerged in the 1930s during the first studies on behavioral and social gerontology. In the 1970s and 1980s, research confirmed the importance of the physical and social environment in understanding the aging population and improved the quality of life in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wahl, H-W. |author2=Scheidt, R.J. |author3=Windley, P.G. |title=Annual Review of Gerontology and Geriatrics. Focus on Aging context: Socio-Physical Environments|year=2004|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0826117342|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies of environmental gerontology indicate that older people prefer to age in their immediate environment, whereas spatial experience and place attachment are important for understanding the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrews, GJ.  |author2=Phillips, DR.|title=Ageing and Place: Perspectives, Policy, Practice|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415481656|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research indicates that the physical-social environment is related to the [[longevity]] and [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]. Precisely, the [[natural environment]] (such as natural therapeutic [[landscapes]], [[therapeutic garden]]) contributes to active and healthy aging in the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 |issue=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography.

== Jurisprudential gerontology ==
Jurisprudential gerontology (sometimes referred to as "geriatric jurisprudence") is a specialization within gerontology that looks into the ways laws and legal structures interact with the aging experience. The field started from legal scholars in the field of [[elder law]], which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as [[therapeutic jurisprudence]], jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, [[End-of-life care|end of life]] care, or [[Nursing home residents' rights|nursing homes]] regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mlv15&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Therapeutic Jurisprudence and End-of-Life Medical Care: Physician Perceptions of a Statute's Impact Medical Law 15 Medicine and Law 1996|pages=201–17|journal=Medicine and Law|volume=15|issue=2|access-date=2018-03-20|year=1996|last1=Kapp|first1=Marshall B.|pmid=8908972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well being of older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doron|first=Israel|last2=Meenan|first2=Helen|date=2012|title=Time for Geriatric Jurisprudence|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/335324|journal=Gerontology|language=english|volume=58|issue=3|pages=193–6|doi=10.1159/000335324|pmid=22538767|issn=0304-324X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grey goo''' (also spelled '''gray goo''') is a hypothetical [[doomsday event|end-of-the-world]] scenario involving [[molecular nanotechnology]] in which out-of-control [[self-replicating robots]] consume all biomass on [[Earth]] while building more of themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grey Goo is a Small Issue |url=http://www.crnano.org/BD-Goo.htm |date=2003-12-14 |accessdate=2009-12-28 |publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nanotechnology pioneer slays "grey goo" myths |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/06/040609072100.htm |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2009-12-28 |work=Nanotechnology |publisher=[[Institute of Physics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a scenario that has been called ''[[ecophagy]]'' ("eating the environment", more literally "eating the habitation").&lt;ref name="freitas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations|first=Robert A.|last=Freitas Jr.|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Ecophagy.htm|date=April 2000|accessdate=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea assumed machines were designed to have this capability, while popularizations have assumed that machines might somehow gain this capability by accident.

[[self-replication|Self-replicating]] machines of the macroscopic variety were originally described by mathematician [[John von Neumann]], and are sometimes referred to as [[Self-replicating machine|von Neumann machines]] or [[clanking replicator]]s.
The term ''gray goo'' was coined by nanotechnology pioneer [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Apocalypse 2012 |last= Joseph |first= Lawrence E. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= Broadway |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7679-2448-1 |page= 6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he stated, "I wish I had never used the term 'gray goo'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/429591b |pmid=15190320 |title=Nanotech takes small step towards burying 'grey goo' |year=2004 |last1=Giles |first1=Jim |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6992 |pages=591|url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038%2F429591b}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Engines of Creation'' mentions "gray goo" in two paragraphs and a note, while the popularized idea of gray goo was first publicized in a mass-circulation magazine, ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', in November 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life, OMNI, Vol. 9 No. 6, November 1986, p. 56ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term was first used by molecular nanotechnology pioneer [[Eric Drexler]] in his book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (1986). In Chapter 4, ''Engines Of Abundance'', Drexler illustrates both [[exponential growth]] and inherent limits (not gray goo) by describing [[nanomachines]] that can function only if given special raw materials:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine such a replicator floating in a bottle of chemicals, making copies of itself...the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four, and the eight build another eight. At the end of ten hours, there are not thirty-six new replicators, but over 68 billion. In less than a day, they would weigh a ton; in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;if the bottle of chemicals hadn't run dry long before.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Drexler, the term was popularized by an article in science fiction magazine ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', which also popularized the term ''nanotechnology'' in the same issue. Drexler says [[arms control]] is a far greater issue than grey goo "nanobugs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtube.com/watch?v=50iAoe7bs9o?t=3385 Dr Eric Drexler - Nanotechnology: The Big Picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] broadcast, a contrasting idea (a kind of gray goo) is referred to in a futuristic [[End time|doomsday]] scenario:
"In a common practice, billions of nanobots are released to clean up [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|an oil spill off the coast of Louisiana]]. However, due to a programming error, the nanobots devour all carbon based objects, instead of just the hydrocarbons of the oil. The nanobots destroy everything, all the while, replicating themselves. Within days, the planet is turned to dust."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler describes gray goo in Chapter 11 of ''Engines of Creation'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early assembler-based replicators could beat the most advanced modern organisms. 'Plants' with 'leaves' no more efficient than today's solar cells could out-compete real plants, crowding the biosphere with an inedible foliage. Tough, omnivorous 'bacteria' could out-compete real bacteria: they could spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to dust in a matter of days. Dangerous replicators could easily be too tough, small, and rapidly spreading to stop&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;at least if we made no preparation. We have trouble enough controlling viruses and fruit flies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Drexler notes that the geometric growth made possible by self-replication is inherently limited by the availability of suitable raw materials.

Drexler used the term "gray goo" not to indicate color or texture, but to emphasize the difference between "superiority" in terms of human values and "superiority" in terms of competitive success:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though masses of uncontrolled replicators need not be grey or gooey, the term "grey goo" emphasizes that replicators able to obliterate life might be less inspiring than a single species of crabgrass. They might be "superior" in an evolutionary sense, but this need not make them valuable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bill Joy]], one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, discussed some of the problems with pursuing this technology in his now-famous 2000 article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, titled "[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]". In direct response to Joy's concerns, the first quantitative technical analysis of the [[ecophagy]] scenario was published in 2000 by nanomedicine pioneer [[Robert Freitas]].&lt;ref name="freitas"/&gt;

==Risks and precautions==
Drexler more recently conceded that there is no need to build anything that even resembles a potential runaway replicator. This would avoid the problem entirely. In a paper in the journal ''[[Nanotechnology (journal)|Nanotechnology]]'', he argues that self-replicating machines are needlessly complex and inefficient. His 1992 technical book on advanced nanotechnologies ''[[Nanosystems|Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html |title=Nanosystems: molecular machinery, manufacturing, and computation |first=K. Eric |last=Drexler |publisher=Wiley |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-471-57518-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes manufacturing systems that are desktop-scale factories with specialized machines in fixed locations and conveyor belts to move parts from place to place. None of these measures would prevent a party from creating a weaponized grey goo, were such a thing possible.

[[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] called upon the British [[Royal Society]] to investigate the "enormous environmental and social risks" of nanotechnology in a planned report, leading to much media commentary on grey goo. The Royal Society's report on nanoscience was released on 29 July 2004, and declared the possibility of self-replicating machines to lie too far in the future to be of concern to regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm| title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties| publisher=The Royal Society| accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent analysis in the paper titled ''Safe Exponential Manufacturing'' from the [[Institute of Physics]] (co-written by Chris Phoenix, Director of Research of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, and Eric Drexler), shows that the danger of grey goo is far less likely than originally thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm| date=9 June 2004| title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective| publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology| accessdate=2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other long-term major risks to society and the environment from nanotechnology have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm| title= Current Results of Our Research| publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology| accessdate=2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drexler has made a somewhat public effort to retract his grey goo hypothesis, in an effort to focus the debate on more realistic threats associated with knowledge-enabled nanoterrorism and other misuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3788673.stm| title=Nanotech guru turns back on 'goo'| publisher= BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-30|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Safe Exponential Manufacturing'', which was published in a 2004 issue of ''Nanotechnology'', it was suggested that creating manufacturing systems with the ability to self-replicate by the use of their own energy sources would not be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phoenix|first=Chris|author2=Eric Drexler|title=Safe Exponential Manufacturing|journal=Nanotechnology|date=August 2004|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/15/8/001 |volume=15|issue=8|pages=869–72|url=http://rachel.org/lib/safe_exponential_manufacturing.040601.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foresight Institute also recommended embedding controls in the molecular machines. These controls would be able to prevent anyone from purposely abusing nanotechnology, and therefore avoid the grey goo scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html| title=Foresight Guidelines for Responsible Nanotechnology Development| publisher= Foresight Institute and IMM|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and chaos==

Grey goo is a useful construct for considering low-probability, high-impact outcomes from emerging technologies. Thus, it is a useful tool in the [[ethics of technology]]. [[Daniel A. Vallero]] applied it as a worst-case scenario [[thought experiment]] for technologists contemplating possible risks from advancing a technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biomedical Ethics for Engineers: Ethics and Decision Making in Biomedical and Biosystem Engineering|first=Daniel|last=Vallero |publisher=Academic Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780080476100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires that a [[decision tree]] or [[event tree]] include even extremely low probability events if such events may have an extremely negative and irreversible consequence, i.e. application of the [[precautionary principle]]. Dianne Irving admonishes that "any error in science will have a rippling effect..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Science, the formation of conscience and moral decision theory|last1=Irving |first1=Dianne|journal=Proceedings of the Guadalupan Appeal: The Dignity and Status of the Human Embryo, Mexico City, Mexico|date=October 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vallero adapted this reference to chaos theory to emerging technologies, wherein slight permutations of initial conditions can lead to unforeseen and profoundly negative downstream effects, for which the technologist and the new technology's proponents must be held accountable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5392">The '''human spirit''' is a component of human [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[art]], and [[knowledge]] - the spiritual or mental part of humanity. While the term can be used with the same meaning as "human soul",  human spirit is sometimes used to refer to the impersonal, universal or higher component of human nature in contrast to [[soul]] or '''''psyche''''' which can refer to the ego or lower element. The human spirit includes our intellect, emotions, fears, passions, and creativity.

In the models of [[Daniel A. Helminiak]] and [[Bernard Lonergan]], human spirit is considered to be the mental functions of [[awareness]], [[insight]], [[understanding]], [[judgement]] and other reasoning powers.  It is distinguished from the separate component of [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] which comprises the entities of [[emotion]], [[image]]s, [[memory]] and [[Personality type|personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL9hwUBJm18C |title=The human core of spirituality: mind as psyche and spirit |author=Daniel A. Helminiak |isbn=978-0-7914-2950-1 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Teske views human spirit as a [[social construct]] representing the qualities of purpose and [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] which transcend the individual human.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6i5ynN9qX30C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA189 |title=The human person in science and theology |chapter=The Social Construction of the Human Spirit |author=John Teske |isbn=978-0-567-08692-1 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between the human spirit and soul==
According to  historian [[Oswald Spengler]], a distinction between Spirit and Soul has been made by the West and earlier civilizations which influenced its development.&lt;ref name = "spengler"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Spengler
|first=Oswald
|title=The Decline of the west(An abridged edition)
|chapter= vol2, chpt: 3 &amp; 8
|year=1922
|isbn=1-4000-9700-2
|publisher= Vintage Books, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The human spirit can be seen as the heavenly component of  human's non material makeup -  the part that is impersonal or universal.  Whereas souls are the personal element unique to each individual.  As Spengler writes in ''[[The Decline of the West]]'':

{{cquote| ... more important than all this is the opposition of Spirit and Soul (Hebrew: ''ruach'' and ''nephesh'', Persian: ''ahu'' and ''urvan'', Mandasan: ''monuhmed'' and ''gyan'', Greek: ''pneuma'' and ''psyche'') which first comes out in the basic feeling of the prophetic religions, then pervades the whole of Apocalyptic, and finally forms and guides the world-contemplations of the awakened Culture - as seen with Philo, Paul and Plotinus, Gnostics and Mandeans, Augustine and the Avesta, Islam and the Kabbalah. ''Ruach'' means originally "wind" and ''nephesh'' "breath."  The ''nephesh'' is always in one way or another related to the bodily and earthly, to the below, the evil, the darkness. Its effort is the "upward." The ''ruach'' belongs to the divine, to the above, to the light. Its effects in man when it descends are the heroism of a Samson, the holy wrath of an Elijah, the enlightenment of the judge (e.g. Solomon passing judgment) and all kinds of divination and ecstasy. It is poured out. As in Isaiah xi, x, the Messiah becomes the incarnation of the ''ruach''.&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;}}

In Christianity, the [[Bible]] identifies humanity's three basic elements: spirit, soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%205:23&amp;version=NIV 1 Thes 5:23]&lt;/ref&gt;  Christians emphasise  that the human spirit is the 'real person', the very core of a person's being, the essential seat of their existence. When a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Saviour, it is their human spirit that is transformed as they become 'new creatures' in Jesus Christ. The soul which is the seat of the will, mind and emotions does not get converted but needs to be renewed on a daily basis through the recommended Christian disciplines such as prayer and reading the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 1 Cor 6:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 2 Cor 5:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV Rom 12:2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, Muslims are viewed as having their own spirits, but one that in a sense is one with God's spirit. For [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]], the perception of unity this idea led to was important for the emergence of the "consensus" that maintained harmony in Islamic culture, especially during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;

==Ancient moral intellectualism==
In the view of [[Socrates]] (c. 470 – 399 BC), intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that [[virtue]] is a purely intellectual matter, since virtue and [[knowledge]] are familial relatives, which a person accrues and improves with dedication to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} (Definition and note on Socrates)&lt;/ref&gt; So defined, [[Socratic intellectualism]] became a key philosophic doctrine of [[Stoicism]]. The apparent, problematic consequences of this view are “Socratic paradoxes”, such as the view that there is no [[weakness of will]] — that no one knowingly does, or seeks to do, evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are not many virtues, but that all virtues are one.

Contemporary philosophers dispute that Socrates’s conceptions of knowing truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post–[[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No one errs willingly: the meaning of socratic intellectualism | author=Heda Segvic | url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151328/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, [[Michel Foucault]] demonstrated, with detailed historical study, that in [[Classical Antiquity]] (800 BC – AD 1000), “knowing the truth” is akin to “spiritual knowledge”, in the contemporarily understanding of the concept. Hence, without exclusively concerning the rational intellect, spiritual knowledge is integral to the broader principle of “caring for the self”.

Typically, such care of the self-involved specific [[ascetic]] exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a [[Value (ethics)|good]] person. Therefore, to understand truth meant “intellectual knowledge” requiring one’s integration to the (universal) truth, and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentically]] living it in one’s speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the [[Rhetoric|Classical]]-era rhetorical device of [[parrhesia]]: “to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking”; and, by extension, practice the [[Morality|moral]] obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) ''Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject'', Lectures at the College de France 1981–1982. Picador: New York&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as [[Reason|rational]] undertakings.

==Medieval theological intellectualism&lt;!--'Medieval theological intellectualism' redirects here; linked from 'Averroes', 'Thomas Aquinas', and 'Meister Eckhart'--&gt;==
'''Medieval theological intellectualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of [[intellect]] precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (''voluntas intellectum sequitur''). As such, Intellectualism is contrasted with [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]], which proposes the Will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that “according to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined”.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/v/voluntar.htm | title = Voluntarism| publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish [[Islam|Muslim]] polymath [[Averroës]] (1126–1198) in the 12th century, the Italian Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), and the German Christian theologian [[Meister Eckhart]] (1260–1327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett, ''A Companion to Meister Eckhart'', BRILL, 2012, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jedediah Aaker''' is a musician, performer, theatrical producer, and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]-area personality. A fixture on cable series ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'', he has appeared in more episodes than anyone besides the series' two leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=15 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Portlandia |url=https://www.ifc.com/2014/12/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-portlandia |date=December 2014 |website=''IFC'' |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDX-native is also a multiple-award-winning, ''Whisker Wars''-celebrated competitive bearder who co-founded the Portland Beardsmen.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jamie |first1=Hale |title=Portland beardsman Jedediah Aaker prepares for the World Beard and Moustache Championships |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/portlands_resident_beardsmen_j.html |date=23 October 2014 |website=''The Oregonian'' |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Portlandia''==
''Portlandia'' first entered the global consciousness after satirical music video &lt;q&gt;Dream of the ‘90s&lt;/q&gt; premiered online in December 2010 and thrust [[Saturday Night Live]] star [[Fred Armisen]] between a motley assemblage of circus folk, exotic dancers, and idiosyncratically-styled local luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wappler |first1=Margaret |title='Portlandia': Where the dream of the '90s lives on... |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/01/portlandia-where-the-dream-of-the-90s-lives-on-1.html |date=6 January 2011 |website="Los Angeles Times" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing directly to the right of Armisen throughout the video while wearing only star-spangled swim briefs, black leather, and a sizable beard, Aaker stood out as the swiftly-trending clip sparked interest worldwide in the forthcoming sketch comedy series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Aaron |title=Portlanders Bid Mixed Goodbyes To 'Portlandia' |url=https://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/portlandia-final-season-portland-oregon-reaction/ |date=24 January 2018 |website="OPB" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, Aaker soon became widely known as, in the words of ''Willamette Week'', &lt;q&gt;that guy in underwear and a leather jacket in the ‘Dream of the ‘90s’ clip.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Willamette Geek: The Week in Geek |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-28088-willamette-geek-the-week-in-geek.html |date=16 January 2012 |website=''Willamette Week'' |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to serving as a [[Extra (acting)|background actor]] on several episodes, Aaker has played a scavenger hunt umpire, a member of Spyke’s wedding party, and a guest at [[List of Portlandia characters|Nina]]'s birthday party.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Locker |first1=Melissa |title=The Citizens of Portlandia: Jedediah Aaker |url=https://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia/blog/2014/01/citizens-of-portlandia-jedediah-aaker |website="IFC" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranking the &lt;q&gt;Best and Worst&lt;/q&gt; of the series’ third season, ''[[Portland Monthly]]'' critic John Chandler determined the &lt;q&gt;hirsute man-about-town&lt;/q&gt; tied with a veteran theater actress for &lt;q&gt;Best Performance By A Local&lt;/q&gt;. Although &lt;q&gt;Aaker plays himself (presumably)&lt;/q&gt; in episodes four and five, Chandler wrote, &lt;q&gt;the man’s beard has star quality.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chandler |first1=John |title=Portlandia Season 3: The Best and Worst So Far |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2013/1/31/portlandia-season-3 |date=31 January 2013 |website="Portland Monthly" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By season four, Aaker had appeared in almost two dozen of the 37 episodes then filmed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Additionally, he served as [[Kumail Nanjiani]]'s assistant on [[webisode]]s of IFC's travelogue series ''Kumail Tours Portland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia/blog/2013/01/portlandia-kumail-visits-a-tiny-house-in-portlandia|title=Kumail Nanjiani visits Portlandia’s tiniest house|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the series finished its eighth and final season in the spring of 2018, its network [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] estimated that the collective number of Aaker's various performances ranked below only co-founders [[Armisen]] and [[Carrie Brownstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Sean |title=15 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About Portlandia |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/60769/15-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-portlandia |date=29 December 2014 |website="Mental Floss" |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Portraitlandia"===
In 2013, during a month-long residency at Portland’s Newspace Center for Photography, acclaimed [[San Francisco]] photographer Kirk Crippens sought out 45 PDX locals for a series of portraits eventually titled "Portraitlandia". Over the next year, according to ''Portland Monthly'', the &lt;q&gt;series went viral, drawing millions of eyes to the site of its photographer.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Aaron |title=Portraitlandia Asks Us: What Do We Look Like (NSFW) |url=https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2014/1/17/portraitlandia-january-2014 |date=17 January 2014 |website=Portland Monthly |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images from the Portraitlandia series would be exhibited at London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in conjunction with the [[Taylor Wessing#Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize|Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize]] and toured the United States as part of the Photolucida exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosenberg |first1=David |title=Up-Close and Quirky Photos With the Glorious Residents of Portland |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2013/11/14/kirk_crippens_portraitlandia_examines_the_quirky_residents_of_portland_photos.html |date=14 November 2013 |website=Slate |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Crippens told [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] that he’d &lt;q&gt;expected his work to stand in sharp contrast to the fictions&lt;/q&gt; of ''Portlandia'', the artist found &lt;q&gt;significant overlap&lt;/q&gt; – particularly so when the first episode he saw after beginning the project happened to showcase Aaker and another two planned subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brook |first1=Pete |title=Portraitlandia Confirms and Refutes Everything You Think About Portland |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/portraitlandia/ |date=10 July 2013 |website=Wired |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker, &lt;q&gt;a man about town who owns his own lion suit,&lt;/q&gt; was among Crittens’ favorite subjects.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; For their shoot, Crittens said Aakers made available the roof of the nightclub where he tended bar and then asked the photographer &lt;q&gt;if I wanted him to curl up like a kitty in the ivy growing over the top of the roof. Yes, yes I did.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Gregory Eddi |title=Interview with Kirk Crippens, the Artist Behind ‘Portraitlandia’ |url=https://petapixel.com/2013/10/29/interview-kirk-crippens-photographer-behind-portraitlandia/ |date=29 October 2013 |website="PetaPixel" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Aaker has been involved with several NW rock bands. He spent years playing bass for the Fabulous Miss Wendy, a performer who has toured with [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and was lauded as the &lt;q&gt;sexiest rock star ever&lt;/q&gt; by [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cavuto |first1=Robert |title=The Fabulous Miss Wendy – No One Can Stop Me! |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2012/09/17/wendy/ |date=17 September 2017 |website=Guitar International |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He’s a founding member and bassist of The Gnash, whose music he has compared to &lt;q&gt;a primer-gray broken down Camaro.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The group recently put out a split single on the [[Voodoo Doughnut Recordings]] label entitled &lt;q&gt;She Took My Doughnut (And Left Me the Hole)&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.voodoodoughnutrecordings.com/artists/the-gnash/scuzz-rock-split/|title=Scuzz Rock Split • Voodoo Doughnut Recordings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He’s currently a member of the re-united Lucky Thirteens with former Weaklings vocalist Bradly Battin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2255777-The-Lucky-Thirteens|title=The Lucky Thirteens|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battins and Aaker previously played together in short-lived 00s group DARLINS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/darlins|title=♫ A Last Time For Everything - Darlins. Listen @cdbaby|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One venue owner explained the Lucky Thirteens’ sound as &lt;q&gt;fun, poppy-punk like you’d hear coming out of the jukebox ... back in 2000.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Labor Temple Bar Resurrects Portland Punk Scene |url=http://www.coastweekend.com/cw/music/20180530/labor-temple-bar-resurrects-portland-punk-scene |date=30 May 2018 |website=Coast Weekend |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years throughout the 2000s, Aaker served as frontman of glam metal group Diamond Tuck &amp; The Privates – &lt;q&gt;an eight-piece band carefully culled from the lifers of the Portland rock scene.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vegas |first1=Viva Las |title=Stripper Sluts Hit The Road With Portland's Two Hottest Rock Bands: Diamond Tuck &amp; The Privates and Starantula |url=http://www.xmag.com/archives/11-12-jun04/feature2.html |date=June 2004 |website="Exotic Magazine" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Willamette Week'' referred to their appearance on a (local punk mainstay) Club 21 compilation as &lt;q&gt;epic … buttrock.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soule |first1=Sam |title=VARIOUS ARTISTS Club 21, Fuck Yeah!

==Theater==
In 2009, Aaker and Diamond Tuck guitarist &lt;q&gt;Private&lt;/q&gt; Mike Albano led the live band during performances of writer/director/producer Jeffery &lt;q&gt;Wonderful&lt;/q&gt; Wilson’s rock opera ''Chariots of Rubber'' during performances at the [[Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/events/1489094/chariots-of-rubber|title=Chariots of Rubber|website=Portland Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review from the [[Portland State University]] [[Daily Vanguard|Vanguard]], described the original score as &lt;q&gt;1980s metal with a dash of [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Rocky Horror Picture Show]].&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kinney |first1=Anita |title=The Passion of the Metal Areola Snatchers |url=http://psuvanguard.com/the-passion-of-the-metal-areola-snatchers/ |date=29 October 2009 |website=PSU Vanguard |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Aaker and Wilson again joined forces as, respectively, producer and director of ''Hot Gun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Lee |title=Original Performances on Unique Stages Reinvent Portland Theater |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2010/07/original_performances_on_uniqu.html |date=1 July 2010 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;q&gt;rock ’n’ roll re-imagining of the iconic blockbuster [[Top Gun]]&lt;/q&gt; was performed live on stage at PDX nightclub [[Dante's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hallet |first1=Allison |title=Top Gun: The Musical |url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2010/04/09/top-gun-the-musical |date=9 April 2010 |website="The Portland Mercury" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review from ''Portland Monthly'', their critic admired the multimedia production’s deft manipulation of the original film – inserting previously-shot scenes of the stage actors into aerial battles – but found the comedy’s &lt;q&gt;laughs were loudest with the in-crowd.

A year later, Aaker brought John Walterich’s online-dating satire ''Brie'' to the stage of the Tonic Lounge for a brief run. ''Willamette Week'' critic Jonathan Frochtzwajg described the production as &lt;/q&gt;a largely amateur, very tattooed cast ... scored live by rotating punk-rock acts.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Frochtzwajg |first1=Jonathan |title=Brie |url=https://issuu.com/willametteweek/docs/38.05_-_willamette_week__december_7 |date=7 December 2011 |website=Willamette Week |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
Aaker acted in the 2017 film ''Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time'' alongside TV icons [[Walter Koenig]] ([[Pavel Chekov|Ensign Pavel Chekov]])and [[David Ogden Stiers]] ([[List of M*A*S*H characters#Charles Winchester|Major Charles Emerson Winchester]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4394034/|title=Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was a central figure in the 2017 documentary ''Thank You for Supporting the Arts'', which also features [[Gus Van Sant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt7391464/|title=Thank You for Supporting the Arts|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doc explores the physical and emotional trauma suffered by author and exotic dancer Liv &lt;q&gt;Viva Las Vegas&lt;/q&gt; Osthus following her fight against breast cancer and subsequent mastectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perry |first1=Douglas |title=Documentary about iconic Portland stripper Viva Las Vegas screens for local audiences |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/documentary_about_iconic_portl.html |date=30 April 2017 |website="The Oregonian" |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osthus and Aaker were in a relationship for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Osthus |first1=Liv |title=A Reality Show for Couples Therapy?

==Hosting==
As a judge for the 2011 West Coast Beard and Mustache Championships, Aaker appeared in a 2011 episode of the ''Whisker Wars'' cable reality series. &lt;q&gt;You're not judging on what's the biggest or the longest but ... the grandest,&lt;/q&gt; he told the ''Oregonian''. &lt;q&gt;It just has the magic glow ...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He’s also regularly called upon to help select the winners of various events around the Portland area such as the Bacon Cup, the Iron Bartender competition, the horror short GuignolFest, and Portland’s inaugural Pudding Wrestling Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pdxpipeline.com/events/july-16-bacon-cup-ash-st-saloon-bacon-wrestling-strippers-music-recipes/|title=July 16: Bacon Cup @ Ash St Saloon - Bacon Wrestling, Strippers, Music, Recipes|date=15 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yelp.com/events/portland-iron-bartender-2010|title=Iron Bartender 2010, Portland, OR|website=Yelp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portlandtribune.com/pt/11-features/121371-bits--and--pieces|title=Bits &amp; Pieces|first=Jason|last=Vondersmith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-18956-headout-puddin-slam.html|title=Headout: Puddin' Slam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] article that takes its title (&lt;q&gt;Every Vagina Is A Snowflake&lt;/q&gt;) from a quote given by Aaker, the magazine noted that the &lt;q&gt;returning judge&lt;/q&gt; brought his own props overseeing the beauty pageant for exotic dancers' nether regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shepard |first1=Susan Elizabeth |title=Every Vagina Is a Snowflake: A Dispatch from Portland's Vagina Beauty Pageant |url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/qvddxv/every-vagina-is-a-snowflake-a-dispatch-from-portlands-vagina-beauty-pageant |date=5 August 2015 |website=Vice |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bearding==
Aaker has been cultivating his beard for more than ten years.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; He’s become a notable figure in competitive bearding events, winning several freestyle awards, and can be seen in the first season of IFC series ''Whisker Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rob |first1=Owen |title=IFC's 'Whisker Wars' Focuses on Competitive Beard Growing?

At the 2014 [[World Beard and Moustache Championships]] held inside Portland’s [[Keller Auditorium]], which hosted 300 contestants from ten countries, Aaker emerged as a fan favorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=Hairy Controversy Surrounds World Beard and Moustache Championships, Coming to Portland This Weekend |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/hairy_controversy_surrounds_wo.html |date=23 October 2014 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oregonian'' reported that he "somehow got extra time, walking onstage in short shorts and a white fur coat, his red beard shaped into a flying V guitar, gyrating his belly to the roar of the crowd. He walked away with sixth place, but he stole the audience's heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=World Beard and Moustache Championships Draws Huge Crowd to Portland, Spirals Into Chaos Onstage |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/world_beard_and_moustache_cham_1.html |date=25 October 2014 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Aaker helped found the Portland Beardsmen – a band of facial-hair enthusiasts who compete for prizes awarded on the merits of beard size, grooming, style, creativity, and other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandbeardsmen.com|title=Home|website=The Portland Beardsmen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nonprofit group raises funds for transportation to far-flung tournaments, and they also organize charitable efforts such as beard-wielded car washes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |first1=FOX 12 |title=Portland Beardsmen Surprise Moms with Flower Deliveries |url=http://www.kptv.com/story/31819718/portland-beardsmen-surprise-moms-with-flower-deliveries |date=25 October 2014 |website=KPTV |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their annual Beards N Roses drive each Mother’s Day, hirsute members don brightly-colored tights and tutus for delivering bouquets to Portland-area moms. Aaker helped originate the program six years ago to benefit the [[Uprise Books Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Jamie |title=Portland Beardsmen Don Tutus, Deliver Mother's Day Flowers Around the City |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/05/portland_beardsmen_don_tutus_d.html |date=9 May 2015 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portland Beardsmen===
On the evening of August 28, 2012, Aaker was among 13 bearded men detained at gunpoint by officers from the [[Portland Police Bureau|Portland police]] on the [[Burnside Bridge]] during what ''the Oregonian'' termed "a military-themed photo shoot for breast cancer awareness." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bailey Jr. |first1=Everton |title=Rifle, body armor on Burnside Bridge lead to arrests during 'Beards for Breasts' photo shoot |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/08/rifle_body_armor_on_burnside_b.html |date=30 August 2012 |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an unnamed observer’s [[9-1-1|911]] call alerted authorities about suspicious characters wearing camouflaged body armor, both sides of the bridge were closed for nearly an hour as the police investigated the situation. Two men were taken into custody for disorderly conduct and carrying an (unloaded) AR-15 assault rifle through a public space.

According to [[KPTV]] News, the group was organized by Aaker to aid a national fundraising campaign entitled &lt;q&gt;Beards for Breast Cancer&lt;/q&gt; that was assembling a calender featuring pictures of bearding groups from around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webstaff |first1=FOX 12 |title=Burnside Bridge scare suspects: 'We are the good guys' |url=http://www.kptv.com/story/19423445/burnside-bridge-scare-suspects-we-are-the-good-guys?clienttype=printable |date=30 August 2012 |website="KPTV" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Portland contingent was designated to appear alongside July, Aaker thought the resulting photo should feel especially patriotic, which led several of the beardsmen to don militaristic garb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |first1=KING |title=Bearded men on bridge cause alarm, but it's all for charity |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/bearded-men-on-bridge-cause-alarm-but-its-all-for-charity/330729166 |date=30 August 2012 |website="KING-TV" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[KATU]] News reported that Aaker himself had on an [[NSYNC]] T-shirt.) "We are the good guys," Aaker told the station, "just a bunch of dudes walking across the bridge wearing camo getting rad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kalkstein |first1=Meghan |title='Just a bunch of dudes walking across the bridge wearing camo' |url=https://kval.com/news/offbeat/just-a-bunch-of-dudes-walking-across-the-bridge-wearing-camo-11-21-2015 |date=28 August 2012 |website="KVAL" |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blick auf A 2 bei Raststätte Lehrter See (2009).jpg|right|thumb|Right-hand traffic on the [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]] in [[Germany]]]]
[[File:Autoroute M25.jpg|right|thumb|Left-hand traffic on the [[M25 motorway]] in the [[UK]]]]

'''Left-hand traffic''' (LHT) and '''right-hand traffic''' (RHT) are the practice, in [[bidirectional traffic]], of keeping to the left side or to the right side of the road, respectively. A fundamental element to [[traffic]] flow, it is sometimes referred to as the '''rule of the road'''.&lt;ref name="kincaid"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Peter |authorlink= |title=The Rule of the Road: An International Guide to History and Practice |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=December 1986 |location= |pages=50, 86–88, 99–100, 121–122, 198–202 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-313-25249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RHT is used in 163 countries and territories, with the remaining [[List of countries with left-hand traffic|78 countries and territories using LHT]]. Countries that use LHT account for about a sixth of the world's area with about 35% of humanity and a quarter of its roads.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barta|first1=Patrick |title=Shifting the Right of Way to the Left Leaves Some Samoans Feeling Wronged |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125086852452149513 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=4 December 2016}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, 104 of the world's territories were LHT and an equal number were RHT. From 1919 to 1986, 34 of the LHT territories switched to RHT.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Ian|title=The rule of the road, 1919-1986: A case study of standards change|url=http://www.ianwatson.org/rule_of_the_road.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the countries with LHT were formerly part of the [[British Empire]]. In addition, [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Suriname]] and other countries have retained the LHT tradition. Conversely, many of the countries with RHT were formerly part of the [[French colonial empire]] or, in Europe, were subject to French rule during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic conquests]].

For [[Rail transport|rail traffic]], LHT predominates in Western Europe (except [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]]), Latin America, and in countries formerly in the British and French Empires, whereas North American and central and eastern European train services operate RHT.

According to the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], water traffic is effectively RHT: a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to [[starboard]] (the right-hand side), and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also. For aircraft the US [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] suggest RHT principles, both in the air and on water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airweb.faa.gov/REGULATORY_AND_GUIDANCE_LIBRARY%5CRGFAR.NSF/0/2EA99FD06D59A9BC852566CF00614DEA FAR Sec. 91.115](c): "When aircraft, or an aircraft and a vessel, are approaching head-on, or nearly so, each shall alter its course to the right to keep well clear."&lt;/ref&gt;

In healthy populations, traffic safety is thought to be the same regardless of [[handedness]], although some researchers have speculated that LHT may be safer for ageing populations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foerch | first1 = C | last2 = Steinmetz | first2 = H | year = 2009 | title = Left-sided traffic directionality may be the safer "rule of the road" for ageing populations | url = | journal = Med Hypotheses | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 20–3 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.01.044 | pmid = 19327893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since humans are more commonly [[ocular dominance|right-eye dominant]] than left-eye dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Dominant Eye and Why it Matters|url=http://www.optilase.co.uk/your-dominant-eye-and-why-it-matters/|accessdate=11 December 2016|date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Roman troops kept to the left when marching.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Charles|title=Puzzles and Essays from the Exchange Essays|date=2003|publisher=Haworth Information Press|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, archaeologists found a well-preserved double track leading to a Roman quarry near [[Swindon]], in southern England. The grooves in the road on the left side (viewed facing down the track away from the quarry) were much deeper than those on the right side, suggesting LHT, at least at this location, since carts would exit the quarry heavily loaded, and enter it empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walters|first1=Bryn|title=Huge Roman Quarry found in North Wiltshire|journal=ARA the Bulletin of the Association for Roman Archaeology|volume=Autumn 1998|issue=Six|pages=8–9|url=http://www.associationromanarchaeology.org/ARA_Bulletin6.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2016|issn=1363-7967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reference in [[English law]] to an order for LHT was in 1756, with regard to [[London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="hamer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamer|first1=Mike|title=Left is right on the road|journal=New Scientist|issue=20 December 1986/1 January 1987|pages=16–18|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qfak8nsMNGIC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=25 December 1986 – 1 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians, such as [[C. Northcote Parkinson]], believed that ancient travellers on horseback or on foot generally kept to the left, since most people were right-handed. If two men riding on horseback were to start a fight, each would edge toward the left.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; In the year 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] directed pilgrims to keep left.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;

In the late 1700s, traffic in the United States was RHT based on [[teamster]]s' use of large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. The wagons had no driver's seat, so the (typically right-handed) [[postilion]] held his whip in his right hand and thus sat on the left rear horse. Seated on the left, the driver preferred that other wagons pass him on the left so that he could be sure to keep clear of the wheels of oncoming wagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Why We Drive on the Right of the Road, ''Popular Science Monthly'', Vol.126, No.1, (January 1935), p.37 |accessdate=25 April 2012|publisher=Bonnier Corporation |date=January 1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, traditionally foot traffic had kept right, while carriage traffic kept left. Following the [[French Revolution]], all traffic kept right.&lt;ref name="hamer"/&gt; Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French imposed RHT on parts of Europe.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim is found widely in popular literature but no reliable source has been seen|date=March 2018}} During the colonial period, RHT was introduced by the French in [[New France]], [[French West Africa]], the [[Maghreb]], [[French Indochina]], the [[West Indies]], [[French Guiana]] and the [[Réunion]], among others.

Meanwhile, LHT was introduced by the British in parts of Canada ([[Atlantic Canada]] and [[British Columbia]]), Australia, New Zealand, the [[East Africa Protectorate]] (now Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]], [[Rhodesia]] and the [[Cape Colony]] (now Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa), [[British Malaya]] (now Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore), [[British Guiana]], and [[British Hong Kong]]. LHT was also introduced by the [[Portuguese Empire]] in [[Portuguese Macau]], [[Colonial Brazil]], [[Portuguese Timor]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Angola]].

The first keep-right law for [[driving in the United States]] was passed in 1792 and applied to the [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]].&lt;ref name="On The Right Side of the Road"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weingroff|first=Richard|title=On The Right Side of the Road|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/right.cfm|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] formalized RHT in 1804, [[New Jersey]] in 1813 and [[Massachusetts]] in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/handle/2452/110303 |title=An Act Establishing the Law of the Road |publisher=Massachusetts General Court |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s some countries including [[Canada]], [[Spain]], and [[Brazil]] had different rules in different parts of the country. During the 1900s many countries standardised within their jurisdictions, and changed from LHT to RHT, mostly to conform with regional custom. Currently nearly all countries use one side or the other throughout their entire territory. Most exceptions are due to historical considerations and/or involve islands with no road connection to the main part of a country. [[China]] is RHT except the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. The [[Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge]] is RHT even though both Hong Kong and Macau are LHT. The [[United States]] is RHT except the [[United States Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usvitourism.vi/travel_tips|title=Travel Tips &amp;#124; US Virgin Islands|publisher=Usvitourism.vi|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom is LHT, but its [[British Overseas Territory|overseas territories]] of [[Gibraltar]] and [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] are RHT.

==Changing sides==
[[File:Kungsgatan 1967.jpg|thumb|Traffic moves from left to right in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], on 3 September 1967]]

===Europe===

Influential in Europe was the 1920 Paris Convention, which advised driving on the right-hand side of the road, in order to harmonise traffic across a continent with many borders. This was despite the fact that left-hand traffic was still widespread: in 1915 for example, LHT was introduced everywhere in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]; however, three years later the Empire was split up into several countries, and they all changed eventually to RHT, notably including when Nazi Germany [[switch to right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia|introduced RHT with almost immediate effect in Czechoslovakia]] in 1938–39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasold|first1=Manfred|title=Obacht!

Nevertheless, some years later the government ordered a conversion, which took place at 5 am on Sunday, 3 September 1967. The accident rate dropped sharply after the change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TIME |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C941144%2C00.html? |title=Sweden: Switch to the Right |publisher=TIME |date=15 September 1967 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018034155/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941144,00.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon rose back to near its original level.&lt;ref name="salon20090814"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mieszkowski |first=Katharine |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/14/driving_on_left/ |title=Salon News: Whose side of the road are you on? |publisher=Salon.com |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was known as ''[[Dagen H]]'' ("H-Day"), the 'H' being for ''Högertrafik'' ("right traffic").

In the late 1960s, the UK [[Department for Transport]] considered switching to RHT, but declared it unsafe and too costly for such a built-up nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8239048.stm |title=Could the UK drive on the right?  |author=Tom Geoghegan  |date=7 September 2009 |work=BBC News Magazine |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road building standards, for motorways in particular, allow asymmetrically designed road junctions, where merge and diverge lanes differ in length.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, four countries in Europe continue to use left-hand traffic, all island nations: the UK, [[Cyprus]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Malta]].

===Asia and the Pacific===

[[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Nationalist China]] adopted RHT in 1946. This convention was preserved when the [[Communist Party of China|CCP]] took the mainland and the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] retreated to Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau continue to be LHT.

Both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] switched to RHT in 1945 after liberation from Japanese colonial power.

[[Myanmar]] switched to RHT in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Unique World of Burmese Driving | website=a minor diversion | date=2012-03-14 | url=http://www.minordiversion.com/2012/03/the-unique-world-of-burmese-driving/ | accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samoa]], a former German colony, had been RHT for more than a century. It switched to LHT in 2009,&lt;ref name="BBC Samoa"&gt;{{Cite news|  title =Samoan cars ready to switch sides|  publisher =BBC News | date = 7 September 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8240992.stm | accessdate = 7 September 2009 | first=Nick | last=Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the first territory in almost 30 years to switch.&lt;ref name="reuters Samoa"/&gt; The move was legislated in 2008 to allow Samoans to use cheaper right-hand drive (RHD) vehicles—which are better suited for left-hand traffic—imported from Australia, New Zealand or Japan, and to harmonise with other South Pacific nations. A political party, [[The People's Party (Samoa)|The People's Party]], was formed to try to protest against the change, a protest group which launched a legal challenge,&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10594375"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10594375 |title=Right-to-life plea fails to sway Samoan court in road appeal |author=Dyer, Gwynne |authorlink=Gwynne Dyer |date=1 September 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 18,000 people attending demonstrations against it.&lt;ref name="BBC Samoa2"&gt;{{Cite news|  title =Samoa drivers brace for left turn|  publisher =BBC News | date = 6 September 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8236773.stm | accessdate = 7 September 2009 | first=Michael | last=Dobie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motor industry was also opposed, as 14,000 of Samoa's 18,000 vehicles are designed for RHT and the government has refused to meet the cost of conversion.&lt;ref name="reuters Samoa"&gt;{{Cite news|  title =Outcry as Samoa motorists prepare to drive on left|  publisher =Reuters | date = 7 September 2009 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5861QV20090907| accessdate = 7 September 2009| first=Pauline| last=Askin}}&lt;/ref&gt; After months of preparation, the switch from right to left happened in an atmosphere of national celebration. There were no reported incidents.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; At 05:50 local time, Monday 7 September, a radio announcement halted traffic, and an announcement at 6:00 ordered traffic to switch to LHT.&lt;ref name="BBC Samoa"/&gt; The change coincided with more restrictive enforcement of speeding and seat-belt laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/samoan-drivers-change-from-right-hand-side-of-the-road-to-the-left/story-e6frf7lf-1225770454009 |title=Samoan drivers change from right-hand side of the road to the left |publisher=Heraldsun.com.au |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day and the following day were declared public holidays, to reduce traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10523412 |title=Samoa announces driving switch date|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date= 25 July 2008|accessdate=10 June 2012 |first=Cherelle |last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change included a three-day ban on alcohol sales, while police mounted dozens of checkpoints, warning drivers to drive slowly.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

The Philippines was mostly LHT during its [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/bibliotecabne/8219320037/ Plaza Mayor de Manila], by [[José Honorato Lozano]] (1815/21(?)-1885), in the album [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bibliotecabne/sets/72157632106172948/ ''Vistas de las islas Filipinas y trajes de sus habitantes''], published 1847.

RHT was formally finalised by Executive Order No. 34 signed by President [[Sergio Osmeña]] on 10 March 1945.&lt;ref name="E.O. 34 1945"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/03/10/executive-order-no-34-s-1945/|title=Executive Order No. 34, s. 1945|work=www.officialgazzete.gov.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

A number of non-contiguous former British colonies in [[West Africa]] originally drove LHT and switched to RHT in the early 1970s to match the surrounding countries. [[Sierra Leone]] switched to RHT in 1971, [[Nigeria]] in 1972 and [[Ghana]] in 1974. Before this period [[The Gambia]], a country entirely contained within RHT Senegal, had officially switched to RHT in 1965.&lt;ref name="TBD Gambia" /&gt;

[[Rwanda]], a former Belgian colony in central Africa, is RHT but is considering switching to LHT, to bring the country in line with other members of the [[East African Community]] (EAC).&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.ug/index.php/news/regional-news/78-regional-news/1458-rwanda-wants-to-drive-on-the-left |title=Rwanda wants to drive on the left |publisher=Independent.co.ug |date=3 June 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey, carried out in 2009, indicated that 54% of Rwandans were in favour of the switch. Reasons cited were the perceived lower costs of RHD vehicles as opposed to LHD versions of the same model, easier maintenance and the political benefit of harmonisation of traffic regulations with other EAC countries. The same survey also indicated that RHD cars are 16 to 49 per cent cheaper than their LHD equivalents.&lt;ref name="business"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201009271438.html |title=East Africa: Rwanda Looks to the Left |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=27 September 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 an internal report from consultants to the Ministry of Infrastructure recommended a switch to LHT.&lt;ref name=ETRR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bari|first1=Dr Mahabubul|title=The study of the possibility of switching driving side in Rwanda|journal=European Transport Research Review|volume=6|issue=4|pages=439–453|date=29 July 2014|doi=10.1007/s12544-014-0144-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the ban on RHD vehicles was lifted; RHD trucks from neighbouring countries cost $1000 less than LHD models imported from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/Rwanda/Business/Right-hand-drive-vehicles-return-on-Rwandan-roads-/1433224-2652722-1hwl76/index.html Right-hand-drive vehicles return on Rwandan roads], ''[[The East African]]'', March 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tumwebaze|first1=Peterson|title=Govt okays importation of RHD trucks, to decide on other vehicle categories in October|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2014-09-09/538/business-govt-okays-importation-of-right-hand-drive-trucks,-to-decide-on-other-vehicle-categories-in-october|accessdate=29 October 2014|publisher=The New Times|date=9 September 2014|ref=newtimes2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
In one study, researchers concluded that left-hand traffic may be safer for elderly drivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foerch | first1 = C | last2 = Steinmetz | first2 = H | year = 2009 | title = Left-sided traffic directionality may be the safer "rule of the road" for ageing populations | url = | journal = Med Hypotheses | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 20–3 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.01.044 | pmid = 19327893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since humans are more commonly [[ocular dominance|right-eye dominant]] than left-eye dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Your Dominant Eye and Why it Matters| url=http://www.optilase.co.uk/your-dominant-eye-and-why-it-matters/| accessdate=2016-12-11| date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing accident statistics between countries operating either LHT or RHT, Leeming concluded that LHT is superior.&lt;ref&gt;Leeming, J. J. 1969. Road accidents: prevent or punish? London: Cassell&lt;/ref&gt; However, Watson has criticised the small sample size and dismisses the notion.&lt;ref name="watson"/&gt;

==Changing sides at borders==
[[File:Drive-on-the-left-kent-1b.jpg|thumb|right|A road sign in the British county of [[Kent]] placed on the right-hand side of the road.]]
[[File:Danish motorcyclists about to cross the border between Sweden and Norway in 1934.png|thumb|right|Border between Sweden and Norway in 1934]]
Although many LHT jurisdictions are on islands, there are cases where vehicles may be driven from LHT across a border into a RHT area. Such borders are mostly located in Africa and southern Asia. The [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] regulates the use of foreign registered vehicles in the 74 countries that have ratified it.

LHT [[Thailand]] has three RHT neighbors: [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]]. Most of its borders use a simple traffic light to do the switch, but there are also interchanges which enable the switch while keeping up a continuous flow of traffic.&lt;ref name="cnt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=Ken|title=What Happens When Left-Hand Roads Meet Right-Hand Roads|url=http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2013-04-15/lotus-bridge-macau-maphead-ken-jennings|website=Conde Nast Traveler|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four road border crossing points between Hong Kong and Mainland China. In 2006, the daily average number of vehicle trips recorded at Lok Ma Chau was 31,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2006/en/13_08.htm |title=Hong Kong 2006 – Transport – Cross-Boundary Traffic |publisher=Yearbook.gov.hk |date=15 August 2007 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next largest is [[Man Kam To]], where there is no changeover system and the border roads on the mainland side [[Wenjindu]] intersect as one-way streets with a main road.

The [[Takutu River Bridge]] (which links LHT [[Guyana]] and RHT [[Brazil]]&lt;ref name="Takutu bridge opens to traffic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2009/news/local/04/27/takutu-bridge-opens-to-traffic-2 |title=Takutu bridge opens to traffic |publisher=Stabroeknews.com |date=27 April 2009 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the only border in the Americas where traffic changes sides.

Although the United Kingdom is separated from [[Continental Europe]] by the [[English Channel]], the level of cross-Channel traffic is very high; the [[Channel Tunnel]] alone carries 3.5 million vehicles per year, by rail, between the UK and France.

==Road vehicle configurations==
===Driver seating position===
&lt;!-- **This page uses UK spelling variations. Please do not change this spelling to curb.** --&gt;
[[File:Bolivia Yunga Road.jpg|thumb|right|Bolivia is RHT, with the exception of [[Yungas Road]] which is LHT to help drivers see their outer wheel.]]
In RHT jurisdictions, vehicles are configured with LHD, with the driver sitting on the left side. In LHT jurisdictions, the reverse is true. The driver's side, the side closest to the centre of the road, is sometimes called the ''offside'', while the passenger side, the side closest to the side of the road, is sometimes called the ''nearside''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/nearside |title=Nearside (dictionary definition) |publisher=Dictionary.reverso.net |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This article uses UK English. --&gt;

Historically there was less consistency in the relationship of the position of the driver to the handedness of traffic. Most American cars produced before 1910 were RHD.&lt;ref name="On The Right Side of the Road"/&gt; In 1908 [[Henry Ford]] standardised the [[Model T]] as LHD in RHT America,&lt;ref name="On The Right Side of the Road"/&gt; arguing that with RHD and RHT, the passenger was obliged to "get out on the street side and walk around the car" and that with steering from the left, the driver "is able to see even the wheels of the other car and easily avoids danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Wayne|title=Car Crazy: The Battle for Supremacy between Ford and Olds and the Dawn of the Automobile Age|date=2015|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395526|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JgIrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=car+crazy+wayne+miller|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915 other manufacturers followed Ford's lead, due to the popularity of the Model T.&lt;ref name="On The Right Side of the Road"/&gt;

In specialised cases, the driver will sit on the nearside, or kerbside. Examples include:
*Where the driver needs a good view of the nearside, e.g. [[street sweeper]]s, or vehicles driven along unstable road edges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhdspecialist.com/location_of_the_steering_wheel.php LHD Specialist: Location of the Steering Wheel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921030931/http://www.lhdspecialist.com/location_of_the_steering_wheel.php |date=21 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Where it is more convenient for the driver to be on the nearside, e.g. delivery vehicles. The [[Grumman LLV]] postal delivery truck is widely used with RHD configurations in RHT North America. Some [[Unimog]]s are designed to switch between LHD and RHD to permit operators to work on the more convenient side of the truck.

Generally, the convention is to mount a motorcycle on the left,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Mark|title=How to mount your motorbike|url=https://motorbikewriter.com/mount-motorbike/|accessdate=11 December 2016|date=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kickstand]]s are usually on the left&lt;ref name="tips"&gt;{{cite web|title=MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING A MOTORCYCLE|url=http://www.motorcycletesttips.uk/motorcycle-riding-tutorials/mounting-and-dismounting-a-motorcycle/|website=Motorcycle Test Tips|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it more convenient to mount on the safer kerbside&lt;ref name="tips"/&gt; as is the case in LHT. Some jurisdictions prohibit fitting a [[sidecar]] to a motorcycle's offside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/si/5/made/en/print|title=S.I.

===Headlamps and other lighting equipment===
{{Main|Headlamp}}

[[File:Low beam light pattern for right-hand traffic.svg|thumb|left|Bird's-eye view of low beam light pattern for RH traffic, with long seeing range on the right and short cutoff on the left so oncoming drivers are not dazzled.]]

Most low-beam headlamps produce an asymmetrical light suitable for use on only one side of the road. Low beam headlamps in LHT jurisdictions throw most of their light forward-leftward; those for RHT throw most of their light forward-rightward, thus illuminating obstacles and road signs while minimising glare for oncoming traffic.

In Europe, headlamps approved for use on one side of the road must be adaptable to produce adequate illumination with controlled glare for temporarily driving on the other side of the road,&lt;ref name="R112"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/R112rev2_e.pdf |title=UN Regulation 112, "Motor vehicle headlamps emitting an asymmetrical passing beam or a driving beam or both and equipped with filament lamps" }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|p.13 ¶5.8}}. This may be achieved by affixing masking strips or prismatic lenses to a part of the lens or by moving all or part of the headlamp optic so all or part of the beam is shifted or the asymmetrical portion is occluded.&lt;ref name=R112/&gt;{{RP|p.13 ¶5.8.1}} Some varieties of the [[Headlamp#Projector (polyellipsoidal) lamps|projector-type headlamp]] can be fully adjusted to produce a proper LHT ''or'' RHT beam by shifting a lever or other movable element in or on the lamp assembly.&lt;ref name=R112/&gt;{{RP|p.12 ¶5.4}} Some vehicles adjust the headlamps automatically when the car's [[GPS]] detects that the vehicle has moved from LHT to RHT and vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Because blackout strips and adhesive prismatic lenses reduce the safety performance of the headlamps, most countries require all vehicles registered or used on a permanent or semi-permanent basis within the country to be equipped with headlamps designed for the correct traffic-handedness.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Without [[sidecar]]s attached, motorcycles, [[motor scooter]]s, [[moped]]s, and [[bicycle]]s are almost symmetric with their handlebars in the centre. However, motorcycles are often equipped with automotive-type asymmetrical-beam headlamps that likewise require adjustments or replacement when brought into a country with opposite traffic-handedness.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====Rear fog lamps====

In the European Union, vehicles must be equipped with one or two red [[Automotive Lighting#Rear fog lamps|rear fog lamps]]. A single rear fog lamp must be located between the vehicle's longitudinal centreline and the outer extent of the driver's side of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2015/R048r12e.pdf|title=UN Regulation 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rear fog lamps are also being found on vehicles produced for Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

===Crash testing differences===
An Australian news source reports that some RHD cars imported to that country did not perform as well on crash tests as the LHD versions, although the cause is unknown, and may be due to differences in testing methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popular family SUV Hyundai Tucson slammed for 'four-star' Australian crash test result|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/popular-family-suv-hyundai-tucson-slammed-for-fourstar-australian-crash-test-result/news-story/466995147eb262b628fc71ca5e1cd89b|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide distribution by country==
Of the 194 countries currently recognised by the [[United Nations]] (and the unrecognised [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Kosovo|Kosovo]]), 140 use RHT and 54 use LHT. A country and its territories and dependencies is counted once.

The rest of Ukraine, having been part of the [[Russian Empire]], already drove on the right.&lt;br&gt;Some sections of [[Kryvyi Rih Metrotram]] use LHT due to tramcars have doors only on right side, which makes it impossible to use RHT at stations with island platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mqng0q_pWI|title=Криворожский скоростной трамвай|last=Vril|date=13 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Virgin Islands]], like much of the Caribbean, is LHT and is the only American jurisdiction that still has LHT, because the islands drove on the left when the US purchased the former [[Danish West Indies]] from Denmark in 1917 (known as the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies]].)

'''Mika Aaltonen''' (born 16 November 1965) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] former [[association football|footballer]]. His position was an attacking central midfielder. He also played for the [[Finland national football team|Finnish national team]].

During his career (1982–1994) he played in [[Finland]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], and [[Israel]] for [[Turun Palloseura|TPS]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], [[AC Bellinzona|Bellinzona]], [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]], [[Hertha BSC]], [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.]] and [[Tampereen Pallo-Veikot]]. He finished his career at a relatively young age because of a persistent ankle injury, and because of this, he ended up concentrating more on his studies. Aaltonen studied throughout his playing career, and after he retired from football, he earned a doctorate degree in economics.

Aaltonen is best remembered for a superb goal scored against Italian goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]] in [[UEFA Cup]] in 1987 during a match between [[Turun Palloseura]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] at the [[San Siro]] stadium in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/sport/4638-the-miracle-of-san-siro.pdf | title = Helsinki Times}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal more or less earned him a transfer to Inter shortly afterwards.

The early modern age saw various economic changes as well as several significant diseases that have affected the mortality rates. Data collection during this time was not consistent or broadly recorded and there have been efforts to reconstruct plausible statistics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Thomas|title=The Work of the Dead: A Cultural History of Mortal Remains|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=72|issue=4|pages=504–506|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrx024|issn=0022-5045|via=|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates vary on geographic location, social environment, and cultural values.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There were also gender differences in the mortality rates, leading to an excess mortality rate in urban areas and in the female population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Derosas|first=Renzo|title=Life Under Pressure: Mortality And Living Standards In Europe And Asia, 1700-1900|date=|url=|work=Infant and Child Mortality|volume=|pages=327–398, 431–440|publisher=|isbn=|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Breschi|first2=Marco|last3=Fornasin|first3=Alessio|last4=Manfredini|first4=Matteo|last5=Munno|first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main cause of death was [[stillbirth]], which could be attributed to, but not limited to, maternal infections, birth complications, and congenital anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/epidemiology/stillbirth/en/|title=Stillbirths|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another contributing factor to the mortality rate was food insecurity and shortages as well as unemployment, both of which varied per region.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Post|first=John D.|date=1990|title=The Mortality Crises of the Early 1770s and European Demographic Trends|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=21|issue=1|pages=29|doi=10.2307/204917|issn=0022-1953|jstor=204917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final factor was violence, which occurred mainly due to [[Structural violence|structural]] or systemic violence; however, violence since the 12th century has been steadily falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Campbell|first=Roderick Campbell|title=Toward a Deep History of Violence and Civilization|url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=2084655|work=Violence and Civilization: Studies of Social Violence in History and Prehistory|volume=|pages=1–22|publisher=|isbn=9781782976202|access-date=2018-07-25|date=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Steven Pinker on the myth of violence|last=Pinker|first=Steven|date=2007|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|doi = 10.1037/e597002010-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Collection ==
Data from the early modern age was not accurately or consistently collected. However, there have been a number of studies and reconstructed statistics from this era, particularly on children and women. There has not been any empirical research published and the only information has been theoretical as there has been insufficient data and sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was also common for many statistics to go unreported; this is especially true regarding unmarried women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Models and theoretic equations need to take into account "social, economic, cultural, geographical, and even climatological variables" in order to accurately reflect the statistics of the time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==
One study, the Eurasia Project, has shown that boys, especially those under one year, had a higher mortality rate during childhood than girls, but the mortality rate for men and women were about equal. It has also been shown that there is a higher male mortality than female mortality rate during the time of famine. Male mortality has also been linked to "economic modernization and urbanization ... especially for cardiovascular disease".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women faced increased mortality during childbirth as pregnancy and childbirth compromised the mother's immune system, with the most common causes of death being [[Postpartum infections|puerperal fever]], [[Pre-eclampsia|toxemia]], and [[Postpartum bleeding|hemorrhage]]. These dangers suggest an association to the excess female mortality, especially considering that women had to compete more for resources as they had no property rights and had a lower ranking in the household hierarchy. The average age of childbearing differed between Asia and Europe with an average difference of five years, which would affect cross-cultural data collection. Children born to mothers 35 years or older had a higher risk of mortality than children born to younger mothers. linking a mother's health and a child's survival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Female infants and children often had a higher mortality rate, especially in times of food insecurity, compared to male infants and children. However, a maternal presence worked as a protective factor for children. regardless of age or gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Economics ==
Food insecurity and shortages were common throughout this time period and were matched with the high food prices and high unemployment rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is shown through the differences in mortality rates between the lower and upper class, with poor infants being up to two times more likely to die than their wealthier counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 17th century Europe, it was common that at least one in five children from the same family would die before the age of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21375348|title=Making sex : body and gender from the Greeks to Freud|last=Walter.|first=Laqueur, Thomas|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674543492|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=21375348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this high rate, it was common for there to be a large amount of children in one family so that there would be a higher rate of survival. Especially among poorer families, having multiple children was common in order to ensure there would be children to contribute to the family later on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the early modern era, house calls were common. If the patient was female, the doctor, commonly an upper class male, would typically be summoned by a male family member who wound remain throughout the examination. The physician and male family member would then discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan without the female's input. This practice reinforced and perpetuated social hierarchies and patriarchal values.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Furth|first=Charlotte|date=1999-03-05|title=A Flourishing Yin: Gender in China's Medical History|journal=Isis|volume=93|issue=3|pages=479–480|doi=10.1086/374084|isbn=9780520208292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and diseases ==

Food shortages and insecurity were leading concerns in the 18th century, especially in Europe, and these were exacerbated by reduced harvests yields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disease was another leading cause of death, with rats and fleas being the common carriers of disease, specifically plagues, during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|title=FAQ {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]] was a plague that affected much of the world, originating in Asia and spreading to Europe through diseased fleas and rats. This epidemic has been reported to have been the cause of death for approximately "60% of the European population".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the end of the 19th century, there was a plague, known as the [[Third plague pandemic|Modern Plague]], that started in China and spread to different cities through ports, reportedly causing roughly ten million deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/history/index.html|title=History {{!}} Plague {{!}} CDC|date=2018-05-31|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plague affected Asia, the Americas, and Africa and lasted into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There were also epidemics that occurred locally and did not spread to national levels, notably in 18th century England.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These local epidemics included fevers, dysentery, smallpox, starvation, typhoid fever, under-nutrition, cholera, malaria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By the end of the era, [[disease]] and [[malnutrition]] were no longer the main leading causes of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40122">'''''Mycoplasma laboratorium''''' is a designed, partially [[synthetic biology|synthetic]] species of [[bacterium]] derived from the [[genome]] of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]''. This effort in [[synthetic biology]] is being undertaken at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] by a team of approximately 20 scientists headed by [[Nobel laureate]] [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]] and including [[DNA]] researcher [[Craig Venter]] and [[microbiologist]] [[Clyde A. Hutchison III]].  ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' was chosen as it was the species with the smallest number of genes known at that time.

On May 21, 2010, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] reported that the Venter group had successfully synthesized the genome of the bacterium ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' from a computer record and transplanted it into an existing cell of ''[[Mycoplasma capricolum]]'' that had its DNA removed. The team used ''M. mycoides'' instead of ''M. genitalium'' because it grew faster. The new bacterium was viable—that is, capable of [[bacterial replication|replicating]] billions of times—but not, strictly speaking, a truly synthetic life form.&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists create synthetic cell, version 1.0|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20005533-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

It is estimated that the synthetic genome cost US$40 million and 200 [[man-hour#Similar units|man-years]] to produce.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"/&gt; Despite the controversy, Venter's company [[Synthetic Genomics]] has secured over $110 million in investment capital and inked a $300 million deal with [[Exxon Mobil]] to design [[algae fuel|algae for diesel fuel]].&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt;

{{main|Mycoplasma}}

''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' was chosen as it was the species with the smallest number of genes known at that time.

''Mycoplasma'' is a genus of [[bacteria]] of the class [[Mollicutes]] in the division [[Tenericutes]], characterised by the lack of a [[cell wall]] (making it [[Gram negative]]) due to its [[parasitism|parasitic]] or [[commensalism|commensal]] lifestyle.

''[[Pelagibacter ubique]]'' (an [[Alphaproteobacteria|α-proteobacterium]] of the order [[Rickettsiales]]) has the smallest known genome (1,308,759 base pairs) of any free living organism and is one of the smallest self-replicating cells known.

==Minimal genome project==
The team started with the bacterium ''M. genitalium'', an [[obligate intracellular parasite]] whose [[genome]] consists of 482 [[gene]]s comprising 582,970 [[base pairs]], arranged on one circular [[chromosome]] (the smallest genome of any known natural organism that can be grown in free culture). They then systematically removed genes to find a minimal set of 382 genes that can sustain life.&lt;ref group="a" name="minimal"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This effort was also known as the '''Minimal Genome Project'''.

The team intends to synthesize chromosome DNA sequences consisting of these 382 genes. Once a version of the minimal 382-gene chromosome has been synthesized, it is intended to be transplanted into a ''M. genitalium'' cell to create Mycoplasma laboratorium.

The resulting Mycoplasma laboratorium bacterium is expected to be able to [[DNA replication|replicate]] itself with its man-made DNA, making it the most synthetic organism to date, although the molecular machinery and chemical environment that would allow it to replicate would not be synthetic.&lt;ref group="b" name="pilk"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003, the team had reported a fast method of synthesizing a genome from scratch, producing the 5386-base genome of the [[bacteriophage]] [[Phi X 174]] in about two weeks.&lt;ref  group="a" name="virus"&gt;{{Cite journal

Venter hopes to eventually synthesize bacteria to manufacture [[hydrogen]] and [[biofuel]]s, and also to absorb [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. [[George M. Church]], another pioneer in [[synthetic biology]], holds that ''[[E. coli]]'' is a more efficient organism than ''M. genitalium'' and that creating a fully synthetic genome is not necessary and too costly for such tasks; he points out that synthetic genes have already been incorporated into ''E.coli'' to perform some of the above tasks.&lt;ref group="b" name=sciam&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=longest-piece-of-dna-yet Longest Piece of Synthetic DNA Yet], ''Scientific American News'', 24 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--copypaste--&gt;
On June 28, 2007, a team at the J. Craig Venter Institute published an article in ''Science Express'', saying that they had successfully transplanted the natural DNA from a ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' bacterium into a ''[[Mycoplasma capricolum]]'' cell, creating a bacterium which behaved like a ''M. mycoides''.&lt;ref group="a" name="transfer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On Oct 6, 2007, Craig Venter announced in an interview with UK's ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that the same team had synthesized a modified version of the single [[chromosome]] of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' [[Artificial gene synthesis|chemically]]. The chromosome was modified to eliminate all genes which tests in live bacteria had shown to be unnecessary. The next planned step in this ''minimal genome project'' is to transplant the synthesized minimal genome into a bacterial cell with its old DNA removed; the resulting bacterium will be called Mycoplasma laboratorium. The next day the Canadian [[bioethics]] group, [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] issued a statement through their representative, [[Pat Roy Mooney|Pat Mooney]], saying Venter's "creation" was "a chassis on which you could build almost anything". The synthesized genome had not yet been transplanted into a working cell.&lt;ref group="b" name="pilk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/oct/06/genetics.climatechange|publisher=The Guardian|date=6 Oct 2009 | accessdate=23 Nov 2012 | title=I am creating artificial life, declares US gene pioneer | location=London | first=Ed | last=Pilkington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 2010, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] reported that the Venter group had successfully synthesized the genome of the bacterium ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' from a computer record, and transplanted the synthesized genome into the existing cell of a ''Mycoplasma capricolum'' bacterium that had had its DNA removed. The "synthetic" bacterium was viable, i.e. capable of replicating billions of times. The team had originally planned to use the ''M. genitalium'' bacterium they had previously been working with, but switched to ''M. mycoides'' because the latter bacterium grows much faster, which translated into quicker experiments.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They have also shown that the natural genome of ''M. mycoides'' can be transplanted but has yet to show that the same could be done for ''M. genitalium''.&lt;ref group="b" name="kwok"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genomics: DNA's master craftsmen |author= Roberta Kwok |journal= Nature |year= 2010 |volume=468|issue=7320|pages=22–5 |doi= 10.1038/468022a |pmid=21048740 |bibcode = 2010Natur.468...22K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter describes it as "the first species.... to have its parents be a computer".&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8695992.stm |title=How scientists made 'artificial life' |accessdate=2010-05-21 | work=BBC News | date=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformed bacterium is dubbed "Synthia" by ETC.  A Venter spokesperson has declined to confirm any breakthrough at the time of this writing, likely because similar genetic introduction techniques such as [[transfection]], [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]], [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] and [[protofection]] have been a standard research practice for many years.

Now that the technique has been proven to work with the ''M. mycoides'' genome, the next project is presumably to go back to the minimized ''M. genitalium'' and transplant it into a cell to create the previously mentioned Mycoplasma laboratorium.

The creation of a new synthetic bacterium was announced in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] on March 25, 2016.  It has only 473 genes, the fewest genes of any freely living organism.   
This fast growing new cell, called Syn 3.0, was created by transplanting the genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, with all the unessential DNA removed, into a Mycoplasma capricolum, which had been emptied of its own DNA.

M. genitalium was not used because it reproduces too slowly.

==Bacterial genome transplantation==
In order to propagate a synthetic genome, the technique to transplant an intact whole bacterial genome into another had to be developed.
Oswald Avery's pioneering experiments in the 1940s showed that some bacteria could take up naked DNA,&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avery OT, Macleod CM, McCarty M | title=Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types : Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated From Pneumococcus Type III | journal=J Exp Med | date=Feb 1, 1944 | volume=79| issue=2 |pages=137–58 | doi=10.1084/jem.79.2.137 | pmid=19871359 | pmc=2135445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the advent of [[Molecular cloning|molecular cloning techniques]] DNA elements could be transformed into [[competent cells]], typically [[cloning vectors]], around 5-20 kbp long,  and even [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s can be maintained.
In 2007, Venter's team reported that they had managed to transfer the chromosome of the species ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' to ''Mycoplasma capricolum'' by means of:
* isolating the genome of ''M. mycoides'': gentle lysis of cells trapped in agar—molten agar mixed with cells and left to form a gel—followed by [[PFGE|pulse field gel electrophoresis]] and the band of the correct size (circular 1.25Mbp) being isolated;
* making the recipient cells of ''M. capricolum'' competent: growth in rich media followed starvation in poor media where the nucleotide starvation results in inhibition of DNA replication and change of morphology; and
* [[polyethylene glycol]]-mediated transformation of the circular chromosome to the DNA-free cells followed by selection.&lt;ref group="a" name="transfer"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Lartigue C, Glass JI, Alperovich N, Pieper R, Parmar PP, Hutchison CA 3rd, Smith HO, Venter JC | title= Genome transplantation in bacteria: changing one species to another | journal=Science | date=Aug 3, 2007 | volume=317 |issue=5838 |pages=632–8|bibcode = 2007Sci...317..632L |doi = 10.1126/science.1144622 | pmid=17600181| citeseerx= 10.1.1.395.4374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] is used to refer to insertion of a vector into a bacterial cell (by electroporation or heatshock). Here, transplantation is used akin to [[Nuclear transfer|nuclear transplantation]].

The switch from ''M. genitalium'' to ''M. mycoides'' was spurred due to the faster growth of the latter.&lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"/&gt;

==Bacterial chromosome synthesis==
It is possible to create DNA sequences with the use of chemicals ([[oligonucleotide synthesis]]) which is achieved by successive rounds of [[Protective group|deprotection and coupling]] of protected [[Phosphoramidite|phosphoramidite nucleotides]] with geometrically decreasing yields to length, making sequences longer than 1000 base-pairs unfeasible. For longer sequences, DNA ligation is required. In 2008 Venter's group published a paper showing that they had managed to create a synthetic genome (a copy of ''M. mycoides'' sequence [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/256384469 CP001621]) by means of a hierarchical strategy:&lt;ref group="a"  name="synthesis"/&gt;
*Synthesis → 1kbp: The genome sequence was synthesized by [http://www.blueheronbio.com/ Blue Heron] in 1078 1080bp cassettes with 80bp overlap and NotI restriction sites (inefficient but rare cutter).
*Ligation → 10kbp: 109 Groups of a series of 10 consecutive cassettes were ligated and cloned in E.coli on a plasmid and the correct permutation checked by sequencing, this would follow a [[geometric distribution]] with expected number of trials of 10.
*Multiplex PCR → 100kbp: 11 Groups of a series of 10 consecutive 10kbp assemblies (grown in yeast) were joined by multiplex PCR, using a primer pair for each 10kbp assembly.
*Isolation and recombination → secondary assemblies were isolated by means of the plug method above and joining and transformed into yeast spheroplasts without a vector sequence (present in assembly 811-900).

==Synthetic genome==

In 2010, using the  methods described above, Venter and colleagues created a strain of Mycoplasma mycoides called '''JCVI-syn1.0''' with a synthetic genome.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibson|first1=D.

Given the fact that the natural genome worked, the cause of the failed growth was an frameshift mutation in [[DnaA]], a [[Initiation factor|replication initiation factor]], which, once corrected, worked and was verified.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;

The construction of a cell with a synthetic genome was done to test the methodology—allowing more modified genomes to be created in the future. To minimize sources of failure, the genome was created using a natural genome as a template. Due to the large size of a genome, apart from the elements required for propagation in yeast and residues from restriction sites, several differences are present in ''Mycoplasma mycoides'' JCVI-syn1.0 notably an ''E.coli'' transposon IS1 (an infection from the 10kb stage) and an 85bp duplication.&lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;

However, the project has received heavy criticism as it claims to have created a synthetic organism. This claim arises from the fact that the genome was synthesized chemically in many pieces (a synthetic method), joined together by means of molecular biological techniques (an artificial method), and transplanted into the cytoplasm of a natural cell (after a few generations, though, the original protein content is undetectable){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.
The two species used as donor and recipient are of the same genus as the more distant two species are, the less the correct protein interactions are maintained, such as binding factors and binding sites, which mutate together ([[epistasis]]).&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Povolotskaya | first1 = IS | last2 = Kondrashov | first2 = FA | date = Jun 2010 | title = Sequence space and the ongoing expansion of the protein universe | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7300| pages = 922–6 | doi=10.1038/nature09105 | pmid=20485343| bibcode = 2010Natur.465..922P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, [[Paul Keim]] (a molecular geneticist at [[Northern Arizona University]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]) notes that "there are great challenges ahead before genetic engineers can mix match, and fully design an organism's genome from scratch" &lt;ref group="b" name="science_editorial"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pennisi E |title=Genomics.

DNA is the template for protein construction and requires proteins as helper molecules to do so, a chicken-and-egg conundrum solved by the [[RNA world hypothesis]], consequently synthetic naked DNA would require several proteins to create a viable cell. In 2000 and 2002 teams synthesized replicating [[hepatitis C virus]] (about 9600 nucleotides long)&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Efficient initiation of HCV RNA replication in cell culture |vauthors=Blight KJ, Kolykhalov AA, Rice CM | journal=Science | date=Dec 8, 2000 | volume=290 | issue=5498 | pages=1972–4| pmid= 11110665|bibcode = 2000Sci...290.1972B |doi = 10.1126/science.290.5498.1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[poliovirus]] (about 7500 nucleotides long),&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cello | first1 = J | last2 = Paul | first2 = AV | last3 = Wimmer | first3 = E | date = Aug 2002 | title = Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5583| pages = 1016–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1072266 | pmid=12114528| bibcode = 2002Sci...297.1016C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses, however, replicate by utilising host protein expression machinery. Furthermore, whereas DNA can easily be replicated (using [[DNA polymerase]]), transcribed (using [[RNA polymerase]]), and translated (using [[ribosomes]] and many other factors)—all ''in vitro'', such reactions, so far, use cell extracts and most components have not been synthesized de novo—that is from inorganic or synthetically made organic chemicals only.

===Watermarks===
[[File:Hidden watermark.jpg|thumb|A hidden watermark on a semiconductor chip from 1976, acting as a signature of its creators. In an analogous way, JC Venter and his team added watermarks using [[stop codon]]s to sign their creation.]]
A much publicised feature of the Mycoplasma laboratorium is the presence of watermark sequences as an ultimate proof of the achievement and as a publicity stunt—similar to the tradition of [[chip art]], inscriptions on unused portions of microchips visible only by electron microscopy. The 4 watermarks (present in figure 1 in supplementary material of &lt;ref group="a" name="synthcell"/&gt;) are coded messages in the form of DNA [[base pair]]s, of 1246, 1081, 1109 and 1222 base pairs respectively, in natural [[peptide sequence|peptides]] the 4 [[nucleotide]]s encode in [[codon|sets of 3]] the 20 natural amino acids by means of the [[genetic code|standard genetic code]]. Each amino acid ''by convention'' is represented by a letter, but in nature there is nothing which ties [[alanine]], a molecule, to the Latin letter [[A]], a vowel, so this convention was disregarded in the latter watermarks. In the minimal genome organism the watermark were encoded as amino acids, with [[V]] as [[U]], both in reference to Latin inscriptions and the lack of a standard amino acid for U containing the names of the researchers:
(VENTERINSTITVTE, CRAIGVENTER,  HAMSMITH,  CINDIANDCLYDE,  GLASSANDCLYDE).  In the synthetic organism, instead the Latin alphabet—which in English has 26 letters, which is covered only in base 4 with 3 or more digits—was encoded by an undisclosed encoding. The encoding is fixed and 3 digits make an uppercase letter or {{small caps|Ascii}} symbol, possibly randomly allocated (not [[ASCII table|{{small caps|Ascii}} table]], frequency or [[Keyboard layout|keyboard order]]).&lt;ref group="b"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Shirriff |url=http://www.arcfn.com/2010/06/using-arc-to-decode-venters-secret-dna.html |title=Using Arc to decode Venter's secret DNA watermark |publisher=Ken Shirriff's blog |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the watermarks is as follows:
# watermark 1 an {{Small caps|Html}} script which reads to a browser as  text congratulating the decoder with an email link to click to prove the decoding.
# watermark 2 contains a list of authors and a quote from [[James Joyce]]: "To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life".
# watermark 3 contains more authors and a quote from [[Robert Oppenheimer]] (uncredited): "See things not as they are, but as they might be".
# watermark 4 contains yet more authors and a quote from [[Richard Feynman]]: "What I cannot build, I cannot understand".

==Concerns and controversy==

===Press coverage===
The main controversy from the project is the undue amount of publicity it received from the press due to Venter's showmanship, to the degree that [[Jay Keasling]], a pioneering synthetic biologist and founder of Amyris says "The only regulation we need is of my colleague's mouth".&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"&gt;Andrew Pollack, His Corporate Strategy: The Scientific Method, NYTimes, September 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
Despite the funding for practical applications, as stressed by [[George M. Church]], one of the main players in the field of synthetic biology, a few changes are required to obtain useful organisms now, such as [[Biofuel from algae|biofuel production]] or [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt; However, speculation about the distant future's possible applications is rife.
Venter himself is prone to such speculations, having asked for example, "What if we can make algae taste like beef?"&lt;ref group="b" name="venterstrategy"/&gt; If it were possible to create  a synthetic cell without the use of preexisting recipient cells, however, many applications would become achievable which would be otherwise unattainable, such as a completely overhauled bacterium that works in a logically controlled way—removing what has been described as 'evolutionary messiness'&lt;ref group="a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tawfik | first1 = Dan S | year = 2010 | title = Messy biology and the origins of evolutionary innovations | url = | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 10| pages = 692–696 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.441 | pmid=20852602}}&lt;/ref&gt;—with lower mutation rates, categorical gene arrangement (colinearity), the possibility of adding [[Nucleic acid analogues|novel nucleotides]] to increase encoding (a feat achieved in vitro (PCR)); or with a completely novel genetic code, such as has been achieved by experiments in which a few [[Expanded genetic code|additional non-canonical amino acids]] were added.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">'''Necropolitics''' is the use of [[Power (social and political)|social and political power]] to dictate how some people may live and how some must die.

==Overview==
[[Achille Mbembe]], author of ''[[On the Postcolony]]'', was the first scholar to explore the term in depth in his article of the same name.&lt;ref name="mbembe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mbembe|first1=Achille|authorlink1=Achille Mbembe|title=Necropolitics|journal=Public Culture|date=2003|volume=15|issue=1|pages=11–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Necropolitics is often discussed with [[biopower]], the [[Foucauldian]] term for the use of social and political power to control people's lives.

Mbembe was clear that necropolitics is more than a right to kill (Foucault's ''droit de glaive''), but also the right to expose other people (including a country's own citizens) to death. His view of necropolitics also included the right to impose [[social death|social]] or [[civil death]], the right to enslave others, and other forms of [[political violence]].&lt;ref name="mbembe" /&gt; Necropolitics is a theory of the walking dead, namely a way of analysing how "contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the power of death"&lt;ref name="mbembe" /&gt; forces some bodies to remain in different states of being located between life and death. Mbembe uses the examples of slavery, apartheid, the colonisation of Palestine and the figure of the suicide bomber to show how different forms of necropower over the body (statist, racialised, a state of exception, urgency, martyrdom) reduce people to precarious conditions of life.

==Queer necropolitics==
[[Jasbir Puar]] coined the term ''queer necropolitics'' to analyze the [[post-9/11]] queer outrage regarding [[gay bashing]] and simultaneous queer complicity with [[Islamophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puar|first1=Jasbir K.|title=Terrorist assemblages : homonationalism in queer times|date=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=9780822340942|pages=32–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars use Puar's queer necropolics in conjunction with [[Judith Butler]]'s concept of a grievable life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Precarious life : the powers of mourning and violence|date=2004|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=978-1844670055|pages=20–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer necropolitics is the subject of an anthology from [[Routledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Haritaworn|editor1-first=Jin|editor2-last=Kuntsman|editor2-first=Adi|editor3-last=Posocco|editor3-first=Silvia|title=Queer necropolitics|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415644761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicotinamide mononucleotide''' ("'''NMN'''" and "'''β-NMN'''") is a [[nucleotide]] derived from [[ribose]] and [[nicotinamide]].&lt;ref name=Bogan2008/&gt; Like [[nicotinamide riboside]], NMN is a derivative of [[niacin]], and humans have enzymes that can use NMN to generate [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NADH).&lt;ref name=Bogan2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogan|first1=KL|last2=Brenner|first2=C|title=Nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and nicotinamide riboside: a molecular evaluation of NAD+ precursor vitamins in human nutrition.|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|date=2008|volume=28|pages=115–30|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.28.061807.155443|pmid=18429699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because NADH is a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for processes inside [[mitochondria]], for [[sirtuin]]s, and for [[Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase|PARP]], NMN has been studied in [[animal model]]s as a potential neuroprotective and [[anti-aging]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brazill|first1=JM|last2=Li|first2=C|last3=Zhu|first3=Y|last4=Zhai|first4=RG|title=NMNAT: It's an NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; synthase… It's a chaperone… It's a neuroprotector.|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|date=June 2017|volume=44|pages=156–162|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2017.03.014|pmid=28445802|pmc=5515290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Long-Term Administration of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Mitigates Age-Associated Physiological Decline in Mice|journal=Cell Metabolism|date=13 December 2016|url=https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(16)30495-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary supplement companies have [[Hard sell|aggressively marketed]] NMN products claiming those benefits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stipp|first1=David|title=Beyond Resveratrol: The Anti-Aging NAD Fad|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/beyond-resveratrol-the-anti-aging-nad-fad |work=[[Scientific American]] Blog Network |date=March 11, 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bigley&gt;Bigley, Sharon, ''[https://www.statnews.com/2018/03/22/dietary-supplement-makes-old-mice-spry/ A dietary supplement makes old mice youthful.

'''Peter Aaby''' ([[Danes|Danish]], born 1944 in [[Lund]], [[Sweden]]) is trained as an [[anthropologist]] but also holds a [[doctoral degree]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="Winkel, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkel|first1=Klaus|title=Danskere i tropisk Afrika : fra slavehandler til bistandsarbejder|date=2011|publisher=Klim|location=Århus|isbn=8779559271|edition=1. udgave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Peter Aaby established the [[Bandim Health Project]], a Health and Demographic Surveillance System site in [[Guinea-Bissau]] in [[West Africa]], which he has run ever since.&lt;ref name="Bandim, 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://bandim.org/about-bhp/background.aspx|website=Bandim Health Project|publisher=SSI|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Peter Aaby was awarded the [[Novo Nordisk]] Prize, the most important Danish award within [[Outline of health sciences|health research]].

Aaby is credited for the discovery of [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects of vaccines]] – i.e. effects of [[vaccine]]s, which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases.&lt;ref name="Prentice, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=AM|last2=Savy|first2=M|last3=Darboe|first3=MK|last4=Moore|first4=SE|title=Commentary: Challenging public health orthodoxies--prophesy or heresy?|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=April 2009|volume=38|issue=2|pages=591–3|pmid=19174540|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/2/591.short|doi=10.1093/ije/dyn363|pmc=2663722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of non-specific effects of vaccines was established in 1991 and later documented in several trials on [[measles vaccine]], [[BCG vaccine|BCG]], [[oral polio vaccine]], [[DTP vaccine]] and [[smallpox vaccine]].&lt;ref name="Benn, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Netea|first2=MG|last3=Selin|first3=LK|last4=Aaby|first4=P|title=A small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=September 2013|volume=34|issue=9|pages=431–9|pmid=23680130|doi=10.1016/j.it.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of Aaby’s work on non-specific effects of vaccines it has been recommended the WHO [[vaccination program]] in [[low income countries]] should be changed.&lt;ref name="Shann, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013|volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[WHO]] recently reviewed the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG vaccine, measles vaccine and DTP vaccine, and concluded that it would "keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Meeting of Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 18-19 June 2008|pmid=18689006 | volume=83 |issue=32 | date=Aug 2008|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|pages=287–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phaedon''''' ({{lang-de|Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele}}), published in 1767, is a book by the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]], in which Mendelssohn offers a defense of [[immortality]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Lenn E. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''Phaedon'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popkind"&gt;{{cite book |author=Popkin, Richard H. |editor=Audi, Robert |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=0-521-63722-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue [[Phaedo]], in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including [[Plotinus]], [[Descartes]], and [[Leibniz]], argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the ''Phaedon'', Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that [[Kant]] calls ''the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology''). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.

==Reception==
Materialistic views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls; 1767). Modelled on [[Plato]]'s dialogue of the same name, Mendelssohn's work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style. The Phaedon was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in German it was speedily translated into several European languages, including English. The author was hailed as the "German Plato," or the "German Socrates"; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that "no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates."

[[Immanuel Kant]] criticized Mendelssohn's argument for immortality in the second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787), at B413–15. Commentators disagree over whether Kant's criticism is successful. Mendelssohn's arguments have been largely overlooked by contemporary analytic philosophers, but philosophers including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[E.J. Lowe]] have offered arguments for the simplicity of the soul.

'''Religion of Humanity''' (from French ''Religion de l'Humanité'' or ''[[w:fr:église positiviste|église positiviste]]'') is a [[secular religion]] created by [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[Positivism|positivist]] philosophy. Adherents of this religion have built chapels of Humanity in [[France]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://membres.lycos.fr/clotilde/temple.htm
|title = Où peut-on visiter un temple positiviste ? (Where Are Positivist Shrines to be Seen?)
|accessdate = 2007-10-30
|language = French
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Europe, Comte's ideas influenced others, and contributed to the emergence of [[ethical movement|ethical societies]] and "ethical churches", which led to the development of Ethical culture, [[religious humanism|congregational humanist]], and [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] organisations.

==Origins==
Comte developed the ''religion of humanity'' for positivist societies in order to fulfill the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. The religion was developed after Comte's passionate platonic relationship with [[Clotilde de Vaux]], whom he idealised after her death. He became convinced that feminine values embodied the triumph of sentiment and morality. In a future science-based Positivist society there should also be a religion that would have power by virtue of moral force alone.&lt;ref name = "soci"&gt;Rollin Chambliss, ''Social Thought: From Hammurabi to Comte'', Dryden Press, New York, 1954, p.424.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the "[[positivist calendar]]", in which months were named after history's greatest leaders, thinkers, and artists, and arranged in chronological order. Each day was dedicated to a thinker.

==Tenets==
According to Tony Davies, Comte's secular and positive religion was "a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity", referred to as the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being). "This was later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Cosmic Space)".&lt;ref name = "dave"&gt;Davies, Tony. ''Humanism'', The New Critical Idiom. Drakakis, John, series editor. University of Stirling, UK. Routledge, 1997, p.28-29 {{ISBN|0-415-11052-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Système de politique positive'' (1851–1854) Comte stated that the pillars of the religion are: 
*'''altruism''', leading to generosity and selfless dedication to others.
*'''order''': Comte thought that after the [[French Revolution]], society needed restoration of order.
*'''progress''': the consequences of industrial and technical breakthroughs for human societies.

In ''Catéchisme positiviste'' (1851), Comte defined the Church of Humanity's seven [[sacrament]]s:
*'''Introduction'''; (nomination and sponsoring)
*'''Admission'''; (end of education)
*'''Destination'''; (choice of a career)
*'''Marriage''';
*'''Retirement'''; (age 63),
*'''Separation'''; (social extreme unction),
*'''Incorporation'''; (absorption into history) - 3 years after death.

==Liturgy and priesthood==
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre - Posse de Erlon Jacques de Oliveira 02.JPG|thumb|Erlon Jacques de Oliveira, Temple guardian in Porto Alegre|upright=1.2]]
The Religion of Humanity was described by [[Thomas Huxley]] as "Catholicism minus Christianity".&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt; In addition to a holy trinity of Humanity, the Earth and Destiny, it had a priesthood. Priests were ''required'' to be married, because of the ennobling influence of womanhood. They would conduct services, including Positivist prayer, which was "a solemn out-pouring, whether in private or in public, of men's nobler feelings, inspiring them with larger and more comprehensive thoughts." The purpose of the religion was to increase altruism, so that believers acted always in the best interests of humanity as a whole. The priests would be international ambassadors of altruism, teaching, arbitrating in industrial and political disputes, and directing public opinion. They should be scholars, physicians, poets and artists. Indeed all the arts, including dancing and singing should be practiced by them, like [[bard]]s in ancient societies.  

This required long training. They began training from the age of twenty-eight, studying in positivist schools. From thirty-five to forty-two a priest served in an apprentice position as teacher and ritualist. Only at the age of forty-two could he become a full priest. They earned no money and could not hold offices outside the priesthood. In this way their influence was purely spiritual and moral. The High Priest of Humanity was to live in Paris, which would replace Rome as the centre of religion.&lt;ref name = "soci"/&gt;

==Influence==
Davies argues that Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity - viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) - "was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx".&lt;ref name = "dave"/&gt;

The ''system'' was ultimately unsuccessful but, along with [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', it influenced the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and [[Harriet Martineau]], for the most part rejected the full panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour altrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").

Profound criticism came from [[John Stuart Mill]] who advocated Comte but dismissed his Religion of Humanity in a move towards a differentiation between the (good) early Comte, the author of ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' and the (problematic) late Comte, who authored the Religion of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See the central passage of Mill's ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'': John Stuart Mill on Auguste Comte’s Religion of Humanity ([http://positivists.org/blog/archives/3719])&lt;/ref&gt; While sympathising with the need for a [[secular religion]], and appreciating Comte’s respect for “the Human Race, conceived as a continuous whole, including the past, he present and the future”, Mill thought that the details of Comte’s ritualism were not only illiberal but “could have been written by no man who had ever laughed”.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, in A Ryan, ‘’J S Mill’’ (London 1974) p. 234-5&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Religion of Humanity in Brazil===
Comtean Positivism was relatively popular in Brazil. In 1881 Miguel Lemos and [[Raimundo Teixeira Mendes]] organized the "Positivist Church of Brazil." In 1897 the "Temple of Humanity" was created.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b3BA1k09JHUC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=%22religion+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=08euTo6046&amp;sig=PmQR3toJCZX2aCaXe8oUv7D5lvs&amp;hl=en Latin American Thought: Philosophical Problems and Arguments By Susana Nuccetelli: Page 184]&lt;/ref&gt; The services at the Temple could go on for up to four hours and that, combined with a certain moral strictness, led to some decline during the Republican period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SltigewTmMwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22temple+of+humanity%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=eWbqnsEKzY&amp;sig=H6m000aZeQIU8j6YvezXlN5ejbQ&amp;hl=en#PPA113,M1 The Human Tradition in Modern Brazil By Peter M. Beattie: Pages 112-113]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless it had appeal with the military class as [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] joined the group before breaking with it because he deemed Mendes and Lemos as too fanatical. [[Cândido Rondon]]'s conversion proved more solid as he remained an orthodox Positivist and a member of the faith long after the church's importance waned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vDHZJ433ficC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22positivist+church%22+brazil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hQ8nhytmgT&amp;sig=v_-4WrrWtbHDmHF1tmoDnd1xNj0&amp;hl=en#PPA84,M1 Stringing Together a Nation: Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and the... By Todd A. Diacon: pgs 83-84]&lt;/ref&gt; Although declined, the church still survives in Brazil. The national [[flag of Brazil]] bears the "Ordem e Progresso" ("Order and Progress"), inspired by Comte's motto of positivism: "L’amour pour principe et l’ordre pour base; le progrès pour but" ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal").&lt;ref name="historianet"&gt;[http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=934 Bandeiras e significados] Historianet.

== Other examples ==
There are more examples of Religion of Humanity started by positivists, and there are several authors who have given the epithet to the religion they support, whatever the religion. In India [[Baba Faqir Chand]] established [[Manavta Mandir]] (Temple of Humanity) to spread his religion of humanity with scientific attitude as explained by [[David C. Lane]] in a book ''The Unknowing Sage''. Comte influenced the thought of Victorian secularists [[George Holyoake]] (coiner of the term "[[secularism]]") and [[Richard Congreve]].

{{short description|theme in fiction and legends}}
{{broader|Rotating locomotion in living systems}}
[[Legend]]s and [[speculative fiction]] reveal a longstanding human fascination with [[Rotating locomotion in living systems|rolling and wheeled creatures]]. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia,{{r|Full93}} and in numerous modern works.

==Rolling creatures==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}}

[[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s 1825 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having "the shape of a star or wheel".{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} The 1863 edition of this book featured an illustration by [[Louis Le Breton]], depicting a creature with five legs radially arranged.{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

[[Neil R. Jones]]' 1937 story "On the Planet Fragment" featured aliens dubbed the Disci, which were shaped like wheels with limbs around the circumference. One of their methods of locomotion was a "rolling motion like that of a cartwheel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?87356|title=Internet Speculative Fiction Database entry for "On the Planet Fragment"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1944 science fiction short story "[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]", by [[Fredric Brown]], features a telepathic alien called an Outsider, which is roughly spherical and moves by rolling.{{r|Brown}} The story was the basis for a 1967 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode of the [[Arena (Star Trek)|same name]], and possibly also a 1964 episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled [[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|"Fun and Games"]], though neither television treatment included a spherical creature.{{r|arena}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] invented a creature that was capable of rolling itself forward, which he named ''Pedalternorotandomovens centroculatus articulosus''. He illustrated this creature in his 1951 lithograph {{lang|nl|[[Curl-up|Wentelteefje]]}} (also known by the English title ''Curl-up'').{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Escher}}

A 1956 [[Scrooge McDuck]] comic, ''[[Land Beneath the Ground!]]'', by [[Carl Barks]], introduced Terries and Fermies (a play on the phrase ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]''), creatures who move from place to place by rolling. The Terries and Fermies have made a sport of their rolling abilities, causing earthquakes in the process.{{r|coa1}}{{r|coa2}}

Northern Irish author [[James White (author)|James White]]'s [[Sector General]] series features "Rollers" from the planet Drambo, doughnut-shaped aquatic organisms that do not have [[heart]]s, but which instead must roll continuously to maintain [[Circulatory system|circulation]] by means of gravity.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|Louie}} The Rollers are described in the short story "Spacebird" in the 1980 edition of ''[[Ambulance Ship]]'', and in other works in the series.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|"Final_Diagnosis"}}{{r|"Double_Contact"}}

In ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]'' (1983) by [[Steve Jackson (British game designer)|Steve Jackson]], the reader may encounter Wheelies, disc-shaped creatures with four arms who move by doing [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]].&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=Neil|title=Fighting Fantasy Reviewed - The Citadel of Chaos|url=https://rpggeek.com/thread/488700/fighting-fantasy-reviewed-citadel-chaos|website=RPGGeek|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Steve|title=The Citadel of Chaos|date=1983|isbn=978-1-84831-076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', a 1986 science fiction novel by [[George R. R. Martin]], features an alien called a Rolleram, described as a "berserk living cannonball of enormous size", which kills its prey by rolling over it and crushing it, before digesting it externally. Adults of the species weigh approximately six metric tons and can roll faster than {{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr=off}}.{{r|martin}}

In the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991, the eponymous [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and his sidekick [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] move by rolling.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

The 1995 short story "Microbe", by [[Kenyon College]] biologist and [[feminist science fiction]] writer [[Joan Slonczewski]], describes an exploratory expedition to an alien world whose plant and animal life consists entirely of [[torus|doughnut-shaped]] organisms.{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}}

==Wheeled creatures==
Toy animals with wheels dating from the [[Pre-Columbian era]] were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

[[File:Wheeler Ozma of Oz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=L. Frank Baum's "Wheeler"|A "Wheeler" in L. Frank Baum's ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (Illustration by [[John R. Neill]])]]
{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
[[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}}  Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}} They also make an appearance in the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', based partly on  ''Ozma of Oz''.

The 1968 novel ''[[The Goblin Reservation]]'' by [[Clifford D. Simak]] features an intelligent alien race that uses biological wheels.{{r|Simak}}

''[[Chorlton and the Wheelies]]'', a British [[stop motion|stop-motion]]-animated television series that aired from 1976 to 1979, was set in "Wheelie World", which was inhabited by three-wheeled creatures called "wheelies".{{r|Toonhound}}

[[Piers Anthony]]'s 1977 book ''[[Cluster (novels)|Cluster]]'' and its sequels feature aliens called Polarians, which locomote by gripping and balancing atop a large ball. The ball is a living, though temporarily separable, portion of the Polarian's body.{{r|anthony}}

[[David Brin]]'s [[Uplift Universe|''Uplift'' Universe]] includes a wheeled species called the g'Kek, which are described in some detail in the 1995 novel ''[[Brightness Reef]]''.{{r|Brin95}} In 1996's ''[[Infinity's Shore]]'', a g'Kek is described as looking like "a squid in a wheelchair." The g'Kek suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles in their old age, particularly when living in a [[gravitational biology|high gravity environment]].{{r|Brin95}}{{r|Brin96}}

A 1997 novel in the ''[[Animorphs]]'' series, ''[[The Andalite Chronicles]]'', includes an alien called a Mortron, composed of two separate entities: a yellow and black bottom half with four wheels, and a red, elongated head with razor-sharp teeth and concealed wings.{{r|Applegate}}

The 2000 novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', by English author [[Philip Pullman]], features an alien race known as the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]], which have diamond-shaped bodies with one leg at the front and back and one on each side. The Mulefa use large, disk-shaped seed pods as wheels. They mount the pods on bone axles on their front and back legs, while propelling themselves with their side legs. The Mulefa have a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with the seed pod trees, which depend on the rolling action to crack open the pods and allow the seeds to [[Seed dispersal|disperse]].{{r|Pullman}}

In the 2000 novel [[Wheelers (novel)|''Wheelers'']], by English mathematician [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and reproductive biologist [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]] species called "blimps" has developed the ability to biologically produce machines called "wheelers", which use wheels for locomotion.{{r|Stewart}}{{r|kirkus}}

The children's television series ''[[Jungle Junction]]'', which premiered in 2009, features hybrid jungle animals with wheels rather than legs;{{r|BBC-Jungle}} one such animal, Ellyvan, is a hybrid of an [[elephant]] and a [[van]].{{r|junglejunction}} These animals traverse their habitat on elevated [[highway]]s.{{r|disney}}

'''Seriousness''' (noun; adjective: '''''serious''''') is an attitude of [[gravitas|gravity]], [[:wikt:solemnity|solemnity]], persistence, and [[:wikt:earnest|earnest]]ness toward something considered to be of [[importance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Seriousness ''Seriousness'', The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable philosophers and commentators have criticised excessive seriousness, while others have praised it.&lt;ref name=PSB&gt;''The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings'', Perry Miller, Thomas Herbert Johnson, p. 59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fBB7uGjYoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=puritanism+seriousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qzRHytADSW&amp;sig=RG6-211MUe3bFbUmGHR_HD8WSMY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0OVZTeObI4P2tgO11-WoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=serious&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''"Spirit of Seriousness"'', The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness'', Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;''Joseph Adler on Seriousness'', Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you- thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;''"High Seriousness"'', ''Historicism Once More: Problems and Occasions for the American Scholar'', NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1971), pp. 283–286, Roy Harvey Pearce, George Levine, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1345129]&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness is often contrasted with [[comedy]], as in the [[seriocomedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;''Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, SAMMY and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz'', The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D.

Sometimes fields studying degrees of seriousness overlap, such as developmental psychology studies of development of the sense of degrees of seriousness as it relates to transgressions, which has overlap with criminology and the seriousness of crimes.

== Philosophical attitudes toward seriousness ==

=== Praise for "high seriousness" in scholarship and poetry ===
Some use "seriousness" as a term of praise for scholarship or in literary review.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; 19th century [[poet]], [[cultural critic]], and [[literary critic]], [[Matthew Arnold]] said that the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were "high truth" and "high seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Pater, Wilde, and the Object as in Themselves They See It, Wendell V. Harris, Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900, Vol. 11, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1971), pp. 733–747&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical disdain for seriousness ===
Many have expressed an attitude of disdain toward taking things too seriously, as opposed to viewing things with an attitude of humor. Poet, playwright, and philosopher [[Joseph Addison]] said that being serious is dull, "we are growing serious, and let me tell you, that's the next step to being dull."&lt;ref name= JA/&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you-thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt; Political satirist [[P.J. O'Rourke]] said that "Seriousness is stupidity sent to college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotationsbook.com/quote/35911/ ''P. J. O'Rourke on Seriousness'', Quotations Book]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigram]]ist, poet, and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] said that "life is too important to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary-quotes.com/life-is-too-important-to-be-taken-seriously-oscar-wilde/ ''Seriously Oscar Wild", Dictionary of Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; In a play on words, novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] indicated that the ''central serious conviction in life'' is that nothing should be taken with too much seriousness, "the one serious conviction that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famous-quotes.com/topic.php?tid=1109 ''Samuel Butler on Seriousness'', Book of Famous Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[ascetic]] or [[puritan]] religious sects, an attitude of seriousness is always to be taken, and [[solemnity]], [[sobriety]], and puritanism with its hostility to social pleasures and indulgences are the only acceptable attitudes. [[Perry Miller]], "the master of American intellectual history", wrote of excessive seriousness of the [[Puritan]]s, "simple humanity cries at last for some relief from the interminable high seriousness of the Puritan code."&lt;ref name=PSB/&gt;

==== The "spirit of seriousness" in existential philosophy ====
{{Further|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
[[Existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] called the "spirit of seriousness’’ the belief that there is an objective and independent goodness in things for people to discover, and that this belief leads to [[bad faith]]. He argued that people forget that values are not absolute, but are contingent and subjectively determined.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; In Sartre’s words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] ‘'[[:wikt:given|given]]s’’,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of ‘desirable’ from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

== Seriousness and comedy ==
{{Further|Seriocomedy}}
Seriousness is sometimes contrasted with the [[comedy|comical]] in [[humor]]. In the [[performing arts]] and [[literature]], the [[seriocomedy]] is a [[genre]] which blends seriousness with the comical, [[drama]] with [[comedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz, The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D. Chaston, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v025/25.1chaston01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Comedy: The Development of Modern Comic Tragedy'', J. L. Styan, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=w1DNaVCV2YgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=seriousness+comedy&amp;ots=Mzl7_hDgkX&amp;sig=wIco2kXThh47fgLYqg2vzSBNVv0#v=onepage&amp;q=seriousness%20comedy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and detection ==

=== Detecting presence and absence of seriousness in humor ===
{{Further|Theory of humor}}
In the [[theory of humor]], one must have a [[sense of humor]] and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point.&lt;ref name=SRF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''When Congress makes a joke: Congressional Humor as Serious and Purposeful Communication'', International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 359–394, Nov 2004, Dean L. Yarwood&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information.&lt;ref name=NSIH&gt;''Negotiating the Serious Import of Humor'', Sociometry, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), pp. 169–181, Joan P. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, [[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]] in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.&lt;ref name=NSIH/&gt;

=== Detecting degree of seriousness in developmental psychology ===
{{Further|Educational psychology}}
In [[Developmental psychology]] and [[educational psychology]], seriousness is studied as it relates to how children develop an ability to distinguish levels of seriousness as it relates to transgressions and expenditure of time; for example, a child must learn to distinguish between levels of seriousness in admonitions such as between "don't fidget" and "don't forget to look both ways when crossing the street", which have the same linguistic and normative structure, but different levels of seriousness.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;''"regarding the seriousness... their ability to understand the reality-fantasy distinction"'', ''Preschoolers' Moral Judgments: Distinctions Between Realistic and Cartoon-Fantasy Transgressions'', Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Interaction design and children: building a community, 2004, Kristen M. Peters, Fran C. Blumberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring degree of seriousness in crime ===
{{Further|Punishment|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
The degree of seriousness of crimes is an important factor relating to crime. One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high seriousness", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.

In [[criminal law]] the degree of seriousness is considered when meting out punishment to fit the crime, and in considering to what extent overcrowded prison facilities will be used.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness of a crime is a major factor in considerations of the allocation of scarce [[law enforcement]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and measurement of seriousness is a major concern in [[public policy]] considerations.  A quantitative scoring system called the "seriousness score" has been developed for use in allocating law enforcement resources and sentencing.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

As to England and Wales, see section 143 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

=== Medical triage ===
Degrees of seriousness are used in medicine to make decisions about care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the [[triage]] nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care. Seriousness of illness is used to make decisions as to whether to perform invasive procedures such as surgery.

==== Measuring crime seriousness in the media ====
There is a [[positive correlation]] between the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

=== Cultural variation in measurement and detection ===
What is considered serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[criminology]]; being of the wrong religious faith may be considered a serious crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a serious crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality a serious crime in some cultures; and prostitution is a serious crime in some cultures.&lt;ref name=CRCC/&gt; Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Risk Perception: An Evaluation of the Psychometric Paradigm in Risk Perception Research'', Lennart Sjöberg, Bjørg-Elin Moen, Torbjørn Rundmo, [http://www.paul-hadrien.info/backup/LSE/IS%20490/Sjoberg%20Psychometric_paradigm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual and reproductive health and rights''' or ''SRHR'' is an  of [[human rights]] applied to [[sexuality]] and [[reproduction]]. It is a combination of four fields that in some contexts are more or less distinct from each other, but less so or not at all in other contexts. These four fields are [[sexual health]], [[Universal Declaration of Sexual Rights|sexual rights]], [[reproductive health]] and [[reproductive rights]]. In the concept of SRHR, these four fields are treated as separate but inherently intertwined.

Distinctions between these four fields are not always made. Sexual health and reproductive health are sometimes treated as synonymous to each other, as are sexual rights and reproductive rights. In some cases, sexual rights are included in the term sexual health, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ippf.org/resource/IPPF-Charter-Sexual-and-Reproductive-Rights|title=IPPF Charter on Sexual and Reproductive Rights Guidelines | date = 22 November 2011 | publisher= IPPF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do different [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) and governments{{cn|date=May 2018}} use different terminologies, but different terminologies are often used within the same organization.

Some of the notable global NGOs that fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights include [[International Planned Parenthood Federation|IPPF]] (International Planned Parenthood Federation), [[ILGA]] (International Lesbian and Gay Alliance), WAS ([[World Association for Sexual Health]] - formerly known as World Association for Sexology), and International HIV/AIDS Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131206105333/http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-date = 6 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | title = SRHR and HIV | publisher = International HIV/AIDS Alliance | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616041715/http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-date = 16 June 2011 | dead-url = yes | title = Members of EuroNGOs | publisher = EuroNGOs | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual health==
The [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/sexual_health/en/|title=Sexual health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines sexual health as: "Sexual health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."

==Sexual rights==
Unlike the other three aspects of SRHR, the struggle for sexual rights include, and focus on, sexual pleasure and emotional sexual expression. One platform for this struggle is the [[World Association for Sexual Health|WAS]] Declaration of Sexual Rights.

The Platform for Action from the [[1995 Beijing Conference on Women]] established that human rights include the right of women freely and without coercion, violence or discrimination, to have control over and make decisions concerning their own sexuality, including their own sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ | title = Beijing Platform for Action, paragraphs 92, 93 and 96 | publisher = United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women | date = September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph has been interpreted by some countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sweden's international policy on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights" | url = http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | website = www.regeringen.se | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001157/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | archivedate = 2014-05-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the applicable definition of women’s sexual rights. The UN Commission on Human Rights has established that if women had more power, their ability to protect themselves against violence would be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/84: The protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-84.doc | date = 21 April 2005 | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 20 April 2005 | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/41: Elimination of violence against women | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-41.doc | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th World Congress of Sexology (Hong Kong, 1999), the WAS adopted the [[Declaration of Sexual Rights]], which originally included 11 sexual rights. It was heavily revised and expanded in March 2014 by the WAS Advisory Council to include 16 sexual rights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsexology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/declaration_of_sexual_rights_sep03_2014.pdf |title=Declaration of sexual rights' |publisher=Worldsexology.org |date=2014-03-01 |access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The right to equality and non-discrimination
# The right to life, liberty and security of the person
# The right to autonomy and bodily integrity
# The right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
# The right to be free from all forms of violence and coercion
# The right to privacy

# The right to access to justice, remedies, and redress

This Declaration influenced [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] (which were launched as a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity on 26 March 2007), especially on the idea of each person's [[integrity]], and right to sexual and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yogyakartaprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/A5_yogyakartaWEB-2.pdf | title = The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | work = Yogyakartaprinciples.org | date = 10 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the U.S. government said it would begin using the term "sexual rights" in discussions of human rights and global development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-government-says-it-will-now-use-the-term-sexual-rights/ar-AAer3sZ?li=AAa0dzB&amp;ocid=HPCDHP |title=US government says it will now use the term 'sexual rights' |publisher=Msn.com |date=2015-06-26 |access-date=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive health==
{{Main article|Reproductive health}}
Within the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be [[sex education|informed]] of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of [[birth control]]; also access to appropriate [[reproductive medicine|health care services]] of [[sexual medicine|sexual]], [[reproductive medicine]] and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of [[maternal health|women to go safely]] through [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. On the other hand, individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall KS, Moreau C, Trussell J | title = Determinants of and disparities in reproductive health service use among adolescent and young adult women in the United States, 2002-2008 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–67 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22390451 | pmc = 3483992 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive Rights==
{{Main article|Reproductive rights}}
'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="Cook_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Rebecca J. | last2 = Fathalla | first2 = Mahmoud F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives | date = September 1996 | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 115 | doi = 10.2307/2950752 | jstor = 2950752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html|title=Sexual and reproductive health | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Goals and objectives ==
Despite frequent changes to frameworks, overall goals for SRHR remain little changed. As first stipulated at the ICPD, universal reproductive health care remains the ultimate objective, and with each new framework, targets are developed to progress towards this.&lt;ref name="Tangcharoensathien_2015" /&gt; In the original ICPD Program of Action, the primary call was for universal access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, family planning and sexual health.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt; Over time, these have expanded to include the right to access education regarding sexual and reproductive health, an end to [[female genital mutilation]], and increased women's empowerment in social, political, and cultural spheres.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt;

Special goals and targets were also created to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs. Adolescents are often the most vulnerable to risks associated with sexual activity, including HIV, due to personal and social issues such as feelings of isolation, child marriage, and stigmatization.&lt;ref name="Hindin_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindin MJ, Fatusi AO | title = Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in developing countries: an overview of trends and interventions | journal = International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 58–62 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19620089 | doi = 10.1363/ipsrh.35.058.09 | jstor = 40233805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments realized the importance of investing in the health of adolescents as a means of establishing future well-being for their societies.&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra-Mouli V, Svanemyr J, Amin A, Fogstad H, Say L, Girard F, Temmerman M | title = Twenty years after International Conference on Population and Development: where are we with adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights? | language = English | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 56 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S1-6 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25528975 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Commission on Population and Development]] developed a series of fundamental rights for adolescents including the right to comprehensive sex education, the right to decide all matters related to their sexuality, and access to sexual and reproductive health services without discrimination (including safe abortions wherever legal).&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015" /&gt;

==Family and personal life==
Aamer was born on 21 December 1966 and grew up in [[Medina]] in Saudi Arabia. He left the country at the age of 17. He lived and traveled in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=independent1/&gt; Aamer lived and studied in Georgia and Maryland in 1989 and 1990. During the [[Gulf War]], he worked as a translator for the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/11-years-in-guantanamo-without-trial-or-charges/|title = 11 years in Guantanamo without trial or charges|author = Phil Hirschkorn|date = March 31, 2013|access-date = November 1, 2015|publisher = [[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to the United Kingdom in 1996 where he met Zin Siddique, a British woman; they married in 1997 and he established legal [[residency (domicile)|residency]] in Britain. They have four British children, the youngest of whom Aamer had never met, due to his having been born after Aamer's imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Bbc050208&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4245517.stm "Calls to free Guantanamo father"], [[BBC]], 8 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Aamer had indefinite leave to remain in the UK, and was applying for British citizenship.&lt;ref name=grauniad/&gt;

Aamer worked as an Arabic translator for [[London]] law firms. Some of the solicitors he worked for dealt with [[immigration]] cases. In his spare time, Aamer helped refugees find accommodation and offered them advice on their struggles with the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/shaker-aamer-guantanamos-last-british-detainee-1914791.html|title=Shaker Aamer: Guantanamo's last British detainee|work=The Independent|date=3 March 2010|accessdate=5 January 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Aamer's family lived in [[Battersea]], South London. His wife Zin Aamer suffered from [[Mood disorder|depression]] and mental episodes since his arrest.&lt;ref name="independent2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent5Jan2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wandsworthnews/9446170.Ten_years_in_custody_without_charge_for_Shaker_Aamer/|title=Ten years in custody without charge for Battersea's Shaker Aamer|work=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed Siddique, Aamer's father-in-law, said in 2011, "When he was captured, Shaker offered to let my daughter divorce him, but she said, 'No, I will wait for you.' She is still waiting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cahalan, Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/obamas-uturn-on-guantanamo-seals-fate-of-lone-briton-6283796.html |title=Obama's U-turn on Guantanamo seals fate of lone Briton |work=The Independent|location=UK|date=1 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and allegations==
[[File:Abdul Shaker with Children.jpg|240px|right|thumb|

Aamer took his family to Afghanistan in 2001, where he was working for an Islamic charity when the U.S. invaded the country later that year.&lt;ref name="Bbc050208"/&gt; The [[Northern Alliance]] took him into custody in [[Jalalabad]] in December 2001, and passed him to the Americans. The US routinely paid ransom for Arabs handed over to them.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; They interrogated Aamer at [[Bagram Theater Internment Facility]] and transported him to Guantánamo on 14 February 2002.

According to [[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] assessments from 1 November 2007, the US military believed that Aamer was a "recruiter, financier, and facilitator" for [[al-Qaeda]], based partly on spurious evidence given by the informant [[Yasim Muhammed Basardah]], a fellow detainee.&lt;ref name=20110503cahalan/&gt; The leaked documents alleged that Aamer had confessed to interrogators that he was in [[Tora Bora]] with Osama bin Laden at the time of the US bombing.&lt;ref name="eluded-US-during-10-year-manhunt"/&gt; The documents further note that the Saudi intelligence [[Mabahith]] identified Aamer "as a high priority for the government of Saudi Arabia, an indication of his law enforcement value to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leigh|first1=David|last2=Cobain|first2=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-shaker-aamer-british|title=Guantánamo Bay files: Shaker Aamer, inmate from Britain the US won't let go|date=24 April 2011|work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Guantanamo Review Task Force]] released their report of the detainee assessments. In many instances, the Task Force largely agreed with prior [[threat assessment]]s of the detainees and sometimes found additional information that further substantiated such assessments. In other instances, the Task Force found prior assessments to be overstated. Some assessments, for example, contained allegations that were not supported by the underlying source document upon which they relied. Other assessments contained conclusions that were stated categorically even though derived from uncorroborated statements or raw intelligence reporting of undetermined or questionable reliability. Conversely, in a few cases, the Task Force discovered reliable information indicating that a detainee posed a greater threat in some respects than prior assessments suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/ag/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf#page=13 Guantanamo Review Task Force Final Report], (p.&amp;nbsp;9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamer denies being involved in terrorist activity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/last-brit-guantanamo-shaker-aamer-diagnosed-post-traumatic-stress-1443869|title=Last Brit in Guantanamo Shaker Aamer Diagnosed With Post Traumatic Stress|work=International Business Times UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attorney, Clive Stafford Smith of [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], said the evidence against his client "would not stand up in court." He pointed out that part of the evidence comes from [[Yasim Muhammed Basardah]], whom American judges found to be "utterly incredible" and who was tortured and "promised all sorts of things."&lt;ref name=20110503cahalan/&gt;

The Bush administration acknowledged later that it had no evidence against Aamer, and he was cleared for transfer in 2007.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheScotsman9Jan2012/&gt;  The clearance was for transfer to Saudi Arabia only.&lt;ref name="GuardianTownsend20130420"/&gt;

==Aamer's allegations of being tortured in Bagram ==
In September 2009, [[Zachary Philip Katznelson|Zachary Katznelson]], a Reprieve lawyer, said that Aamer had told of suffering severe beatings at the Bagram facility. Aamer said that close to a dozen men had beaten him, including interrogators who represented themselves as officers of [[MI5]], the United Kingdom's internal counter-terrorism agency. Following one severe beating, he recovered from being stunned to find that all the interrogators had left the room and put a pistol on the table.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06/&gt; He did not determine if the pistol was loaded. He said it occurred to him that it had been left either so he could kill himself, or that, if he picked it up, he could be shot and killed on the excuse he was trying to shoot them.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06/&gt;

Aamer says that the "MI5" interrogators told him he had two choices: (1) agree to spy on suspected jihadists in the United Kingdom; or (2) remain in US custody.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2009-09-06&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/06/guantanamo-gun-abuse-cia-mi5|title='MI5 agent left me alone with gun', says Guantánamo terror detainee|date=6 September 2009|author=Doward, Jamie|work=The Guardian|location=London|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fworld%2F2009%2Fsep%2F06%2Fguantanamo-gun-abuse-cia-mi5&amp;date=2009-09-06|archivedate=6 September 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that guards/agents repeatedly knocked his head against the wall while an MI5 officer was in the room.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All I know is that I felt someone grab my head and start beating my head into the back wall – so hard that my head was bouncing. And they were shouting that they would kill me or I would die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2086747/Last-Briton-Guantanamo-Bay-says-MI5-officer-room-tortured.html#ixzz1jkFsoxkn|location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=Robert|last=Verkaik|title=Last Briton in Guantanamo Bay says MI5 officer was in room as he was tortured|date=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Guantanamo==
Aamer has been described as an unofficial [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the detainees at Guantanamo. He has spoken up for the welfare of prisoners, negotiating with camp commanders and organizing protests against cruel treatment. He organized and participated in a [[Guantánamo Bay hunger strikes|hunger strike in 2005]] in which he lost half of his weight. He demanded the prisoners be treated according to the [[Geneva Convention]], allowing the detainees to form a grievance committee. In negotiations, the camp administration promised a healthier diet for the prisoners after he agreed to end the hunger strike.&lt;ref name=independent1/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent20070914/&gt; His lawyer Stafford Smith said the grievance committee was formed, but that the camp authorities disbanded it after a few days. American spokesmen Major Jeffrey Weir denied that the Americans had ever agreed to any conditions resulting from the hunger strike.

In September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison. They argued extended periods of isolation were detrimental to his mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=Spectacle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectacle.co.uk/projects_page.php?id=486|title=Updates - Shaker Aamer|work=Spectacle|location=UK|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamer continued to take part in additional hunger strikes and was held in solitary confinement for most of the time. His lawyers described his solitary confinement as "cruel" and said his health was affected to a point where they feared for his life. In 2011 Stafford Smith, director of the UK branch of Reprieve, said Aamer is "falling apart at the seams."&lt;ref name="morningstaronline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependentJan2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Carol |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/12/24/2560773/secret-guantanamo-cell-block-cost.html |title=Secret Guantánamo cell block cost nearly $700,000 – Guantánamo |work=Miami Herald |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2006, Aamer's attorneys filed a 16-page motion arguing for his removal from isolation in Guantanamo Bay prison.&lt;ref name=Cnn060918&gt;

The next day Katznelson filed a motion to enforce the Geneva Conventions on his behalf.&lt;ref name=Habeas04cv2215-2006-09-19&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After President [[Barack Obama]] was elected, in 2009 he convened a six-agency task force to review the status of detainees at Guantanamo. It "unanimously recommended" transfer of Aamer.&lt;ref name="nytOct15"/&gt; Security officials wanted to send him to Saudi Arabia, his country of citizenship, but his attorneys argued for him to be transferred to Great Britain, where he had been resident and had family.&lt;ref name="nytOct15"&gt;Charles Savage and Steven Erlanger, "Guantánamo Release Ends Yearslong Battle", ''New York Times'', 31 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Aamer's lawyer Brent Mickum, who saw him in Guantánamo, alleges that Aamer was repeatedly beaten before their meetings. He said that Aamer's mental and physical health is deteriorating. "It felt like he has given up: that's what 10 years, mostly in solitary confinement will do to a person," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/last-briton-in-guantanamo-on-hunger-strike |title=Last Briton in Guantanamo on hunger strike |publisher=Channel 4 News |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Binyam Mohamed]], an Ethiopian prisoner who formerly occupied a cell one door down from Aamer, has said since his release that he knows why Aamer is still in the prison camps.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say the Americans are trying to keep him as silent as they could. It's not that he has anything. What happened in 2005 and 2006 is something that the Americans don't want the world to know – hunger strikes, and all the events that took place, until the three brothers who died ... insider information of all the events, probably. Obviously, Shaker doesn't have it, but the Americans think he may have some of it, and they don't like this kind of information being released.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clive Stafford Smith, his lawyer and director of human rights organisation Reprieve, came to a similar conclusion. He said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/wandsworthnews/5001740._Heartbreaking__moment_Shaker_Aamer_saw_first_photo_of_son/ |title='Heartbreaking' moment Shaker Aamer saw first photo of son |work=Your Local Guardian |date=11 February 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have known Shaker for some time, because he is so eloquent and outspoken about the injustices of Guantanamo he is very definitely viewed as a threat by the US. Not in the sense of being an extremist but in the sense of being someone who can rather eloquently criticise the nightmare that happened there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Omar Deghayes]], a former Guantanamo Detainee who knew Aamer, said of him,

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was always forward, he would translate for people, he'd fight for them, and if he had any problems in the block he'd shout at the guards... until he would get you your rights. And that's why he's still in prison... because he's very outspoken, a very intelligent person, somebody who would fight for somebody else's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectacle.co.uk/projects_page.php?id=485 |title='Spectacle Shaker Aamer |work= Spectacle |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===At Camp "No" on June 2006===
{{main|Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations}}
In an article published in 2010, Aamer said that he was beaten for hours and subjected to interrogation methods that included [[asphyxiation]] on 9 June 2006, the same day that [[Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations|three fellow prisoners died in Guantanamo]]. The United States claimed these deaths were suicides.&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;

Describing his treatment, Aamer said that he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. When MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body: his temples, just under his jawline, in the hollow beneath his ears. They bent his nose repeatedly, pinched his thighs and feet. They inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he screamed and then they cut off his airway and put a mask over him, so he could not cry out.&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18&gt;

The law professor [[Scott Horton (attorney)|Scott Horton]] published an award-winning article on the 2006 deaths in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in 2010, suggesting that these were cases of homicide caused by extended torture, rather than suicide. He said that Aamer had been brought to "[[Camp No, Guantanamo|Camp No]]," a secret interrogation [[black site]] outside the camp, with the three men who died on the day of the event. Horton described Aamer's account of having his airways cut off as "alarming" and wrote, "This is the same technique that appears to have been used on the three deceased prisoners."&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-01-18/&gt; Colonel [[Michael Bumgarner]], the commander of the camps during the incident and identified in Horton's article as having been present during the interrogations, denied Horton's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2010/01/hbc-90006395 |title=The Official Response Begins| author=Horton, Scott |work=Harpers Magazine |date=18 May 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horton wrote that Aamer's repatriation was being delayed so that he could not testify about his alleged torture in [[Bagram]] or the events on 9 June 2006. He wrote: "American authorities may be concerned that Aamer, if released, could provide evidence against them in criminal investigations."&lt;ref name=Harpers2010-01-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2010-01-18/&gt;

=== 2013 hunger strike and detention condition ===

In 2013, Aamer told his attorneys that he was among the growing group of active hunger strikers. He said he had been refusing meals since February 15 and had lost 32 pounds.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; In previous hunger strikes guards [[force-fed]] him with tubes down his nose.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; His lawyer said Aamer spent 22 hours a day alone in his cell.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Aamer was not permitted visitors except his attorneys.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; Aamer was among a group of detainees who filed a court challenge to the authorities' practice of force feeding those on hunger strikes. A United States appellate court ruled in 2014 "that the judiciary could oversee conditions of confinement at the prison."&lt;ref name="nytOct15"/&gt;

=== 2014 motion for release ===
In 2014, his lawyers filed a motion on Aamer's behalf seeking his release on the grounds that his health is "gravely diminished,". They argued that his various health problems could not be treated in Guantanamo and "''even if he receives the intensive medical and therapeutic treatment his condition requires, Mr Aamer will take many years, if not a lifetime, to achieve any significant recovery". His lawyers argued that both the [[Geneva Convention]] and Army Regulation 190-8, require the repatriation of chronically ill prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26933512|title=Bid to free last British resident held at Guantanamo|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/08/guantanamo-bay-british-detainee-shaker-aamer-ptsd-release|title=Guantánamo Bay: last British resident suffering from PTSD, lawyers say|author=Jon Swaine|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/04/last-former-english-resident-in-guantanamo-bay-requests-release-on-declining-health.php|title=JURIST - Guantanamo detainee requests release on declining health|work=jurist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 despite Aamer's deteriorating health, the US denied attorneys' request for an independent medical examination.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt;

==UK release negotiations==
The United Kingdom government initially refused to intervene on the behalf of Guantánamo detainees who were legal British residents but were not British [[Citizenship|citizens]].  In August 2007, Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] requested the release of Aamer and four other men, based on their having been granted refugee status, or similar leave, to remain in Britain as residents prior to their capture by US forces.&lt;ref name="Bbc050208"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheIndependent20070914&gt;

The UK government officials repeatedly raised Aamer's case with the Americans.  On a visit to the United States on 13 March 2009, when asked about Guantánamo captives, [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] said that the US administration has said they do not want to return Aamer to the UK. [[William Hague]], the Foreign Secretary, raised Aamer's case again with [[Hillary Clinton]], US Secretary of State, in November 2010,&lt;ref name="TortSet"&gt;{{cite news|last=Verkaik |first=Robert |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/torture-settlement-brings-hope-to-last-british-inmate-in-guantanamo-2138111.html |title=Torture settlement brings hope to last British inmate in Guantanamo |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=19 November 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by meetings with other US officials.

* On July 4, 2015 (US Independence Day), 80 prominent Britons including six former cabinet ministers, leading writers, actors, directors, and musicians urged Obama to free Aamer.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

== Release ==
On 30 October 2015, Aamer was flown from Cuba, stepping on British soil at 13.00 GMT. In a later interview he discussed his detention and family life. He also called upon jihadis to "get the hell out" of Britain, stating that civilian killings were "not allowed" in Islam, and went on to say that "you cannot just go in the street and get a knife and start stabbing people" in apparent reference to the [[murder of Lee Rigby]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/shaker-aamer-attacks-extremism-guantanamo-release

==Introduction==
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg. When this is done, the cytoplasmic factors affect the nucleus to become a zygote. The blastocyst stage is developed by the egg which helps to create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic cell nuclear transfer {{!}} biology and technology|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/somatic-cell-nuclear-transfer|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=27 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first animal that was developed by this technique was Dolly, the sheep, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer - Embryology|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Somatic_Cell_Nuclear_Transfer|website=embryology.med.unsw.edu.au|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, known as the ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to the cells of the human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an denucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum.&lt;ref name="Pattinson"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|last2=Kind|first2=Vanessa|date=2017-09-12|title=Using a moot to develop students’ understanding of human cloning and statutory interpretation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0968533217726350|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|doi=10.1177/0968533217726350}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is [[Reprogramming|reprogrammed]] by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a [[blastocyst]] (an early stage [[embryo]] with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Applications==

=== Stem cell research ===
Somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in [[stem cell research]]. The aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo. These cells [[Genetics|genetically]] matched the donor organism from which they came. This gives them the ability to create patient specific pluripotent cells, which could then be used in therapies or disease research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo. These cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism. This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type, which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable human embryos. Leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells, SCNT is one such method.

A potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient's particular disease. By doing so, an ''in vitro'' model could be created, would be useful for studying that particular disease, potentially discovering its pathophysiology, and discovering therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a person with [[Parkinson's disease]] donated his or her somatic cells, the stem cells resulting from SCNT would have genes that contribute to Parkinson's disease. The disease specific stem cell lines could then be studied in order to better understand the condition.&lt;ref name=Semb&gt;{{cite journal |author=Semb H |title=Human embryonic stem cells: origin, properties and applications |journal=APMIS |volume=113 |issue=11–12 |pages=743–50 |year=2005 |pmid=16480446 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0463.2005.apm_312.x |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/search/ws/files/2775505/625333.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a [[South Korea]]n research team led by Professor [[Hwang Woo-suk]], published claims to have derived stem cell lines via SCNT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hwang WS, Roh SI, Lee BC, etal |title=Patient-specific embryonic stem cells derived from human SCNT blastocysts |journal=Science |volume=308 |issue=5729 |pages=1777–83 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15905366 |doi=10.1126/science.1112286 |url=}}{{Retracted paper|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but supported those claims with fabricated data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kennedy D |title=Editorial retraction |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5759 |pages=335 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16410485 |doi=10.1126/science.1124926 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent evidence has proved that he in fact created a stem cell line from a [[Parthenogenesis|parthenote]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/reports/theniche/2007/06/hwangs_clone_was_really_a_part_2.html], Nature Stem Cell Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/53290/], The Scientist 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals, questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum. Despite many attempts, success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited. There lies a problem in the human cell's ability to form a blastocyst; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development. This is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development. These earlier experiments used procedures developed in non-primate animals with little success.

A research group from the [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] demonstrated SCNT procedures developed for primates successfully   using skin cells. The key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase II (MII) of the cell cycle. Egg cells in MII contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states. When the ovum's nucleus is removed, the cell loses its genetic information. This has been blamed for why enucleated eggs are hampered in their reprogramming ability. It is theorized the critical embryonic genes are physically linked to oocyte chromosomes, enucleation negatively affects these factors. Another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast, affecting reprogramming ability.

Taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human SCNT stem cells. In May 2013, the Oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through SCNT, using fetal and infant donor cells. Using MII oocytes from volunteers and their improved SCNT procedure, human clone embryos were successfully produced. These embryos were of poor quality, lacking a substantial inner cell mass and poorly constructed [[trophectoderm]]. The imperfect embryos prevented the acquisition of human ESC. The addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum's nucleus and injection of the somatic nucleus improved blastocyst formation and ESC isolation. The ESC obtain were found to be capable of producing teratomas, expressed pluripotent transcription factors, and expressed a normal 46XX karyotype, indicating these SCNT were in fact ESC-like.&lt;ref name="Tachibana"/&gt; This was the first instance of successfully using SCNT to reprogram human somatic cells. This study used fetal and infantile somatic cells to produce their ESC.

In April 2014, an international research team expanded on this break through. There remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells. Epigenetic and age related changes were thought to possibly hinder an adult somatic cells ability to be reprogrammed. Implementing the procedure pioneered by the Oregon research group they indeed were able to grow stem cells generated by SCNT using adult cells from two donors, aged 35 and 75.Indicating age does not impede a cells ability to be reprogrammed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909%2814%2900137-4 Human Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Using Adult Cells] ''[[Cell Stem Cell]]''.

Late April 2014, the [[New York Stem Cell Foundation]] was successful in creating SCNT stem cells derived from adult somatic cells. One of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic. The group was then able to successfully culture these stem cells and induce differentiation. When injected into mice, cells of all three of the germ layers successfully formed. The most significant of these cells, were those who expressed insulin and were capable of secreting the hormone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The impetus for SCNT-based stem cell research has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cells]] were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based stem cell research: the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases.&lt;ref name="2008 breakthrough"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gretchen Vogel|title=Breakthrough of the year: Reprogramming Cells|journal=Science |volume=322|issue=5909|pages=1766–1767|date=December 2008|doi=10.1126/science.322.5909.1766|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/322/5909/1766 |pmid=19095902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells. Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into. For instance, an iPS cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells, while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Reproductive cloning ===
{{main|Cloning}}
[[File:ECM 2001 Hybridoma System.jpg|62 KBpx|thumbnail|BTX ECM 2001 Electrofusion generator used for SCNT and Cloning applications]]
This technique is currently the basis for [[cloning]] animals (such as the famous [[Dolly the sheep]]),&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been theoretically proposed as a possible way to clone humans. Using SCNT in reproductive cloning has proven difficult with limited success. High fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient. Resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species. For these reasons, along with moral and ethical objections, reproductive cloning in humans is proscribed in more than 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most researchers believe that in the foreseeable future it will not be possible to use the current cloning technique to produce a human clone that will develop to term. It remains a possibility, though critical adjustments will be required to overcome current limitations during early embryonic development in human SCNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Revel M |title=Research on animal cloning technologies and their implications in medical ethics: an update |journal=Med Law |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=527–43 |year=2000 |pmid=11143888 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rhind SM, Taylor JE, De Sousa PA, King TJ, McGarry M, Wilmut I |title=Human cloning: can it be made safe? |journal=Nat.

There is also the potential for treating diseases associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Recent studies show SCNT of the nucleus of a body cell afflicted with one of these diseases into a healthy oocyte prevents the inheritance of the mitochondrial disease. This treatment does not involve cloning but would produce a child with three genetic parents. A father providing a sperm cell, one mother providing the egg nucleus and another mother providing the enucleated egg cell.&lt;ref name="Pera" /&gt;

=== Interspecies nuclear transfer ===
Interspecies nuclear transfer (iSCNT) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species, or even to restore species after their extinction. The technique is similar to SCNT [[cloning]] which typically is between domestic animals and rodents, or where there is a ready supply of oocytes and surrogate animals. However, the cloning of highly endangered or extinct species requires the use of an alternative method of cloning. Interspecies nuclear transfer utilizes a host and a donor of two different organisms that are closely related species and within the same genus. In 2000, [[Robert Lanza]] was able to produce a cloned fetus of a [[gaur]], ''Bos gaurus'', combining it successfully with a domestic cow, ''Bos taurus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lanza|first=Robert P.|author2=Jose B. Cibelli |author3=Francisca A. Diaz |author4=Carlos T. Moraes |author5=Peter W. Farin |author6=Charlotte E. Farin |author7=Carolyn J. Hammer |author8=Michael D. West |author9=Philip Damiani  |title=Cloning of an endangered species (Bos gaurus) using interspecies nuclear transfer|journal=Cloning|year=2000|volume=2|issue=2|pages=79–90|url=http://media.longnow.org/files/2/REVIVE/Cloning%20of%20an%20Endangered%20Species.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2013|doi=10.1089/152045500436104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interspecies nuclear transfer provides evidence of the universality of the triggering mechanism of the cell nucleus reprogramming. For example, Gupta et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Das | first2 = Z. C. | last3 = Heo | first3 = Y. T. | last4 = Uhm | first4 = S.

Moreover, NCSU23 medium, which was designed for in vitro culture of pig embryos, was able to support the in vitro development of cattle, mice, and chicken iSCNT embryos up to the [[blastocyst]] stage. Furthermore, ovine oocyte cytoplast may be used for remodeling and reprogramming of human somatic cells back to the embryonic stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hosseini | first1 = S.

==Limitations==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
SCNT can be inefficient. Stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus in early research were enormous, resulting in a low percentage of successfully reprogrammed cells. For example, in 1996 Dolly the sheep was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; As the procedure was not automated, but had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive. The [[biochemistry]] involved in reprogramming the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from understood. However, by 2014, researchers were reporting success rates of 70-80% with cloning pigs&lt;ref&gt;Shukman, David (14 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25576718 China cloning on an 'industrial scale'] BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 a Korean company, Sooam Biotech, was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos a day.&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=New Scientist|date=8 February  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's [[mitochondria]] that contain their own [[mitochondrial DNA]] are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. This fact may also hamper the potential benefits of SCNT derived tissues/organs for therapy, as there may be an immunoresponse to the non-self mtDNA after transplant.

== Controversy ==
{{Further|stem cell controversy}}

[[Image:Human blastocyst.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Human [[Blastocyst]], showing the [[inner cell mass]] (top, right).]]
Proposals to use nucleus transfer techniques in human stem cell research raise a set of concerns beyond the moral status of any created embryo. These have led to some individuals and organizations who are ''not'' opposed to human embryonic stem cell research to be concerned about, or opposed to, SCNT research.&lt;ref name="rifkin"&gt;[[Jeremy Rifkin]]. (February 18, 2002). [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020218/rifkin "Fusion Biopolitics".] ''The Nation''. Retrieved on August 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg"&gt;Sheryl Gay Stolberg, "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE7DA1E3BF937A15752C0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Some for Abortion Rights Lean Right in Cloning Fight]", ''New York Times'' (January 24, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lori B. Andrews, et al., [http://geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=1958 Open Letter to US Senate on Human Cloning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122105524/http://geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=1958 |date=2010-11-22 }}, (March 19, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

One concern is that blastula creation in SCNT-based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction,&lt;ref name="Regulation"&gt;Lori B. Andrews et al. (March 19, 2002).[http://genetics-and-society.org/resources/cgs/2002_open_letter.html "Open Letter to US Senators on Human Cloning and Eugenic Engineering".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930074200/http://www.genetics-and-society.org/resources/cgs/2002_open_letter.html |date=2006-09-30 }} Retrieved on August 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or its prohibition.&lt;ref name="rifkin" /&gt;

A second important concern is the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human [[ovum|eggs]], which can only be obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].

One vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients. Each custom stem cell line would consist of a collection of identical stem cells each carrying the patient's own DNA, thus reducing or eliminating any problems with rejection when the stem cells were transplanted for treatment. For example, to treat a man with Parkinson's disease, a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by SCNT into an egg cell from an egg donor, creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient's own cells. (There would be differences. For example, the mitochondrial DNA would be the same as that of the egg donor. In comparison, his own cells would carry the mitochondrial DNA of his mother.)

Potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy, and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line.  Such large numbers of donated eggs would exceed the number of eggs currently left over and available from couples trying to have children through [[assisted reproductive technology]]. Therefore, healthy young women would need to be induced to sell eggs to be used in the creation of custom stem cell lines that could then be purchased by the medical industry and sold to patients. It is so far unclear where all these eggs would come from.

Stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyperovulation (ovulating several eggs at once). Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now, the long-term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use on a large scale on otherwise healthy women. Longer-term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later. Whether hormone treatments to induce hyperovulation could have similar effects is unknown. There are also ethical questions surrounding paying for eggs. In general, marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries. Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time.

To address the problem of creating a human egg market, some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs. If successful, human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines.  However, this technology may be a long way off.

== Policies regarding human SCNT ==
SCNT involving human cells is currently legal for research purposes in the [[United Kingdom]], having been incorporated into the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]].&lt;ref name="coghlan"&gt;Andy Coghlan, "[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1602 Cloning opponents fear loopholes in new UK law]", ''New Scientist'' (November 23, 2001, retrieved October 6, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pattinson"/&gt; Permission must be obtained from the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] in order to perform or attempt SCNT.

In the United States, the practice remains legal, as it has not been addressed by federal law.&lt;ref name="NBAC"&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/research/nrcbl/nbac/pubs/cloning1/chapter5.pdf "Chapter 5: Legal and Policy Considerations.

Accessed 21 Oct 06&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 2002, a moratorium on United States federal funding for SCNT prohibits funding the practice for the purposes of research.  Thus, though legal, SCNT cannot be federally funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robertson | first1 = John A | year = 2010 | title = Embryo Stem Cell Research: Ten Years of Controversy | url = | journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine, &amp; Ethics | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 191–203 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2010.00479.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; American scholars have recently argued that because the product of SCNT is a clone embryo, rather than a human embryo, these policies are morally wrong and should be revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cunningham | first1 = Thomas V | year = 2013 | title = What justifies the United States ban on federal funding for nonreproductive cloning? | url = | journal = Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 825–841 | doi=10.1007/s11019-013-9465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[United Nations]] adopted a proposal submitted by [[Costa Rica]], calling on member states to "prohibit all forms of human cloning in as much as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life."&lt;ref name="un"&gt;United Nations, "[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/ga10333.doc.htm General Assembly Adopts United Nations Declaration on Human Cloning By Vote of 84-34-37]", press release (August 3, 2005, retrieved October 6, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase may include SCNT, depending on interpretation.

The [[Council of Europe|Council of Europe's]] ''Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine'' and its ''Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being'' appear to ban SCNT of human beings.

'''Terror management theory''' ('''TMT''') is an [[evolutionary psychology]] theory originally proposed by [[Jeff Greenberg]], [[Sheldon Solomon]], and [[Tom Pyszczynski]]&lt;ref name=GPS/&gt; and codified in their book ''The Worm at the Core: On the Role of Death in Life'' (2015). It proposes that a basic psychological conflict results from having a [[self-preservation]] instinct whilst realizing that death is inevitable and to some extent unpredictable. This conflict produces terror, and the terror is then managed by embracing cultural values, or symbolic systems that act to provide life with enduring meaning and value.&lt;ref name="GPS"&gt;Greenberg, J., Pyszczynski, T. &amp; Solomon, S. (1986). "The causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem: A terror management theory". In R.F. Baumeister (ed.), ''Public Self and Private Self'' (pp. 189-212). Springer-Verlag (New York).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GPS91"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = S. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | year = 1991 | title = A terror management theory of social behavior: The psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews | url = | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 93| page = 159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Examples of cultural values that impact an individual's terror of death are those that purport to offer literal immortality (e.g. belief in afterlife, religion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jonas | first1 = E. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Terror management and religion: evidence that intrinsic religiousness mitigates worldview defense following mortality salience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 553–567 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.3.553 | pmid=16938037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, TMT also argues that other cultural values&amp;nbsp;– including those that are seemingly unrelated to death&amp;nbsp;– offer symbolic immortality.  For example, values of national identity,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; posterity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhou | first1 = X. | last2 = Liu | first2 = J. | last3 = Chen | first3 = C. | last4 = Yu | first4 = Z. | year = 2008 | title = Do children transcend death?

L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = J.

L. 2000"/&gt; have  been linked to death concerns.  In many cases these values are thought to offer symbolic immortality either a) by providing the sense that one is part of something greater that will ultimately outlive the individual (e.g. country, lineage, species), or b) by making one's symbolic identity superior to biological nature (i.e. you are a personality, which makes you more than a glob of cells).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Because cultural values determine that which is meaningful, they are also the foundation for [[self-esteem]]. TMT describes self-esteem as being the personal, subjective measure of how well an individual is living up to their cultural values.&lt;ref name=GPS91/&gt;

TMT is derived from [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ernest Becker]]'s 1973&amp;nbsp;[[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning work of nonfiction ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', in which Becker argues most human action is taken to ignore or avoid the inevitability of death. The terror of absolute annihilation creates such a profound&amp;nbsp;– albeit subconscious&amp;nbsp;– anxiety in people that they spend their lives attempting to make sense of it. On large scales, societies build symbols: laws, [[religion and happiness|religious meaning systems]], cultures, and belief systems to explain the significance of life, define what makes certain characteristics, skills, and talents extraordinary, reward others whom they find exemplify certain attributes, and punish or kill others who do not adhere to their cultural [[worldview]]. On an individual level, self-esteem provides a buffer against death-related anxiety.

==Background==

}}

[[Cultural anthropology|Cultural anthropologist]] Ernest Becker asserted in his 1973&amp;nbsp;book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'' that humans, as intelligent animals, are able to grasp the inevitability of death. They therefore spend their lives building and believing in cultural elements that illustrate how to make themselves stand out as individuals and give their lives significance and meaning. Death creates an anxiety in humans; it strikes at unexpected and random moments, and its nature is essentially unknowable, causing people to spend most of their time and energy to explain, forestall, and avoid it.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, pp. ix–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker expounded upon the previous writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Norman&amp;nbsp;O.&amp;nbsp;Brown]], and [[Otto Rank]]. According to clinical psychiatrist [[Morton Levitt]], Becker replaces the Freudian preoccupation with [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the fear of death as the primary motivation in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Morton (July 1974). "Reviewed work(s): The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 414, USA-USSR: Agenda for Communication, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

People desire to think of themselves as beings of value and worth with a feeling of permanence, a concept in [[psychology]] known as [[self-esteem]]. This feeling counters the [[cognitive dissonance]] created by an individual's realization that they may be no more important than any other living thing. Becker refers to high self-esteem as heroism: {{blockquote|the problem of heroics is the central one of human life, that it goes deeper into human nature than anything else because it is based on organismic [[narcissism]] and on the child's need for self-esteem as ''the'' condition for his life. Society itself is a codified hero system, which means that society everywhere is a living myth of the significance of human life, a defiant creation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rationale behind decisions regarding one's own health can be explored through a terror management model. A 2008 research article in [[Psychological Review]] proposes a three-part model for understanding how awareness of death can ironically subvert health-promoting behaviors by redirecting one's focus towards behaviors that build self-esteem instead: "''Proposition 1 suggests that conscious thoughts about death can instigate health-oriented responses aimed at removing death-related thoughts from current focal attention. Proposition 2 suggests that the unconscious resonance of death-related cognition promotes self-oriented defenses directed toward maintaining, not one's health, but a sense of meaning and self-esteem. The last proposition suggests that confrontations with the physical body may undermine symbolic defenses and thus present a previously unrecognized barrier to health promotion activities.''"&lt;ref name=model&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Arndt | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = The Implications of death for health: A terror management health model for behavioral health promotion | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 115 | issue = 4| pages = 1032–1053 | doi=10.1037/a0013326| pmid = 18954213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary backdrop===
Terror management theorists consider TMT to be compatible with the [[theory of evolution]]:&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; Valid fears of dangerous things have an adaptive function that helped facilitate the survival of our ancestors' genes. However, generalized existential anxiety resulting from the clash between a desire for life and awareness of the inevitability of death is neither adaptive nor selected for. TMT views existential anxiety as an unfortunate byproduct of these two highly adaptive human proclivities rather than as an adaptation that the evolutionary process selected for its advantages. Just as human [[bipedalism]] confers advantages as well as disadvantages, death anxiety is an inevitable part of our intelligence and awareness of dangers.

Anxiety in response to the inevitability of death threatened to undermine adaptive functioning and therefore needed amelioration. TMT posits that humankind used the same intellectual capacities that gave rise to this problem to fashion cultural beliefs and values that provided protection against this potential anxiety. TMT considers these cultural beliefs (even unpleasant and frightening ones, such as ritual human sacrifice) when they manage potential [[death anxiety (psychology)|death anxiety]] in a way that promotes beliefs and behaviors which facilitated the functioning and survival of the collective.

Hunter-gatherers used their emerging cognitive abilities to facilitate solving practical problems, such as basic needs for nutrition, mating, and tool-making. As these abilities evolved, an explicit awareness of death also emerged. But once this awareness materialized, the potential for terror that it created put pressure on emerging conceptions of reality. Any conceptual formation that was to be widely accepted by the group needed to provide a means of managing this terror.

Originally, the emergence of morality evolved to facilitate co-existence within groups. Together with language, morality served pragmatic functions that extended survival. The struggle to deny the finality of death co-opted and changed the function of these cultural inventions. For example, [[Neanderthal]]s might have begun burying their dead as a means of avoiding unpleasant odors, disease-infested parasites, or dangerous scavengers. But during the Upper Paleolithic era, these pragmatic burial practices appear to have become imbued with layers of ritual performance and supernatural beliefs, suggested by the elaborate decoration of bodies with thousands of beads or other markers. Food and other necessities were also included within the burial chamber, indicating the potential for a belief system that included life after death. In many human cultures today, [[funeral]]s are viewed primarily as cultural events, viewed through the lens of morality and language, with little thought given to the utilitarian origins of burying the dead.

Evolutionary history also indicates that "the costs of ignoring threats have outweighed the costs of ignoring opportunities for self-development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook Of Experimental Existential Psychology|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_KMRe9wK2MC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=2013-08-18|chapter=Paradise Lost and Reclaimed|last1=Koole|first1=Sander L.|last2=van den Berg|first2=Agnes E.|editor1-last=Greenberg|editor1-first=Jeff|editor2-last=Koole|editor2-first=Sander L.|editor3-last=Pyszczynski|editor3-first=Tom|year=2004|publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59385-040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the concept that abstract needs for individual and group self-esteem may continue to be selected for by evolution, even when they sometimes confer risks to physical health and well-being.

==Self-esteem==
[[Self-esteem]] lies at the heart of TMT and is a fundamental aspect of its core paradigms. TMT fundamentally seeks to elucidate the causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem. Theoretically, it draws heavily from [[Ernest Becker]]'s conceptions of culture and self-esteem (Becker, 1971;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Ernest (1971). The birth and death of meaning (2nd ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker, 1973&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Ernest (1973). ''The Denial of Death'' (1st ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). TMT not only attempts to explain the concept of self-esteem, it also tries to explain ''why'' we need self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self-esteem"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., Solomon, S., Arndt, J. &amp; Schimel, J.
 | year = 2004
 | title = Why do people need self-esteem? A theoretical and empirical review
 | journal = Psychological Bulletin | number=130 | pages=435–468 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.435
 | pmid = 15122930
 | volume=130
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation is that self-esteem is used as a coping mechanism for anxiety. It helps people control their sense of terror and nullify the realization that humans are just animals trying to manage the world around them. According to TMT, self-esteem is a sense of personal value that is created by beliefs in the validity of one's cultural worldview, and the belief that one is living up to the cultural standards created by that worldview.&lt;ref name = "self-esteem"/&gt;

Critically, Hewstone ''et al.'' (2002) have questioned the causal direction between self-esteem and death-anxiety, evaluating whether one's self-esteem comes from their desire to reduce their death anxiety, or if death anxiety arises from a lack of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=Hew&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hewstone | first1 = M. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = M. | last3 = Willis | first3 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Intergroup bias | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 575–604 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109 | pmid = 11752497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an individual's suppression of death anxiety may arise from their overall need to increase their self-esteem in a positive manner.&lt;ref name="Hew"/&gt;

Research has demonstrated that self-esteem can play an important role in physical health. In some cases, people may be so concerned with their physical appearance and boosting their self-esteem that they ignore problems or concerns with their own physical health.&lt;ref name=arndt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arndt | first1 = J. | last2 = Cox | first2 = C. R. | last3 = Goldenberg | first3 = J. L. | last4 = Vess | first4 = M. | last5 = Routledge | first5 = C. | last6 = Cooper | first6 = D. P. | last7 = Cohen | first7 = F. | year = 2009 | title = Blowing in the (social) wind: Implications of extrinsic esteem contingencies for terror management and health | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 96 | issue = 6| pages = 1191–1205 | doi = 10.1037/a0015182 | pmid=19469596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arndt ''et al.'' (2009) conducted three studies to examine how peer perceptions and social acceptance of smokers contributes to their quitting, as well as if, and why these people continue smoking for outside reasons, even when faced with thoughts of death and anti-smoking prompts.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt; Tanning and exercising were also looked at in the researchers' studies. The studies found that people are influenced by the situations around them.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt;  Specifically, Arndt ''et al.'' (2009) found in terms of their self-esteem and health, that participants who saw someone exercising were more likely to increase their intentions to exercise.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt; In addition, the researchers found in study two that how participants reacted to an anti-smoking commercial was affected by their motivation for smoking and the situation which they were in. For instance, people who smoked for extrinsic reasons and were previously prompted with death reminders were more likely to be compelled by the anti-smoking message.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt;

===Self-esteem as anxiety buffer===
An individual's level of self-consciousness can affect their views on life and death. To a point, increasing self-consciousness is adaptive in that it helps prevent awareness of danger. However, research has demonstrated that there may be [[diminishing returns]] from this phenomenon. Individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness sometimes have increased death cognition, and a more negative outlook on life, than those with reduced self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=anxiety&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taubman-Ben-Ari | first1 = O. | last2 = Noy | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Self-consciousness and death cognitions from a terror management perspective | url = | journal = Death Studies | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 871–892 | doi = 10.1080/07481187.2010.496685 | pmid = 24482853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, self-esteem can work in the opposite manner. Research has confirmed that individuals with higher self-esteem, particularly in regard to their behavior, have a more positive attitude towards their life. Specifically, death cognition in the form of anti-smoking warnings weren't effective for smokers and in fact, increased their already positive attitudes towards the behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = J. | last2 = Winzeler | first2 = S. | last3 = Topolinski | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = When the death makes you smoke: A terror management perspective on the effectiveness of cigarette on-pack warnings | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 226–228 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2009.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons behind individuals' optimistic attitudes towards smoking after mortality was made salient, indicate that people use positivity as a buffer against anxiety. Continuing to hold certain beliefs even after they are shown to be flawed creates [[cognitive dissonance]] regarding current information and past behavior, and the way to alleviate this is to simply reject new information. Therefore, anxiety buffers such as self-esteem allow individuals to cope with their fears more easily. Death cognition may in fact cause [[negative reinforcement]] that leads people to further engage in dangerous behaviors (smoking in this instance) because accepting the new information would lead to a loss of self-esteem, increasing vulnerability and awareness of mortality.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

==Mortality salience==
The [[mortality salience]] hypothesis&amp;nbsp;(MS) states that if indeed one's cultural worldview, or one's self-esteem, serves a death-denying function, then threatening these constructs should produce defenses aimed at restoring psychological equanimity (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;returning the individual to a state of feeling invulnerable). In the MS&amp;nbsp;paradigm, these "threats" are simply experiential reminders of one's own death. This can, and has, taken many different forms in a variety of study paradigms (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;asking participants to write about their own death;&lt;ref name=GPS/&gt; conducting the experiment near funeral homes or cemeteries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Wicklund | first2 = R. A. | last3 = Floresku | first3 = S. | last4 = Koch | first4 = H. | last5 = Gauch | first5 = G. | last6 = Solomon | first6 = S. | last7 = Greenberg | first7 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Whistling in the dark: Exaggerated consensus estimates in response to incidental reminders of mortality | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 332–336 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00384.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; having participants watch graphic depictions of death,&lt;ref name = "Green 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = J. | last2 = Pyszczynski | first2 = T. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Simon | first4 = L. | last5 = Breus | first5 = M. | year = 1994 | title = Role of consciousness and accessibility of death-related thoughts in mortality salience effects | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 4| pages = 627–637 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). Like the other TMT hypotheses, the literature supporting the MS hypothesis is vast and diverse. For a meta analysis of MS&amp;nbsp;research, see Burke ''et al.'' (2010).&lt;ref name = Burke&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burke | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Martens | first2 = A. | last3 = Faucher | first3 = E. H. | year = 2010 | title = Two decades of terror management theory: A meta-analysis of mortality salience research | url = | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 155–195 | doi=10.1177/1088868309352321 | pmid=20097885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimentally, the MS&amp;nbsp;hypothesis has been tested in close to 200&amp;nbsp;empirical articles.&lt;ref name = Burke/&gt; After participants in an experiment are asked to write about their own death (vs.&amp;nbsp;a neutral, non-death control topic, such as dental pain), and then following a brief delay (distal, worldview/self-esteem defenses work the best after a delay; see Greenberg ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name="Green 1994"/&gt; for a discussion), the participants' defenses are measured. In one early TMT study assessing the MS&amp;nbsp;hypothesis, Greenberg ''et al.'' (1990)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = J. | last2 = Pyszczynski | first2 = T. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Rosenblatt | first4 = A. | last5 = Veeder | first5 = M. | last6 = Kirkland | first6 = S. | last7 = Lyon | first7 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Evidence for terror management&amp;nbsp;II: The effects of mortality salience on reactions to those who threaten or bolster the cultural worldview | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 308–318 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.2.308| citeseerx = 10.1.1.454.2378 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had Christian participants evaluate other Christian and Jewish students that were similar demographically, but differed in their religious affiliation. After being reminded of their death (experimental MS&amp;nbsp;induction), Christian participants evaluated fellow Christians more positively, and Jewish participants more negatively, relative to the control condition.&lt;ref name=religion&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Simon | first2 = L. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Pyszczynski | first4 = T. | last5 = Solomon | first5 = S. | last6 = McGregor | first6 = H. | year = 1997 | title = Terror management theory and self-esteem: Evidence that increased self-esteem reduces mortality salience effects | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 24–36 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.24| pmid = 9008372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, bolstering self-esteem in these scenarios leads to less worldview defense and derogation of dissimilar others.&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt;

Mortality salience has an influence on individuals and their decisions regarding their health. Cox ''et al.'' (2009) discuss mortality salience in terms of suntanning. Specifically, the researchers found that participants who were prompted with the idea that pale was more socially attractive along with mortality reminders, tended to lean towards decisions that resulted in more protective measures from the sun.&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = D. P. | last3 = Vess | first3 = M. | last4 = Arndt | first4 = J. | last5 = Goldenberg | first5 = J. L. | last6 = Routledge | first6 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Bronze is beautiful but pale can be pretty: The effects of appearance standards and mortality salience on sun-tanning outcomes | url = | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 746–752 | doi = 10.1037/a0016388 | pmid = 19916643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were placed in two different conditions; one group of participants were given an article relating to the fear of death, while the control group received an article unrelated to death dealing with the fear of public speaking.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Additionally, they gave one group an article pertaining to the message that "bronze is beautiful," one relating to the idea that "pale is pretty," and one neutral article that did not speak of tan or pale skin tones.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Finally, after introducing a delay activity, the researchers gave the participants a five-item questionnaire asking them about their future sun-tanning behaviors. The study illustrated that when tan skin was associated with attractiveness, mortality salience positively affected people's intentions to suntan; however, when pale skin was associated with attractiveness people's intentions to tan decreased.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;

===Mortality and self-esteem on health risks===
Studies have shown that mortality and self-esteem are important factors of the terror management theory. Jessop ''et al.'' (2008) study this relationship within four studies that all examine how people react when they are given information on risks, specifically, in terms of the mortality related to the risks of driving.&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jessop | first1 = D. C. | last2 = Albery | first2 = I. P. | last3 = Rutter | first3 = J. | last4 = Garrod | first4 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Understanding the impact of mortality-related health-risk information: A terror management theory perspective | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 7| pages = 951–964 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208316790 | pmid = 18453389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the researchers were exploring how participants acted in terms of self-esteem, and its impact on how mortality-related health-risk information would be received.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Overall, Jessop ''et al.'' (2008) found that even when mortality is prominent, people who engage in certain behaviors to improve their self-esteem have a greater chance of continuing with these activities.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Mortality and self-esteem are both factors that influence people's behaviors and decision-making regarding their health. Furthermore, individuals who are involved in behaviors and possess motivation to enhance their self-worth are less likely to be affected by the importance placed on health risks, in terms of mortality.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Self-esteem is important when mortality is made salient. It can allow people a coping mechanism, one that can cushion individuals' fears; and thus, impacting one's attitudes towards a given behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Individuals who have higher levels of self-esteem regarding their behavior(s) are less likely to have their attitudes, and thus their behaviors changed regardless of mortality salient or death messages.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; People will use their self-esteem to hide behind their fears of dying. In terms of smoking behaviors, people with higher smoking-based self-esteem are less susceptible to anti-smoking messages that relate to death; therefore, mortality salience and death warnings afford them with an even more positive outlook on their behavior, or in this instance their smoking.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

In the Hansen ''et al.'' (2010) experiment the researchers manipulated mortality salience. In the experiment, Hansen ''et al.'' (2010) examined smokers' attitudes towards the behavior of smoking. Actual warning labels were utilized to create mortality salience in this specific experiment. The researchers first gave participants a questionnaire to measure their smoking-based self-esteem.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Following the questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to two different conditions; the first were given anti-smoking warning labels about death and the second, control group were exposed to anti-smoking warning labels not dealing with death.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Before the participants' attitudes towards smoking were taken the researchers introduced an unrelated question to provide a delay. Further research has demonstrated that delays allow mortality salience to emerge because thoughts of death become non-conscious.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Finally, participants were asked questions regarding their intended future smoking behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; However, one weakness in their conduction was that the final questionnaire addressed opinions and behavioral questions, as opposed to the participants level of persuasion regarding the different anti-smoking warning labels.

===Social impacts===
Many people are more motivated by social pressures, rather than health risks. Specifically for younger people, mortality salience is stronger in eliciting changes of one's behavior when it brings awareness to the immediate loss of social status or position, rather than a loss, such as death that one can not imagine and feels far off.&lt;ref name=social&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = I. M. | last2 = Kamins | first2 = M. A. | year = 2010 | title = An application of terror management theory in the design of social and health-related anti-smoking appeals | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Behaviour | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 172–190 | doi = 10.1002/cb.293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many different factors to take into consideration, such as how strongly an individual feels toward a decision, his or her level of self-esteem, and the situation around the individual. Particularly with people's smoking behaviors, self-esteem and mortality salience have different effects on individuals' decisions.  In terms of the longevity of their smoking decisions, it has been seen that individuals' smoking habits are affected, in the short-term sense, when they are exposed to mortality salience that interrelates with their own self-esteem.  Moreover, people who viewed social exclusion prompts were more likely to quit smoking in the long run than those who were simply shown health-effects of smoking.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; More specifically, it was demonstrated that when individuals had high levels of self-esteem they were more likely to quit smoking following the social pressure messages, rather than the health risk messages.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;  In this specific instance, terror management, and specifically mortality salience is showing how people are more motivated by the social pressures and consequences in their environment, rather than consequences relating to their health. This is mostly seen in young adult smokers with higher smoking-based self-esteems who are not thinking of their future health and the less-immediate effects of smoking on their health.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;

==Death thought accessibility==
Another paradigm that TMT&amp;nbsp;researchers use to get at unconscious concerns about death is what is known as the death thought accessibility&amp;nbsp;(DTA) hypothesis. Essentially, the DTA&amp;nbsp;hypothesis states that if individuals are motivated to avoid cognitions about death, and they avoid these cognitions by espousing a worldview or by buffering their self-esteem, then when threatened, an individual should possess more death-related cognitions (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;thoughts about death, and death-related stimuli) than they would when not threatened.&lt;ref name = "Hayes" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = J. | last2 = Schimel | first2 = J. | last3 = Ardnt | first3 = J. | last4 = Faucher | first4 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A Theoretical and Empirical Review of the Death Thought Accessibility Concept in Terror Management Research | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 136 | issue = 5| pages = 699–739 | doi=10.1037/a0020524 | pmid=20804234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DTA hypothesis has its origins in work by Greenberg ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name = "Green 1994"/&gt; as an extension of their earlier terror management hypotheses (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the anxiety buffer hypothesis and the mortality salience hypothesis). The researchers reasoned that if, as indicated by [[Daniel Wegner|Wegner's]] research on [[thought suppression]] (1994; 1997), thoughts that are purposely suppressed from conscious awareness are often brought back with ease, then following a delay death-thought cognitions should be more available to consciousness than (a)&amp;nbsp;those who keep the death-thoughts in their consciousness the whole time, and (b)&amp;nbsp;those who suppress the death-thoughts but are not provided a delay. That is precisely what they found. However, other psychologists have failed to replicate these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trafimow|first=David|author2=Jamie S. Hughes |title=Testing the Death Thought Suppression and Rebound Hypothesis|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=September 2012|volume=3|issue=5|pages=622–629|doi=10.1177/1948550611432938|url=http://spp.sagepub.com/content/3/5/622.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these initial studies (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;Greenberg ''et al.'' (2004); Arndt ''et al.'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arndt | first1 = J. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Solomon | first4 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Subliminal exposure to death-related stimuli increases defense of the cultural worldview | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 379–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00429.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in numerous subsequent DTA studies, the main measure of DTA is a word fragment task, whereby participants can complete word fragments in distinctly death-related ways (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;coff_&amp;nbsp;_ as coffin, not coffee) or in non death-related ways (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;sk_&amp;nbsp;_l as skill, not skull).&lt;ref name="TMHM"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = D. P. | last2 = Goldenberg | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Arndt | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Empowering the self: Using the terror management health model to promote breast self-examination | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 315–325 | doi = 10.1080/15298868.2010.52749 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If death-thoughts are indeed more available to consciousness, then it stands to reason that the word fragments should be completed in a way that is semantically related to death.

===Importance of the DTA hypothesis===

The introduction of this hypothesis has refined TMT, and led to new avenues of research that formerly could not be assessed due to the lack of an empirically validated way of measuring death-related cognitions. Also, the differentiation between proximal (conscious, near, and threat-focused) and distal (unconscious, distant, symbolic) defenses that have been derived from DTA studies have been extremely important in understanding how people deal with their terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | year = 1999 | title = A dual-process model of defense against conscious and unconscious death-related thoughts: An extension of terror management theory | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 835–845 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note how the DTA paradigm subtly alters, and expands, TMT as a motivational theory. Instead of solely manipulating mortality and witnessing its effects (e.g., [[nationalism]], increased prejudice, [[Safe sex|risky sexual behavior]], etc.), the DTA paradigm allows a measure of the death-related cognitions that result from various affronts to the self. Examples include threats to self-esteem and to one's worldview; the DTA paradigm can therefore assess the role of death-thoughts in self-esteem and worldview defenses. Furthermore, the DTA hypothesis lends support to TMT in that it corroborates its central hypothesis that death is uniquely problematic for human beings, and that it is fundamentally different in its effects than meaning threats, (i.e., Heine ''et al.'', 2006&lt;ref name = "Heine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Proulx | first2 = T. | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K. D. | year = 2006 | title = The meaning maintenance model: On the coherence of human motivations | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 88–110 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1002_1| pmid = 16768649 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.434.4237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and that is death itself, and not uncertainty and lack of control associated with death; Fritsche ''et al.'' (2008) explore this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritsche | first1 = I. | last2 = Jonas | first2 = E. | last3 = Fankhänel | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = The role of control motivation in mortality salience effects on ingroup support and defense | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 524–541 | doi=10.1037/a0012666 | pmid=18729692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the DTA hypothesis had been rapidly gaining ground in TMT investigations, and as of 2009, has been employed in over 60 published papers, with a total of more than 90 empirical studies.&lt;ref name = "Hayes"/&gt;

===Death anxiety on health promotion===

How people respond to their fears and anxiety of death is investigated in TMT. Moreover, Taubman-Ben-Ari and Noy (2010) examine the idea that a person's level of self-awareness and self-consciousness should be considered in relation to their responses to their anxiety and death cognitions.&lt;ref name="anxiety"/&gt; The more an individual is presented with their death or death cognitions in general, the more fear and anxiety one may have; therefore, to combat said anxiety one may implement anxiety buffers.&lt;ref name="anxiety"/&gt;

Due to a change in people's lifestyles, in the direction of more unhealthy behaviors, the leading causes of death now, being [[cancer]] and [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], most definitely are related to individuals' unhealthy behaviors (though the statement is over-generalising and certainly cannot be applied to every case)&lt;ref name="death anxiety"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bozo | first1 = Ö. | last2 = Tunca | first2 = A. | last3 = Şİmşek | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The effect of death anxiety and age on health- promoting behaviors: A terror-management theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied | volume = 143 | issue = 4| pages = 377–389 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.143.4.377-389 | pmid = 19606644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Age and death anxiety both are factors that should be considered in the terror management theory, in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Age undoubtedly plays some kind of role in people's health-promoting behaviors; however, an actual age related effect on death anxiety and health-promoting behaviors has yet to be seen. Although, research has demonstrated that for young adults only, when they were prompted with death related scenarios, they yielded more health-promoting behaviors, compared to those participants in their sixties. In addition, death anxiety has been found to have an effect for young adults, on their behaviors of health promotion.&lt;ref name="death anxiety"/&gt;

==Terror management health model==
The terror management health model (TMHM) explores the role that death plays on one's health and behavior. Goldenberg and Arndt (2008) state that the TMHM proposes the idea that death, despite its threatening nature, is in fact instrumental and purposeful in the conditioning of one's behavior towards the direction of a longer life.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt;

According to Goldenberg and Arndt (2008), certain health behaviors such as [[Breast self-examination|breast self-exam]]s (BSEs) can consciously activate and facilitate people to think of death, especially their own death.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt; While death can be instrumental for individuals, in some cases, when breast self-exams activate people's death thoughts an obstacle can present itself, in terms of health promotion, because of the experience of fear and threat.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt; Abel and Kruger (2009) have suggested that the stress caused by increased awareness of mortality when celebrating one's birthday might explain the [[birthday effect]], where mortality rates seem to spike around these days.&lt;ref name="MLB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, death and thoughts of death can serve as a way of empowering the self, not as threats. Researchers, Cooper ''et al.'' (2011) explored TMHM in terms of empowerment, specifically using BSEs under two conditions; when death thoughts were prompted, and when thoughts of death were non-conscious.&lt;ref name="TMHM"/&gt; According to TMHM, people's health decisions, when death thoughts are not conscious, should be based on their motivations to act appropriately, in terms of the self and identity.&lt;ref name="TMHM" /&gt; Cooper ''et al.'' (2011) found that when mortality and death thoughts were primed, women reported more empowerment feelings than those who were not prompted before performing a BSE.&lt;ref name="TMHM" /&gt;

Additionally, TMHM suggests that mortality awareness and self-esteem are important factors in individuals' decision making and behaviors relating to their health. TMHM explores how people will engage in behaviors, whether positive or negative, even with the heightened awareness of mortality, in the attempt to conform to society's expectations and improve their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; The TMHM is useful in understanding what motivates individuals regarding their health decisions and behaviors.

In terms of smoking behaviors and attitudes, the impact of warnings with death messages depends on:
# The individuals' level of smoking-based self-esteem
# The warnings' actual degree of death information&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

== Emotion ==
People with low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, have more negative emotions when reminded of death. This is believed to be because these individuals lack the very defenses that TMT argues protect people from mortality concerns (e.g., solid worldviews). In contrast, positive mood states are not impacted by death thoughts for people of low or high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Routledge|first=C. |author2=Ostafin, B. |author3=Juhl, J. |author4=Sedikides, C. |author5=Cathey, C.  |author6=Liao, J.|title=The effects of self-esteem and mortality salience on well-being, growth motivation, and maladaptive behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|pages=897–916|doi=10.1037/a0021431 |volume=99 |issue=6 |pmid=21114350|citeseerx=10.1.1.465.8476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
It has been suggested that culture provides  meaning, organization, and a coherent world view that diminishes the psychological terror caused by the knowledge of eventual death. The terror management theory can help to explain why a leader's popularity can grow substantially during times of crisis. When a follower's mortality is made prominent they will tend to show a strong preference for iconic leaders. An example of this occurred when [[George&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Bush]]'s [[United States presidential approval rating|approval rating]] jumped almost 50&amp;nbsp;percent following the [[September&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;attacks]] in the United States. As Forsyth (2009) posits, this tragedy made U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens aware of their mortality, and Bush provided an antidote to these existential concerns by promising to bring justice to the terrorist group responsible for the attacks.

Researchers Cohen ''et al.'' (2004), in their particular study on TMT, tested the preferences for different types of leaders, while reminding people of their mortality. Three different candidates were presented to participants. The three leaders were of three different types: task-oriented (emphasized setting goals, strategic planning, and structure), relationship-oriented (emphasized [[compassion]], trust, and confidence in others), and [[charisma]]tic. The participants were then placed in one of two conditions: mortality salient or control group. In the former condition the participants were asked to describe the emotions surrounding their own death, as well as the physical act of the death itself, whereas the [[control group]] were asked similar questions about an upcoming exam. The results of the study were that the charismatic leader was favored more, and the relationship-oriented leader was favored less, in the mortality-salient condition. Further research has shown that mortality salient individuals also prefer leaders who are members of the same group, as well as men rather than women (Hoyt ''et al.'' 2010). This has links to [[social role theory]].

==TMT and religion==
TMT posits that religion was created as a means for humans to cope with their own mortality. Supporting this, arguments in favor of life after death, and simply being religious, reduce the effects of mortality salience on worldview defense. Thoughts of death have also been found to increase religious beliefs. At an implicit, subconscious level, this is the case even for people who claim to be nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heflick |first=Nathan |author2=Goldenberg, J. |title=No atheists in foxholes: Arguments for (but not against) afterlives buffer mortality salience effects for atheists |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |year=2012| doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02058.x |pmid=21995319 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=385–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jong |first=Jonathan |author2=Halberstadt, Jamin |author3=Bluemke, Matthias |title=Foxhole atheism, revisited: The effects of mortality salience on explicit and implicit religious belief |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.005 |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |year=2012 |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=983–989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}

Bloom and Nancy Dess]&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar commented that the field of psychology would be advanced by a study of paralyzed states caused by anxiety that would only be alleviated with the reworking of a person's mental state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fessler/pubs/NavarreteNormativeBiasEP.pdf Normative Bias and Adaptive Challenges]&lt;/ref&gt; These authors instead explain human behavior is selected to urge people to avoid situations likely to lead to death. This suggests that mortality salience effects reflect adaptive responses to solve specific life-threats rather than an unconscious attempt to avoid this realization.

===Prevalence of death in TMT===
Since findings on mortality salience and worldview defense were first published, other researchers have claimed that the effects may have been obtained due to reasons other than death itself, such as anxiety, fear, or other aversive stimuli such as pain. Other studies have found effects similar to those that MS results in – for example, thinking about difficult personal choices to be made, being made to respond to open-ended questions regarding uncertainty, thinking about being robbed, thinking about being socially isolated, and being told that one's life lacks meaning.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Maxfield | first4 = M. | year = 2006 | title = On the unique psychological import of the human awareness of mortality: Theme and variations | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 328–356 | doi=10.1080/10478400701369542}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these cases exist, thoughts of death have since been compared to various aversive experimental controls, such as (but not limited to) thinking about: failure, writing a critical exam, public speaking with a considerable audience, being excluded, paralysis, dental pain, intense physical pain, etc.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

With regards to the studies that found similar effects, TMT theorists have argued that in the previously mentioned studies where death was not the subject thought about, the subjects would quite easily be related to death in an individual's mind due to "linguistic or experiential connection with mortality" (p.&amp;nbsp;332)&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; For example, being robbed invokes thoughts of violence and being unsafe in one's own home – many people have died trying to protect their property and family. A second possible explanation for these results involves the death-thought accessibility hypothesis: these threats somehow sabotage crucial anxiety-buffering aspects of an individual's worldview or self-esteem, which increases their DTA. For example, one study found increased DTA in response to thoughts of antagonistic relations with attachment figures.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Meaning maintenance model===
The meaning maintenance model (MMM) was initially introduced as a comprehensive motivational theory that claimed to subsume TMT, with alternative explanations for TMT findings. Essentially, it posits that people automatically give meaning to things, and when those meanings are somehow disrupted, it causes anxiety.&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt; In response, people concentrate on "meaning maintenance to reestablish their sense of symbolic unity" and that such "meaning maintenance often involves the compensatory reaffirmation of alternative meaning structures".&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt; These meanings, among other things, should "provide a basis for prediction and control of our...environments, help [one] to cope with tragedy and trauma...and the symbolic cheating of death via adherence to the enduring values that these cultures provide".&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt;

TMT theorists argue that MMM cannot describe why different sets of meaning are preferred for a symbol by different people, and that while they may exist, "different [(i.e., more concrete)] types of meaning have different psychological functions".&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; For example, MMM&amp;nbsp;theorists argue that all types of meaning are basically equal, and yet one could not compare the likelihood of defensive responses resulting from exposure to a deck of cards containing black hearts with something like the September&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;attacks.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists argue, essentially, that unless something is an important element of a person's anxiety-buffering worldview or self-esteem, it will not require broad meaning maintenance.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

In sum, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists believe that MMM cannot accurately claim to be an alternative to TMT because it does not seem to be able to explain the current breadth of TMT evidence.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; As an example, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists assert that mortality salience would not be a threat to meaning, since our eventual demise is a necessary condition of life. Therefore, it should not cause an individual to engage in general meaning maintenance. MMM also makes no attempt to explain why threatening meaning increases DTA.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Offensive defensiveness===
Some theorists have argued that it is not the idea of death and nonexistence that is unsettling to people, but the fact that uncertainty is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGregor | first1 = I. | last2 = Zanna | first2 = M. P. | last3 = Holmes | first3 = J. G. | last4 = Spencer | first4 = S. J. | year = 2001 | title = Compensatory conviction in the face of personal uncertainty: Going to extremes and being oneself | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = 3| pages = 472–488 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.3.472}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, these researchers posited that people defend themselves by altering their fear responses from uncertainty to an enthusiasm approach.&lt;ref name ="uniqueness of death"/&gt;  Other researchers argue for distinguishing fear of death from fear of dying and, therein, posit that ultimately the fear of death has more to do with some other fear (e.g., fear of pain) or reflects fear of the unknown.&lt;ref name="FOTU"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carleton|first1=R. Nicholas|title=Fear of the unknown: One fear to rule them all?|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=June 2016|volume=41|pages=5–21|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.03.011|pmid=27067453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMT theorists agree that uncertainty can be disconcerting in some cases and it may even result in defense responses, but note that they believe the inescapability of death and the possibility of its finality regarding one's existence is most unsettling. They ask, "'Would death be any less frightening if you knew for certain that it would come next Tuesday at 5:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., and that your hopes for an afterlife were illusory?'....Would you rather be certain that death is the end, or live with the uncertainty that it might not be?" They also note that people actually seek out some types of uncertainty, and that being uncertain is not always very unpleasant.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; In contrast, there is substantial evidence that, all things being equal, uncertainty and the unknown represent fundamental fears and are only experienced as pleasant when there is sufficient contextual certainty.&lt;ref name = "FOTU" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "IU_Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carleton|first1=R. Nicholas|title=Into the unknown: A review and synthesis of contemporary models involving uncertainty|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=April 2016|volume=39|pages=30–43|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.02.007|pmid=26945765}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a surprise involves uncertainty, but is only perceived as pleasant if there is sufficient certainty that the surprise will be pleasant.  Consider a box received on a birthday from a trusted family member as compared to the box received at the end of the film "[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]" (which contains a severed head).

Though TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists acknowledge that many responses to mortality salience involve greater approaches (zealousness) towards important worldviews, they also note examples of mortality salience which resulted in the opposite, which offensive defensiveness cannot account for: when negative features of a group to which participants belong were made salient, people actively distanced themselves from that group under&amp;nbsp;mortality salience.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Evolutionary psychology, coalitional psychology, and TMT===
Several critiques have been proposed against TMT from [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] – for reasons including that fear is an adaptive response in individuals' that has come about as a result of natural selection; without these adaptations human beings would have never been able to avoid maladaptive situations.&lt;ref name = "Landau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Solomon | first2 = S. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Greenberg | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On the compatibility of terror management theory and perspectives on human evolution | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 476–519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is unlikely that people would have psychological ways of slowing-down anxiety.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; In response, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists argue that this critique is mixing up fear related to immediate danger with anxiety related to thoughts of threats that will or may occur eventually.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; TMT is talking about the protection that self-esteem and cultural worldviews offer against the threat of unavoidable death in the ''future''. While anxiety may be adaptive in avoiding entering a dangerous place (e.g. because a predator may be waiting), this doesn't mean that anxiety must be adaptive in all cases.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; For a more comprehensive review of TMT and evolutionary psychology, see Landau ''et al.'', 2007.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; Similar evolutionary critiques have been raised by researchers exploring uncertainty and unknowns (see for reviews,&lt;ref name = "FOTU"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "IU_Review" /&gt;).

Coalitional psychology&amp;nbsp;(CP) is presented as another alternative to TMT, which proposes that there is an evolutionary tendency to seek safety in groups (coalitions) as a reaction to adaptive threats.&lt;ref name= "Nav"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navarrete | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Fessler | first2 = D.M.T. | year = 2005 | title = Normative bias and adaptive challenges: A relational approach to coalitional psychology and a critique of terror management theory | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 297–325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People already a part of coalitional groups seek to protect their membership by exhibiting their value to the group.&lt;ref name = "Nav"/&gt; TMT theorists answer by arguing that CP 1) cannot account for the fact that virtually all cultures have a supernatural dimension; 2) it does not explain why cultural worldview defense is symbolic, involving allegiance to both specific and general systems of abstract meaning unrelated to specific threats, rather than focused on the specific adaptive threats it supposedly evolved to deal with; 3) it dismisses TMT's dual process account of the underlying processes that generate MS effects without providing an alternative of any kind or attempting to account for the data relevant to this aspect of the TMT analysis and 4) the experiments testing hypotheses derived from CP do not provide compelling or unique support for CP, 5) it cannot account for a host of empirical findings supporting hypotheses derived from TMT that could never be deduced from CP.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.ku.edu/~mjlandau/docs/Landau_tmt%20and%20evol%20psych_EP%202007.pdf On the Compatibility of Terror Management Theory and Perspectives on Human Evolution&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Future Is Wild''''' is a British 2002 thirteen-part pseudo-[[documentary]] television [[miniseries]]. Based on research and interviews with several scientists, the miniseries shows how life could evolve in the future if humans were to disappear from the [[Earth]] altogether through [[extinction]]. The version broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] modified this premise, supposing instead that the human species had completely abandoned the Earth and had sent back probes to examine the progress of life on the planet as time progressed. The show styled itself after the format of a nature documentary. It is narrated by [[John de Lancie]] in the Discovery Channel version.

The miniseries was released with a companion book written by geologist [[Dougal Dixon]], the author of several [[speculative evolution]] books, or "anthropologies and zoologies of the future" (such as ''[[After Man: A Zoology of the Future]]''), in conjunction with [[natural history]] television producer John Adams. For a time in 2005, a theme park based on this program was opened in Japan. In 2008 a special on the Discovery Channel about the development of the video game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' was combined with airings of ''The Future Is Wild''.

A documentary film version of the series was originally set to be picked up by [[Warner Bros.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tezer|first=Adnan|title=Warner sees the 'Future'|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/news/article_1504724.php/Warner-sees-the-Future|work=Monsters and Critics|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=2 October 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the series may be rebooted by production company [[Vanguard Animation]] and broadcasting at [[HBO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2016/01/shrek-producer-reboot-evolution-show/532312/|title=Shrek producer to reboot evolution show/532312/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2-part 2005 series ''[[Extraterrestrial (TV documentary)|Extraterrestrial]]'' (also known as ''Alien Worlds'') takes a similar scientific approach to the creation of speculative ecologies and the depiction of their inhabitants. As the title suggests, however, these are set on [[extrasolar planets]] with no connection to terrestrial evolution.

==Ecosystems==
Twelve ecosystems were presented, four in each of the three future periods.

===5 million years' time===
The early episodes describe a world after an [[ice age]], when giant sea-birds roam the beaches and carnivorous bats rule the skies. Ice sheets extend as far south as [[Paris]] in the northern hemisphere and as far north as [[Buenos Aires]] in the southern hemisphere. The [[Amazon rainforest]] has dried up and become [[grassland]]. The North American plains have become cold desert, and Africa has collided with Europe, enclosing the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Without water to replace it in the dry climate, the Mediterranean has dried out into a salt flat dotted with brine lakes, as it [[Messinian salinity crisis|has been in the past]]. Most of Europe is frozen [[tundra]]. The part of Africa east of the [[African Rift Valley]] has broken away from the rest of the continent. Asia has dried up and is now mountainous. The once warm, tropical area of Central America has been transformed into a dry area. Australia has moved north and collided with eastern [[Indonesia]].

;Profiled species

*[[Ephydridae|Brine flies]], flies that thrive on [[hypersaline]] water; the very same species alive today.
;Hypothesized species

*Babookari, a ground-living [[New World monkey]] descended from the present-day [[uakari]];
*Carakiller, a giant, 2 meter (7 foot) tall, flightless bird of prey, descended from the present-day [[caracara]];
*Cryptile, a lizard that inhabits salt flats and has a sticky [[neck frill]] for catching [[fly|flies]];
*Deathgleaner, a giant, carnivorous [[bat]] descended from the [[spectral bat]] of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]];
*Gannetwhale, a large, flightless, [[pinniped|seal]]-like seabird descended from the present-day [[gannet]];
*Rattleback, an armoured [[rodent]] descended from the present-day [[agouti]]; there are two species, one in the Amazonian grasslands and the other in the northern deserts;
*Gryken, a slender terrestrial [[mustelid]] descended from the present-day [[pine marten]];
*Scrofa, a wild pig living on the Mediterranean salt flats descended from the [[wild boar]].
*Shagrat, a giant, [[capybara]]-like rodent found in the tundra of northern Europe; descended from the present-day [[marmot]];
*Snowstalker, a large, white, saber-toothed mustelid from northern Europe, descended from the present-day [[wolverine]];
*Spink, a small, [[Mole (animal)|mole]]-like, burrowing [[bird]] found in southern North America, descended from the present-day [[New World quail|quail]].

===100 million years' time===
In the scenario for 100 million years in the future, the world is much hotter than at present. [[Octopus]]es and enormous [[tortoise]]s have come on to the land, much of which is flooded by shallow seas surrounded by brackish swamps. Antarctica has drifted towards the tropics and is covered with dense rainforests, as it was before. Australia has collided with North America and Asia, forcing up an enormous, 12-kilometre-high mountain plateau much taller than the modern Himalayas. [[Greenland]] has been reduced to a small, temperate island. There are cold, deep ocean trenches. The Sahara has once again become the rich grassland it was millions of years ago

;Profiled species

*[[Rhodophyta|Red algae]], a protist that is alive today and evolves into a plant-like shape to form reefs in the absence of [[coral]]s and forge a symbiosis with the Reef Gliders.

;Hypothesized species

*Falconfly, a giant predatory [[wasp]] descended from the [[Bembicini|sand wasp]];
*Grass Tree, a plant species of the Great Plateau, harvested by Silver Spiders to feed the Poggles; descended from [[bamboo]];
*Great Blue Windrunner, a giant, blue, 3 meter (9 foot) wingspan, four-winged crane whose legs have flight feathers that can act as gliding surfaces; it is descended from a present-day [[crane (bird)|crane]];
*Lurkfish, a giant, big-mouthed, charge up with 1,000 volt, electric fish descended from the [[electric catfish]];
*Nursery Vase, a plant that traps water within it and is used as a nursery by the Swampus in a very close [[symbiosis]]. It is similar to the present-day [[pineapple]] and [[bromeliad]] and is possibly a descendant from their lineage.
*Ocean Phantom, a giant descendant of the [[Portuguese man o' war]];
*Poggle, the last surviving [[mammal]], living inside mountains and descended from a species of social [[rodent]];
*Reef Glider, a giant, swimming [[sea slug]];
*Roachcutter, a swift species of Flutterbird, a variety of birds unique to Antarctica that descended from modern-day [[Procellariiformes|tubenosed seabirds]];
*Silver Spider, a large colonial spider
*Spindle Trooper, a giant [[sea spider]] that lives in Ocean Phantoms, which they defend against enemies;
*Spitfire Bird, a species of Flutterbird that shoots acidic flower nectar from its nostrils as a defense;
*False Spitfire Bird, a Flutterbird species that mimics the Spitfire Bird to frighten such predators as the Falconfly;
*Spitfire Beetle, a cooperative, predatory [[beetle]] that preys on Spitfire Birds;
*Spitfire Tree, a flowering tree that makes two chemicals collected by Spitfire Birds, which pollinate the tree in the process;
*Swampus, a semi-terrestrial, brackish [[swamp]]-dwelling [[octopus]];

===200 million years' time===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pangaea Ultimania corrected.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of a hypothetical future Earth ~200 million years hence]] --&gt;

The hypothetical world of 200 million years from now is recovering from a [[mass extinction]] caused by a [[flood basalt]] eruption even larger than the one that created the [[Siberian Traps]], wiping out 99% of the species on the planet. Fish have taken to the skies, squid to the forests, and the world's largest-ever desert is filled with strange worms and insects. All the continents have collided with one another and fused into a single [[supercontinent]], a [[Pangea Ultima|second Pangaea]]. (A few present-day geographical features can still be discerned, including [[Hudson Bay]], [[Novaya Zemlya]] and the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], as well as the general outline of [[Africa]].) One large global ocean with a single-current system gives rise to deadly hurricanes called hypercanes, which batter the coastlines of the continent all year long. The northwestern side of Pangaea II, drenched with an endless supply of [[rain]], has become a temperate forest. Mountains resting at the end of the coast prevent most of the rain's moisture from reaching a long line of scrubby [[Rain shadow|rainshadow deserts]]. The very center of the continent receives no rain at all and has become a barren, plantless desert. Only fish, arthropods, worms and mollusks were left to repopulate the Earth.

;Hypothesized species

*Bumblebeetle, a fast-flying beetle that lives and breeds inside the carcasses of dead Ocean Flish;
*Deathbottle, a carnivorous plant living in the Rainshadow Desert;
*Desert Hopper, a hopping snail with a modified single foot;
*Forest Flish, a small, forest-dwelling, [[hummingbird]]-like fish that no longer lives in the oceans but instead flies like a bird (Flish being a portmanteau of flying and fish);
*Ocean Flish, another type of Flish which relies on the ocean more than does the Forest Flish; like the Forest Flish, it is a descendant of [[flying fish]];
*Garden Worm, an algae-filled worm that feeds only on sunlight;
*Lichen Tree, a descendant of living [[lichen]]s that has grown gigantic due to the high levels of moisture in its environment, reaching 10 feet (3 meters) in height; 
*Megasquid, a 5-meter-high (16.5-feet-high), 8-ton, omnivorous, terrestrial cephalopod; its eight arms have evolved into walking legs like an elephant's; it uses its two long tentacles for feeding (The megasquid is implied in the series to be a distant relative of the swampus of 100 million years earlier);
*Rainbow squid, a 25-meter-long (82-feet-long), gentle, ocean-going cephalopod descended from [[squid]]s;
*Sharkopath, a [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] shark that hunts in packs, descended from [[sharks]];

*Slickribbon, a cave-dwelling, 1-meter-long (3.2-feet-long), predatory worm with a striking resemblance to [[Opabinia]] of the [[Cambrian]];
*Slithersucker, a large, predatory [[slime mold]];
*Squibbon, a terrestrial cephalopod that swings from tree branches; it is highly intelligent and the likeliest ancestor for future life that may allow civilization to once again reestablish itself on [[Earth]]; like the Megasquid it is a descendent of the [[cephalopod]]s;
*Terabyte (not to be confused with the information unit), a highly specialized colonial descendant of [[termite]]s;
*Gloomworm, a primitive-looking, [[bacteria]]-eating worm.

==Production==
''The Future is Wild'' is a £5-million co-production of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), the Franco-German channel [[Arte]], the German [[ZDF]], the Austrian [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], the Italian [[Mediaset]], and [[Animal Planet]] and [[Discovery Channel|Discovery Channels Inc]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="zdf"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mainz|title=''The Future is Wild'' is ZDF Enterprises’ bestselling documentary in 2003|url=http://enterprise-test.zdf.de/en/the_future_is_wild_is_zdf_enterprises’_bestselling_documentary_in_2003.2094.htm|publisher=ZDF Enterprises|accessdate=19 October 2011|date=26 November 2003}} {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC intended that the miniseries would repeat the success it had with its prehistoric documentary series ''[[Walking With Dinosaurs]]'', which attracted 17 million viewers in 1999. The program used [[computer-generated imagery]] to show the possible future of [[life|life on Earth]]. The 13-part series was produced in four years by independent producer John Adams, who conceived it in 1997.&lt;ref name=fish&gt;{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciar|title=Fish in trees and elephant-sized squid - the future as seen on TV|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fish-in-trees-and-elephantsized-squid--the-future-as-seen-on-tv-568162.html|accessdate=19 October 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=30 March 2004}} {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines running to the right are the tapes of genetic instructions, which are copied along with the body of the machines. The machine shown runs in a 32-state version of von Neumann's cellular automata environment, not his original 29-state specification.]]

[[John von Neumann]]'s '''universal constructor''' is a [[self-replicating machine]] in a [[cellular automata]] (CA) environment. It was designed in the 1940s, without the use of a computer. The fundamental details of the machine were published in von Neumann's book ''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata'', completed in 1966 by [[Arthur Burks|Arthur W. Burks]] after von Neumann's death.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;{{Citation| url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofselfrepr00vonn_0| title=''Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata.''| author1=von Neumann, John| author2=Burks, Arthur W.| year=1966| publisher=University of Illinois Press| format=Scanned book online| archivedate=2015-06-24| accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann's goal was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the machine consists of three parts: a 'blueprint' for itself, a mechanism that can read any blueprint and construct the machine (sans blueprint) specified by that blueprint, and a 'copy machine' that can make copies of any blueprint. After the mechanism has been used to construct the machine specified by the blueprint, the copy machine is used to create a copy of that blueprint, and this copy is placed into the new machine, resulting in a working replication of the original machine. Some machines will do this backwards, copying the blueprint and then building a machine.

To define his machine in more detail, von Neumann invented the concept of a cellular automaton. The [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|one he used]] consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 29 states at any point in time. At each timestep, each cell updates its state depending on the states of the surrounding cells at the prior timestep. The rules governing these updates are identical for all cells. 

The universal constructor is a certain pattern of cell states in this cellular automaton. It contains one line of cells that serve as a 'tape', encoding a sequence of instructions that serve as a 'blueprint' for the machine. The machine reads these instructions one by one and performs the corresponding actions. The instructions direct the machine to use its 'construction arm' to build a copy of the machine, without tape, at some other location in the cell grid. The tape can't contain instructions to build an equally long tape, just as a container can't contain a container of the same size. Therefore, the machine contains a separate 'copy machine' which reads the tape and places a copy into the newly constructed machine. The resulting new machine and tape is identical to the old one, and it proceeds to replicate again.

== Purpose ==

Von Neumann's design has traditionally been understood to be a demonstration of the logical requirements for machine self-replication.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000&gt;{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347–361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is clear that far simpler machines can achieve self-replication. Examples include trivial [[Crystal growth|crystal-like growth]], [[template replication]], and [[Langton's loops]]. But von Neumann was interested in something more profound: construction, universality, and evolution.&lt;ref name="walenz.org"&gt;[http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613231149/http://www.walenz.org/vonNeumann/page0110.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This universal constructor can be seen as an abstract [[simulation]] of a physical [[universal assembler]].

Note that the simpler self-replicating CA structures (especially, [[Byl's loop]] and the [[Chou–Reggia loop]]) cannot exist in a wide variety of forms and thus have very limited [[evolvability]]. Other CA structures such as the [[Evoloop]] are somewhat evolvable but still don't support open-ended evolution. Commonly, simple replicators do not fully contain the machinery of construction, there being a degree to which the replicator is information copied by its surrounding environment. Although the Von Neumann design is a logical construction, it is in principle a design that could be instantiated as a physical machine. The issue of the environmental contribution to replication is somewhat open, since there are different conceptions of raw material and its availability.

The concept of a ''universal constructor'' is non-trivial because of the existence of [[Garden of Eden (cellular automaton)|Garden of Eden patterns]]. But a simple definition is that a universal constructor is able to construct any finite pattern of non-excited (quiescent) cells.

Von Neumann's crucial insight is that part of the replicator has a double use; being both an active component of the construction mechanism, and being the target of a passive copying process. This part is played by the tape of instructions in Von Neumann's combination of universal constructor plus instruction tape.

The combination of a universal constructor and a tape of instructions would i) allow self-replication, and also ii) guarantee that the open-ended complexity growth observed in biological organisms was possible.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; The image below illustrates this possibility.

This insight is all the more remarkable because it preceded the discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule by [[James Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], though it followed the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] which identified [[DNA]] as the molecular carrier of genetic information in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Rocha_lec_notes&gt;{{citation |last=Rocha|first=Luis M.|title=Lecture Notes of I-585-Biologically Inspired Computing Course, Indiana University|contribution=Von Neumann and Natural Selection.|url=http://informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/i-bic/pdfs/ibic_lecnotes_c6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA molecule is processed by separate mechanisms that carry out its instructions and copy the DNA for insertion for the newly constructed cell. The ability to achieve open-ended evolution lies in the fact that, just as in nature, errors ([[mutations]]) in the copying of the genetic tape can lead to viable variants of the automaton, which can then evolve via [[Natural Selection|natural selection]].

[[Image:Pesavento replicator inherited mutations.png|thumb|center|700px|A demonstration of the ability of von Neumann's machine to support inheritable mutations. (1) At an earlier timestep, a mutation was manually added to the second generation machine's tape. (2) Later generations both display the [[phenotype]] of the mutation (a drawing of a flower) and pass the mutation on to their children, since the tape is copied each time. This example illustrates how von Neumann's design allows for complexity growth (in theory) since the tape could specify a machine that is more complex than the one making it.]]

== Implementations ==

[[Arthur Burks]] and others extended the work of von Neumann, giving a much clearer and complete set of details regarding the design and operation of von Neumann's self-replicator. The work of J. W. Thatcher is particularly noteworthy, for he greatly simplified the design. Still, their work did not yield a complete design, cell by cell, of a configuration capable of demonstrating self-replication.

[[Renato Nobili]] and Umberto Pesavento published the first fully implemented self-reproducing cellular automaton in 1995, nearly fifty years after von Neumann's work.&lt;ref name=Pesavento1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996&gt;{{Citation|last=Nobili|first=Renato|last2=Pesavento|first2=Umberto|contribution=Generalised von Neumann's Automata|title=Proc. Artificial Worlds and Urban Studies, Conference 1|year=1996|editor-last=Besussi|editor-first=E.|editor2-last=Cecchini|editor2-first=A.|location=Venice|publisher=DAEST|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/%7Ernobili/pdf_files/jvnconstr.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a 32-state cellular automaton instead of von Neumann's original [[Von Neumann cellular automaton|29-state specification]], extending it to allow for easier signal-crossing, explicit memory function and a more compact design. They also published an implementation of a general constructor within the original 29-state CA but not one capable of complete replication - the configuration cannot duplicate its tape, nor can it trigger its offspring; the configuration can only construct.&lt;ref name=NobiliPesavento1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt;

In 2004, D. Mange et al. reported an implementation of a self-replicator that is consistent with the designs of von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE| title=A Macroscopic View of Self-replication| volume=92| issue=12| first=Daniel| last=Mange|last2=Stauffer|first2=A.|last3=Peparaolo|first3=L.|last4=Tempesti|first4=G.| pages=1929–1945| year=2004|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2004.837631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Nobili published a 32-state implementation that uses [[run-length encoding]] to greatly reduce the size of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129003524/http://www.pd.infn.it/~rnobili/wjvn/index.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, William R. Buckley published two configurations which are self-replicators within the original 29-state CA of von Neumann.&lt;ref name=Automata2008&gt;{{Citation|title=Proc. Automata 2008|contribution=Signal Crossing Solutions in von Neumann Self-replicating Cellular Automata| year=2008| first=William R.| last=Buckley|editor=[[Andrew Adamatzky]] |editor2=Ramon Alonso-Sanz |editor3=Anna Lawniczak |editor4=Genaro Juarez Martinez |editor5=Kenichi Morita |editor6=Thomas Worsch |pages=453–503|publisher=Luniver Press|url=http://uncomp.uwe.ac.uk/free-books/automata2008reducedsize.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley claims that the crossing of signal within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators.&lt;ref name=Automata2008/&gt; Buckley also points out that for the purposes of evolution, each replicator should return to its original configuration after replicating, in order to be capable (in theory) of making more than one copy. As published, the 1995 design of Nobili-Pesavento does not fulfill this requirement but the 2007 design of Nobili does; the same is true of Buckley's configurations.

In 2009, Buckley published with [[Golly (program)|Golly]] a third configuration for von Neumann 29-state cellular automata, which can perform either holistic self-replication, or self-replication by partial construction.  This configuration also demonstrates that signal crossing is not necessary to the construction of self-replicators within von Neumann 29-state cellular automata.

C. L. Nehaniv in 2002, and also Y. Takada et al. in 2004, proposed a universal constructor directly implemented upon an asynchronous cellular automaton, rather than upon a synchronous cellular automaton.

As defined by von Neumann, universal construction entails the construction of passive configurations, only. As such, the concept of universal construction constituted nothing more than a literary (or, in this case, mathematical) device. It facilitated other proof, such as that a machine well constructed may engage in self-replication, while universal construction itself was simply assumed over a most minimal case. Universal construction under this standard is trivial. Hence, while all the configurations given here can construct any passive configuration, none can construct the real-time crossing organ devised by Gorman.&lt;ref name="Automata2008"/&gt;

== Practicality ==

=== Computational cost ===

All the implementations of von Neumann's self-reproducing machine require considerable resources to run on computer. For example, in the Nobili-Pesavento 32-state implementation shown above, while the body of the machine is just 6,329 non-empty cells (within a rectangle of size 97x170), it requires a tape that is 145,315 cells long, and takes 63 billion timesteps to replicate. A simulator running at 1,000 timesteps per second would take over 2 years to make the first copy. In 1995, when the first implementation was published, the authors had not seen their own machine replicate. However, in 2008, the [[hashlife]] algorithm was extended to support the 29-state and 32-state rulesets in [[Golly (program)|Golly]]. On a modern desktop PC, replication now takes only a few minutes, although a significant amount of memory is required.

=== Evolvability ===

It has been argued that the problem Von Neumann was trying to address was not self-reproduction ''per se'', but the evolutionary growth of complexity.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt; His “proof-of-principle” designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (“universal”) constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-reproducing machines, spanning a wide range of “complexity” (in von Neumann's sense of “the ability to do complicated things”), interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be “machines”, as conventionally understood. But the result does not show what ''other'' conditions are necessary, in practice, for evolution along such pathways from simple to complex to be spontaneously realised or followed. In his unfinished work he briefly considers conflict and interactions between his self-reproducing machines;&lt;ref name="TSRA"/&gt;{{rp|147}} but in practice, his particular model cannot yield evolutionary dynamics because the machines are too fragile - the vast majority of perturbations cause them effectively to disintegrate.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18001">'''Voodoo death''', a term coined by [[Walter Cannon]] in 1942 also known as '''psychogenic death''' or '''psychosomatic death''', is the phenomenon of sudden [[death]] as brought about by a strong emotional shock, such as fear. The anomaly is recognized as "psychosomatic" in that death is caused by an emotional response—often fear—to some suggested outside force. Voodoo death is particularly noted in native societies, and [[concentration camp|concentration]]- or [[prisoner of war camps]], but the condition is not specific to any particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idStumpfe1979|Stumpfe, K.D. "The psychogenic death of Mr. J. A case report."]] pp. 263–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walter Cannon and his work==
In 1942, [[Walter Bradford Cannon]], MD, now looked to as a forerunner in modern [[physiological psychology]], published a work wherein he postulated the idea that fear could affect a person to the point that their physical condition would deteriorate in response to psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;[[#Reference-idCannon1942|Cannon, Walter. "Voodoo Death."]] pp. 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing examples of extraordinary deaths (and their extraneous circumstances) in aboriginal societies, Cannon posited the idea that fear of [[supernatural]] consequences to broken societal taboos caused the deaths witnessed in the natives.

What Cannon describes has since been termed "bone-pointing syndrome," wherein an individual receives some sort of shock—often the breaking of some social/religious taboo—that he interprets as an ill omen for himself; his physical condition then deteriorates at a rapid rate, and he dies within a period as short as 24 hours after the initial shock.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

Cannon discusses the example of a [[Māori people|Maori]] woman who learned that the fruit she had eaten came from a [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] (tabooed) place; less than 24 hours later she was dead. Conversely, Cannon also shares the example of a young man who had fallen ill when the local witch doctor had pointed a bone at him, a societal taboo that meant a curse of death; however, when the perpetrator explained to the young man that the whole thing had been a mistake, and that no bone had been pointed at him at all, the young man's health returned instantly.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

Cannon notes the similarities in each case: the individuals were both members of a society where beliefs in the supernatural are fiercely upheld, and both had suffered what they both believed to be some form of a [[curse]] as dictated within their personal beliefs; also, the individuals shared similar physical symptoms. And yet, in the case of the young man, once the cause for the psychological distress was removed, his mysterious illness disappeared. Cannon attributes these rather drastic physical repercussions as the workings of the emotion fear upon the mind which then leads to destruction of the physical condition.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

==Causes==
===Cannon's explanation===
According to Cannon, the emotion of fear working on the mind, which he terms the "sympathetic" or "sympathico-adrenal" division of the nervous system, causes a fall in blood pressure as brought on by "a reduction of the volume of circulating blood".&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; Cannon explains the loss of blood volume by the constant injection of adrenaline into the small arterioles which constrict, preventing a proper flow of blood within the body and causing a drop in blood pressure. From there, the weak blood pressure prevents the sufficient circulation of the blood by damaging the heart and nerves responsible for the maintenance of the vessels which transport blood, thus making it harder for circulation to continue since the very organs necessary to maintain proper blood circulation are deteriorating. An accelerated heart rate then ensues, followed by rapid breathing. Added to these symptoms are the effects of no food or drink in the person experiencing psychological distress: Cannon suggests that true shock, in the medical sense, could be the cause of death as a result of little food or drink. States Cannon: "The combination of lack of food and water, anxiety, very rapid pulse and respiration, associated with a shocking experience having persistent effects, would fit well with fatal conditions reported from primitive tribes."&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

===Modern explanations===
Since 1942, scientists have discovered many more of the processes involved in the effect of stress upon the body, such as the region of the brain called the [[amygdala]]. The series of events by which a sensory stimulus is introduced to the mind, and the amygdala processes the emotion of fear which follows is called the "vision-to-fear pathway", or the "auditory-to-fear pathway", depending on the stimulus.

The generally recognized sequence of events, as enumerated by Esther M. Sternberg, MD, in 2002, stands as follows: various chemicals and electrical impulses are released that are transmitted by nerve fibers. Simultaneously, hormones are excreted from the brain, [[adrenal]] and [[pituitary glands]] in response to stress on the system. [[Cardiac arrhythmias]] are often the result of an overabundance of these hormones on the system.&lt;ref name="Esther"&gt;[[#Reference-idSternberg2002|Sternberg, Esther. "Walter B. Cannon and 'Voodoo' Death: A Perspective From 60 Years On."]] pp. 1564–1566.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Wylie Vale]], PhD, discovered [[corticotrophin]], the brain's hypothalamic stress hormone, or CRH: this hormone secreted by the [[hypothalamus]] coordinates with "the brain stem adrenaline centers involved in initiation of the sympathetic response ... to cause a massive release of both adrenaline-like nerve chemicals and stress hormones. Together these might well cause illness, including loss of appetite, weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and even vascular collapse that could result in death."&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt;

Martin A. Samuels, MD, elaborates further on still another process of death, stating that with the release of adrenaline and an increased heart rate, sometimes [[catecholamines]], stress hormones, will build up, leading to calcium channels opening and remaining open, resulting in an overflow of calcium into the system, killing off cells.&lt;ref name="Samuels"&gt;[[#Reference-idKirn2004|Kirn, Timothy. "Voodoo death is brain's lethal response to fear."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parasympathetic over-activation==
Cannon believed that extreme emotional stress could be explained in terms of degree of sympathetic-adrenal excitation. However, an experiment performed by Curt Richter (1957) responded to Cannon's challenge with an animal model. Richter placed pre-stressed rats in a closed turbulent water. the latency to drowning was recorded. Most domestic lab rats lasted for hours while unexpectedly all of the wild rats died within 15 minutes. Richter monitored heart rate and determined whether the heart was in systole or diastole after death. He found out that heart rate slowed down prior to death and the heart was engaged with blood reflecting a state of diastole. This contradicted Cannons proposal that sympathetic adrenal over-activation is the result of death since a sympathetic over-arousal would increase both heart rate and blood pressure to severe degrees.
Richter interpreted this that the rats died as a result of over-stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, specifically the [[vagus nerve]] which regulates heartbeat. The lethal vagal effect was the psychological state of hopelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richter | first1 = C.P. | year = 1957 | title = On the phenomenon of sudden death in animals and man | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 191–8 | doi=10.1097/00006842-195705000-00004| pmid = 13432092 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.536.1405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudden prolonged immobility or faked death is an adaptive response exhibited by many mammalian species. Hofer(1970) demonstrated that several rodent species when threatened exhibited an immobility that was accompanied by a very low heart rate. For some of the rodents that heart rate reached below 50% of the baseline. Hofer distinguished between prolonged immobility and faked death phenomenon. Unlike the behavior of "hopelessness" described by Richter, the death-faking occurred with a sudden motor collapse during active struggling. Hofer interpreted the fear-inducing slowing of heart rate as a vagal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofer | first1 = M.A. | year = 1970 | title = Cardiac respiratory function during sudden prolonged immobility in wild rodents | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 633–47 | doi=10.1097/00006842-197011000-00008| pmid = 5530023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These data suggest that vagus contributes to severe emotional states and may be related to emotional states of immobilization, such as extreme terror. Unfortunately, this immobilization technique is potentially life-threatening for mammals (but not for reptiles). Mammals would undergo states of [[bradycardia]] or [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] as an over-activation of parasympathetic vagus system. The organs of the oxygen-hungry mammal are deprived of oxygen due to lack of blood flow, and the animal dies.

==Critical evaluation==
Despite Cannon's general ignorance on the particulars of physiological breakdown, scientists in the intervening years since the publication of Cannon's work, have generally agreed with his fundamental hypotheses concerning voodoo death. Criticisms that generally come against Cannon's work are directed at the hearsay nature of Cannon's case studies, but recent studies have discovered numerous examples of voodoo death in various societies.&lt;ref name="Lester"&gt;[[#Reference-idLester2009|Lester, David. "Voodoo Death."]] pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; To those who allege difficulty in the experimental process of validating Cannon's theory, Barbara W. Lex, in her 1974 article titled, "Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation", states that "Voodoo death" can easily be observed without complicated experiments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Pupillary constriction, easily observable and indicative of parasympathetic activation ... the amount of saliva, of perspiration, degree of muscle tonicity and skin pallor in an individual are also discernible without complicated instruments."&lt;ref name="Lex"&gt;[[#Reference-idLex2009|Lex, Barbara. "Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation."]] pp. 818–823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are those who contest the theories involving psychologically-induced body failure. David Lester, PhD, in 1972, contends that Cannon's evidence, particularly the evidence concerning animals, is anecdotal and irrelevant, and instead sets forth the concept of "death by suggestion", and supports "giving up-given up" complex set forth by George L. Engel, thus attributing the cause of death entirely to the psychological state of the individual in question rather than a psychological–physiological connection adduced by Cannon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idLester1972|Lester, David. "Voodoo Death: Some New Thoughts on an Old Phenomenon."]] pp. 386–390.&lt;/ref&gt; Going even further, Harry D. Eastwell, MD in his 1982 article, "Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia", rejects entirely the concept of "Voodoo death", stating that the deaths in cases reported by Cannon et al. were more likely due to dehydration rather than to any psychological response.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEastwell1982|Eastwell, Harry D. "Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia."]] pp. 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of this theory on modern science==
===Fight or flight===
Deeply related to these cases of sudden death is what Cannon termed the "[[fight-or-flight response]]", what has been classified as a "neurophysiological-behavioral" response pattern. "Fight or flight" is a phrase used to describe the instinctual and physiological responses to strong emotion within animals as well as humans. Cannon associates the two emotions of rage and fear because of the similar effects the emotions will have upon the mind and body—rage will encourage the response to "fight", while fear will encourage "flight". The mind, when faced with one or both of these emotions in response to a perceived threat, will emit adrenaline, and heart rate will increase; however, sometimes the system is overwhelmed by the responses, and collapse ensues as brought about by the workings of stress hormones.&lt;ref name= "Samuels"/&gt;

In the case of voodoo death, the "flight" response overpowers the system, but there is little to no possibility for action in the mind of the individual suffering from the perceived threat—considering the state of aboriginal tribes, the victims believe themselves to be suffering from a curse in which they are condemned to die, and so they believe themselves to be unable to act to save themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGomez1982|Gomez, E.A. "Voodoo and sudden death: the effects of expectations on health."]] pp. 75–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New fields===
Cannon's theory concerning voodoo death opened research into various fields of psychological studies; since the publication of Cannon's work, scientists have discovered many disorders and the like related to psychosomatic responses to situations. Because of Cannon's postulation that the mind could bring about death, scientists have become open to the idea of the mind working on the body in a greater number of ways, leading to the development of [[psychosomatic medicine]].&lt;ref name="names"&gt;[[#Reference-idLane2009|Lane, R.D., Waldstein, S.R., Chesney, M.A, et al. "The Rebirth of Neuroscience in Psychosomatic Medicine, Part I: Historical Context, Methods, and Relevant Basic Science."]] pp. 117–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of theories concerning voodoo death within the scientific field has also led to the development of a branch of psychology termed [[psychophysiology]].&lt;ref name="names"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
Though cases within aboriginal societies are the most commonly cited when researchers such as Cannon set forth examples, similar cases of psychosomatic death have also been reported in other cultures.

In his 1964 article, James L. Mathis, MD, describes a case of a previously healthy man who died from asthmatic attacks when his mother "cursed" him for going against her wishes. Mathis proposes that "fatal psychosomatic conditions" were the cause of this man's death, and thus a form of voodoo death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idMathis1964|Mathis, James L. "Sophisticated Version of Voodoo Death."]] pp. 104–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist—Clifton K. Meador, MD—in 1992 discussed the case of a man diagnosed with cancer who, along with his physicians and family, believed he was dying of cancer. In the autopsy after his death, however, the doctors discovered that his cancer was not at all the cause of his death. Meador deduces that the man's belief in his imminent death was the cause of his death itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1546347 | volume=85 | issue=3 | title=Hex death: voodoo magic or persuasion? | journal=South Med J | pages=244–7 | last1 = Meador | first1 = CK | doi=10.1097/00007611-199203000-00004| year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
