The '''Colonial Conference of 1897''' was a conference between the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] and the 11 [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[British colony|colonies]] of the [[British Empire]]. The conference was convened in London by Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] in 1897 on the occasion of Diamond Jubilee of [[Queen Victoria]]. Chamberlain's intention was to draw the self-governing colonies into closer co-operation with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=imp/&gt;

Delegates were sent to the conference by Canada, [[Newfoundland Colony]], New Zealand the Australian self-governing colonies of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]], and the South African colonies of [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and the [[Colony of Natal]].&lt;ref name=imp/&gt;

Chamberlain proposed the creation of a permanent Imperial Council made up of delegates from the colonies to act as an Empire-wide parliament with the power to bind the colonies on imperial matters but this was rejected by the colonies due to fears of loss of autonomy. Chamberlain also propose that colonies increase their contributions to the [[Royal Navy]] but only some colonies agreed to increase their contributions and no permanent arrangement was agreed to.&lt;ref name=imp&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical dictionary of European imperialism|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313262578|pages=136–137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chamberlain also proposed a [[customs union]] between the colonies and Britain while Canada proposed [[Imperial preference|preferential trade]] but no decision was made by the delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colonial Conference|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qxsRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JZUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6172,322193&amp;dq=colonial+conference&amp;hl=en|accessdate=27 December 2014|newspaper=Sydney Mail|date=10 July 1897|publisher=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imp2&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical dictionary of European imperialism|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313262578|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC|page=138|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

The year '''1981 in radio''' involved some significant events.

==Debuts==
*March – KWNT (1580 AM) of [[Davenport, Iowa]], switches from its longtime country music format – which it had held since the 1950s, including under its previous call sign KFMA – to a [[golden oldies]] format, emphasizing music of the 1930s through early 1950s. It is the first in a series of format switches at the frequency over the next 19 years – formats ranged from oldies to soul to black gospel – all of them unsuccessful.
*March 30 - Radio stations across America interrupt regular programming following [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|an assassination attempt]] against President [[Ronald Reagan]] outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C.
*April 12 – [[KDKA-FM|WJOI]]/[[Pittsburgh]] flipped from [[beautiful music]] to [[Top 40]], branded as "B94", and adopted the new call letters "WBZZ." That fall, [[WXYT-FM|WWJ-FM]], a beautiful music station in [[Detroit]], picks up the WJOI calls.
*June 1 – [[CJCB-FM]] Sydney, Nova Scotia flips from Easy Listening to Country. Along with the format change, the station changes its call letters to CKPE-FM.
* September 22 – [[WOGL|WCAU-FM]] in [[Philadelphia]] debuts a new [[Hot Hits]] format called "98 Now!" which sweeps the local ratings and inspires parent company CBS to look at converting its other FM stations to similar formats.
* October — "The Weekly Country Music Countdown," a three-hour weekly countdown program featuring the top 30 country hits of the week as reported by ''[[Radio &amp; Records]]'' magazine. Hosted by radio personality Chris Charles, the show is the first successful rival to "[[American Country Countdown]]."

==Deaths==
* March 10 - [[Bob Elson]], an American "pioneer in broadcast journalism" best known for his broadcasting of baseball games of the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Chicago White Sox]].&lt;ref name="trib034481"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Condon|first1=David|title=Ex-Sox, Cubs Broadcaster Elson dies at 76|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1981/03/11/page/1/article/ex-sox-cubs-broadcaster-elson-dies-at-76|accessdate=14 January 2015|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=March 11, 1981|ref=trib031181}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''''Alltagsgeschichte''''' is a form of [[microhistory]] that was particularly prevalent amongst German historians during the 1980s. It was founded by historians [[Alf Luedtke]] and [[:de:Hans Medick|Hans Medick]].

The name comes from German, where ''Alltag'' means "everyday life"; it can thus be roughly translated as "everyday history". In this sense, ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can be considered part of the wider Marxian historical school of '[[People's history|history from below]]'. 

The purpose of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' is to find and prove the links between the down-to-earth, everyday, basic experiences of ordinary people in a society, and the broad social and political changes which occur in that society. Because this is such a massively broad endeavour to undertake, it can only feasibly be practised on the most minute of scales. Thus ''Alltagsgeschichte'' becomes a form of microhistory.

Its leading exponents include [[Paul Veyne]] and Michel Rouche in France, and Peter Carr in the United Kingdom. ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can also be linked to the Italian historical doctrine of ''Microstoria'' (microhistory).

'''Arnold Joseph Toynbee''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|CH|FBA}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔɪ|n|b|i}}; 14 April 1889 – 22 October 1975) was a British [[historian]], [[philosopher of history]], research professor of [[comparative history|international history]] at the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[University of London]] and author of numerous books. Toynbee in the 1918–1950 period was a leading specialist on [[International relations|international affairs]].

He is best known for his 12-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1934–1961). With his prodigious output of papers, articles, speeches and presentations, and numerous books translated into many languages, Toynbee was a widely read and discussed scholar in the [[1940s in sociology|1940s]] and [[1950s in sociology|1950s]].

==Biography==
Toynbee (born in [[London in the 1960s|London]] on 14 April 1889) was the son of Harry Valpy Toynbee (1861–1941), secretary of the [[Charity Organization Society]], and his wife Sarah Edith Marshall (1859–1939); his sister [[Jocelyn Toynbee]] was an archaeologist and art historian. Toynbee was the grandson of [[Joseph Toynbee]], nephew of the [[19th-century philosophy|19th-century]] economist [[Arnold Toynbee]] (1852–1883) and descendant of prominent British intellectuals for several generations. He won scholarships to [[Winchester College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]] ([[Literae Humaniores]], 1907-1911),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orry|first1=Louise|title=Arnold Toynbee, Brief Lives|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198600879|page=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied briefly at the [[British School at Athens]], an experience that influenced the genesis of his philosophy about the decline of civilizations. 

In 1912 he became a tutor and fellow in ancient history at Balliol College, and in 1915 he began working for the intelligence department of the [[British Foreign Office]]. After serving as a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919 he served as professor of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Modern Greece|modern Greek studies]] at the [[University of London]]. It was here that Toynbee was appointed to the [[Koraes Professor of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature |Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature]] at [[King's College London|King's College]], although he would ultimately resign following a controversial academic dispute with the professoriate of the College.&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/classics/about/index.aspx | title=King's College London - Classics at King's}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4283087|title = Politics and the Academy: Arnold Toynbee and the Koraes Chair|journal = Middle Eastern Studies|volume = 21|issue = 4|pages = v–115|last1 = Clogg|first1 = Richard|year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 to 1922 he was the Manchester [[Guardian.co.uk|Guardian]] correspondent during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], an experience that resulted in the publication of ''The Western Question in Greece and Turkey''.&lt;ref name=toynbee1922&gt;{{cite book |last=Toynbee |first=Arnold J. |title=The Western Question in Greece and Turkey: A Study in the Contact of Civilisations |url=http://louisville.edu/a-s/history/turks/WesternQuestion.pdf |year=1922 |location=London |publisher=[[Constable &amp; Robinson|Constable and Company Ltd.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 he became research professor of international history at the [[London School of Economics]] and director of studies at the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] in London. He was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdoms national academy for the humanities and social sciences, in 1937.&lt;ref name="WWW"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Toynbee, Arnold Joseph |url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-160398 |website=[[Who Was Who]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=14 October 2018 |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-160398 |date=1 December 2007|doi-broken-date=2018-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first marriage was to Rosalind Murray (1890–1967), daughter of [[Gilbert Murray]], in 1913; they had three sons, of whom [[Philip Toynbee]] was the second. They divorced in 1946; Toynbee then married his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter (1893-1980), in the same year.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989p124&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

==Academic and cultural influence==
[[File:Toynbee1.jpg|thumb|Toynbee on the front cover of Time magazine, 17 March 1947. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793438,00.html read the ''Time'' article]]]

Michael Lang says that for much of the twentieth century: 
{{quote|Toynbee was perhaps the world’s most read, translated, and discussed living scholar. His output was enormous, hundreds of books, pamphlets, and articles. Of these, scores were translated into thirty different languages....the critical reaction to Toynbee constitutes a veritable intellectual history of the midcentury: we find a long list of the period’s most important historians, [[Charles Austin Beard|Beard]], [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel]], [[R. G. Collingwood|Collingwood]], and so on.&lt;ref name=lang2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lang |first=Michael |title=Globalization and Global History in Toynbee |date=December 2011 |journal=[[Journal of World History]] |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=747–783 |doi=10.1353/jwh.2011.0118 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 April 2014--&gt;{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his best-known work, ''[[A Study of History]]'', published 1934–1961, Toynbee:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...examined the rise and fall of 26 civilizations in the course of [[human history]], and he concluded that they rose by responding successfully to challenges under the leadership of creative minorities composed of elite leaders.&lt;ref name=EBonlineToynbee&gt;{{cite web |title= Arnold Toynbee |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601310/Arnold-Joseph-Toynbee |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online Academic Edition |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |date= 6 Apr 2014 |accessdate= 6 April 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''A Study of History'' was both a commercial and academic phenomenon. In the U.S. alone, more than seven thousand sets of the ten-volume edition had been sold by 1955. Most people, including scholars, relied on the very clear one-volume abridgement of the first six volumes by [[D. C. Somervell|Somervell]], which appeared in 1947; the abridgement sold over 300,000 copies in the U.S. The press printed innumerable discussions of Toynbee's work, not to mention there being countless lectures and seminars. Toynbee himself often participated. He appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1947, with an article describing his work as "the most provocative work of historical theory written in England since Karl Marx’s ''Capital''”,&lt;ref name=kennan1989&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennan |first=George F. |authorlink=George F. Kennan|title=The History of Arnold Toynbee |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/jun/01/the-history-of-arnold-toynbee/?pagination=false |date=1 June 1989 |journal=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a regular commentator on [[BBC]] (examining the history of and reasons for the current hostility between east and west, and considering how non-westerners view the western world).&lt;ref name=montagu1956&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Montagu |editor1-first=M. F. Ashley |editor1-link=Ashley Montagu |title=Toynbee and History: Critical Essays and Reviews |year=1956 |location=Boston |publisher=[[Porter Sargent]] |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcRadio4Toynbee1952&gt;{{cite web |title=The Psychology of Encounters—Arnold Toynbee: The World and the West: 1952 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lpw |website=[[BBC Radio 4]] |series=The Reith Lectures |date=14 December 1952 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian historians were especially receptive to Toynbee's work in the late [[1940s in sociology|1940s]]. The Canadian economic historian [[Harold Adams Innis]] (1894–1952) was a notable example. Following Toynbee and others (Spengler, Kroeber, Sorokin, Cochrane), Innis examined the flourishing of civilizations in terms of administration of empires and media of communication.&lt;ref name=massolin2001&gt;{{cite book |last=Massolin |first=Philip Alphonse |title=Canadian Intellectuals, the Tory Tradition, and the Challenge of Modernity, 1939–1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fL-lB1VJ4wC&amp;pg=PA162 |year=2001 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-0802035097 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toynbee's overall theory was taken up by some scholars, for example, [[Ernst Robert Curtius]], as a sort of paradigm in the post-war period. Curtius wrote as follows in the opening pages of ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953 English translation), following close on Toynbee, as he sets the stage for his vast study of [[medieval Latin]] literature. Curtius wrote, "How do cultures, and the historical entities which are their media, arise, grow and decay? Only a comparative morphology with exact procedures can hope to answer these questions. It was Arnold J. Toynbee who undertook the task."&lt;ref name=curtius1953&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtius |first=Ernst Robert |authorlink=Ernst Robert Curtius|title=European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/European_Literature_and_the_Latin_Middle.html?id=WrSpNfsBcocC |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1953|isbn=978-0691018997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1960, Toynbee's ideas faded both in academia and the media, to the point of seldom being cited today.&lt;ref name=mcintire1989&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=McIntire |editor1-first=C. T. |editor2-last=Perry |editor2-first=Marvin |title=Toynbee: Reappraisals |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=1989 |isbn=978-0802057853}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=perry1996&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Marvin |title=Arnold Toynbee and the Western Tradition |series=American University Studies—5—Philosophy |volume=169 |location=New York |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]] |year=1996 |isbn=978-0820426716}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his work continued to be referenced by classical historians, at least, because "his training and surest touch is in the world of classical antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Gruen |editor-first=Erich S. |editor-link=Erich S. Gruen |title=Imperialism in the Roman Republic |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Imperialism_in_the_Roman_Republic.html?id=w1xoAAAAMAAJ |series=European Problem Studies |chapter=Rome on the Brink of Expansion |year=1970 |publisher=[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] |at=Intro, page 10 |isbn=978-0-030-77620-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His roots in classical literature are also manifested by similarities between his approach and that of classical historians such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is a History of Humanity Possible?|url=http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/history-humanity-possible-oxford-transnational-and-global-history-seminar|website=University of Oxford History Podcasts|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comparative history]], by which his approach is often categorized, has been in the doldrums.&lt;ref name=cohen2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen |first=Deborah |title=Comparative History: Buyer Beware |url=http://www.ghi-dc.org/publications/ghipubs/bu/bulletinF01/29.23-33.pdf |date=Fall 2001 |journal=GHI Bulletin |volume=No. 29 |pages=23–33 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328184207/http://www.ghi-dc.org/publications/ghipubs/bu/bulletinF01/29.23-33.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in [[Jared Diamond]]'s book ''Collapse:  How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'' there are similarities between Toynbee's "Challenge and Response" theory and Diamond's analysis on how elites make decisions at critical moments. For example, Diamond writes in ''Collapse'' that if the elites are insulated from problems in society and not actively engaged, they are more apt to make mistakes. Thus, Diamond may be stating that elites can not mount effective responses to challenges if their knowledge, sympathy, or own self-interest are not sufficiently the same as the broader society.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Political influence in foreign policy==
&lt;blockquote&gt; While the writing of the Study was under way, Toynbee produced numerous smaller works and served as director of foreign research of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1939–43) and director of the research department of the Foreign Office (1943–46); he also retained his position at the London School of Economics until his retirement in 1956.&lt;ref name=EBonlineToynbee/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Toynbee worked for the [[Political Intelligence Department (1918–1920)|Political Intelligence Department]] of the [[Foreign Office|British Foreign Office]] during [[World War I]] and served as a delegate to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919. He was director of studies at Chatham House, Balliol College, Oxford University, 1924–43. Chatham House conducted research for the British Foreign Office and was an important intellectual resource during World War II when it was transferred to London. With his research assistant, Veronica M. Boulter, Toynbee was co-editor of the RIIA's annual ''Survey of International Affairs,'' which became the "bible" for international specialists in Britain.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Meeting with Adolf Hitler===
While on a visit in Berlin in 1936 to address the Nazi Law Society, Toynbee was invited to have a private interview with [[Adolf Hitler]], at Hitler's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brody |first=J. Kenneth |title=The Avoidable War—Volume 2: Pierre Laval and the Politics of Reality, 1935–1936 |date=1 October 1999 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0765806222|title-link=Pierre Laval }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler emphasized his limited expansionist aim of building a greater German nation, and his desire for British understanding and cooperation. Toynbee believed that Hitler was sincere and endorsed Hitler's message in a confidential memorandum for the British prime minister and foreign secretary.&lt;ref name=mcneill1989ch8&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Russia===
Toynbee was troubled by the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], for he saw Russia as a non-Western society and the revolution as a threat to Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paquette |first=Gabriel B. |title=The Impact of the 1917 Russian Revolutions on Arnold J. Toynbee's Historical Thought, 1917–34 |journal=Revolutionary Russia |date=June 2000 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=55–80 |doi=10.1080/09546540008575717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1952 he argued that the Soviet Union had been a victim of Western aggression. He portrayed the Cold War as  a religious competition that pitted a Marxist materialist heresy against the West's spiritual Christian heritage—a heritage that had already been foolishly rejected by a secularized West. A heated debate ensued; an editorial in ''The Times'' promptly attacked Toynbee for treating communism as a "spiritual force".&lt;ref name=mcneill1989p464-5&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William H. |authorlink=William Hardy McNeill |title=Arnold J.

===Greece and the Middle East===
Toynbee was a leading analyst of developments in the Middle East.  His support for Greece and hostility to the Turks during World War I had gained him an appointment to the Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History at [[King's College London|King's College, University of London]].&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"/&gt; However, after the war he changed to a pro-Turkish position, accusing Greece's military government in occupied Turkish territory of atrocities and massacres. This earned him the enmity of the wealthy Greeks who had endowed the chair, and in 1924 he was forced to resign the position.

His stance during World War I reflected less sympathy for the Arab cause and took a pro-Zionist outlook. He also expressed support for a [[Jewish State]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which he believed had "begun to recover its ancient prosperity" as a result. Toynbee investigated [[Zionism]] in 1915 at the Information Department of the Foreign Office, and in 1917 he published a memorandum with his colleague [[Lewis Namier]] which supported exclusive Jewish political rights in Palestine. In 1922, however, he was influenced by the Palestine Arab delegation which was visiting London, and began to adopt their views. His subsequent writings reveal his changing outlook on the subject, and by the late 1940s he had moved away from the Zionist cause and toward the Arab camp.

The views Toynbee expressed in the 1950s continued to oppose the formation of a Jewish state, partly out of his concern that it would increase the risk of a nuclear confrontation. However, as a result of Toynbee's debate in January 1961 with Dr. [[Yaakov Herzog]], the Israeli ambassador to Canada, Toynbee softened his view and called on Israel to fulfill its special "mission to make contributions to worldwide efforts to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Isaiah |title=Arnold Toynbee: Pro-Arab or Pro-Zionist? |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/israel_studies/v004/4.1friedman.html |date=Spring 1999 |journal=Israel Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=73–95 |doi=10.1353/is.1999.0019 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=This is how we ruined Toynbee's theory |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/this-is-how-we-ruined-toynbee-s-theory-1.210993|newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=19 December 2014|date=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Jewish Rights in Palestine",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1453271|title = Jewish Rights in Palestine|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume = 52|issue = 1|pages = 1|last1 = Toynbee|first1 = Arnold J|doi = 10.2307/1453271|year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; he challenged the views of the editor of the [[Jewish Quarterly Review]], historian and talmudic scholar [[Solomon Zeitlin]], who published his rebuke, "Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1453272|title = Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume = 52|issue = 1|pages = 12|last1 = Zeitlin|first1 = Solomon|doi = 10.2307/1453272|year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same issue.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Rights in Palestine (pp. 1-11); Arnold J.

{{quote|"population’s human rights to their homes and property over-ride all other rights in cases where claims conflict." He did concede that the Jews, "being the only surviving representatives of any of the pre-Arab inhabitants of Palestine, have a further claim to a national home in Palestine." But that claim, he held, is valid "only in so far as it can be implemented without injury to the rights and to the legitimate interests of the native Arab population of Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jta.org/1961/12/01/archive/prof-toynbee-rebuked-by-u-s-scholar-for-renewed-attack-on-jews | title=Prof. Toynbee Rebuked by U.S. Scholar for Renewed Attack on Jews| date=December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dialogue with Daisaku Ikeda===
In 1972, Toynbee met with [[Daisaku Ikeda]], president of [[Soka Gakkai International]] (SGI), who condemned the "demonic nature" of the use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances. Toynbee had the view that the atomic bomb was an invention that had caused warfare to escalate from a political scale to catastrophic proportions and threatened humanity's very existence. In his dialogue with Ikeda, Toynbee stated his worry that humankind would not be able to strengthen ethical behavior and achieve self-mastery "in spite of the widespread awareness that the price of failing to respond to the moral challenge of the atomic age may be the self-liquidation of our species."

The two men first met on 5 May 1972 in London. In May 1973, Ikeda again flew to London to meet with Toynbee for 40 hours over a period of 10 days. Their dialogue and ongoing correspondence culminated in the publication of ''Choose Life'', a record of their views on critical issues confronting humanity. The book has been published in 24 languages to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choose Life—Arnold Toynbee and Daisaku Ikeda" Exhibition Opens in Hiroshima |url=http://www.sgi.org/news/c-activities/ce2005/ce050723.html |date=23 July 2005 |website=[[Soka Gakkai|Soka Gakkai International]] |accessdate=13 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053522/http://www.sgi.org/news/c-activities/ce2005/ce050723.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toynbee also wrote the foreword to the English edition of Ikeda's best-known book, ''The Human Revolution'', which has sold more than 7 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=humanrevolution&gt;{{cite book |last=Ikeda |first=Daisaku |authorlink= |title=The Human Revolution |location=Santa Monica |publisher=World Tribune Press |year=2004 |at=Preface |isbn=978-0915678778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition celebrating the 30th anniversary of Toynbee and Ikeda's first meeting was presented in SGI's centers around the world in 2005, showcasing contents of the dialogues between them, as well as Ikeda's discussions for peace with over 1,500 of the world's scholars, intellects, and activists. Original letters Toynbee and Ikeda exchanged were also displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thirtieth Anniversary of Toynbee-Ikeda Dialogue |url=http://www.sgiquarterly.org/news2003Jan-4.html |journal=SGI Quarterly |date=January 2003 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 his granddaughter [[Polly Toynbee]] wrote a critical article for ''[[The Guardian]]'' on meeting Daisaku Ikeda.&lt;ref name=ToynbeeP1984&gt;{{cite news |last=Toynbee |first=Polly |title=The Value of a Grandfather Figure |newspaper=[[Manchester Guardian]] |date=19 May 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenge and response&lt;!--'Toynbee's law of challenge and response' redirects here--&gt;==
With the civilizations as units identified, he presented the history of each in terms of challenge-and-response, sometimes referred to as theory about the law of challenge and response. Civilizations arose in response to some set of challenges of extreme difficulty, when "creative minorities" devised solutions that reoriented their entire society. Challenges and responses were physical, as when the [[Sumer]]ians exploited the intractable swamps of southern [[Iraq]] by organizing the Neolithic inhabitants into a society capable of carrying out large-scale irrigation projects; or social, as when the Catholic Church resolved the chaos of post-Roman Europe by enrolling the new Germanic kingdoms in a single religious community. When a civilization responded to challenges, it grew. Civilizations disintegrate when their leaders stopped responding creatively, and the civilizations then sank owing to nationalism, militarism, and the tyranny of a despotic minority. According to an Editor's Note in an edition of Toynbee's ''A Study of History,'' Toynbee believed that societies always die from suicide or murder rather than from natural causes, and nearly always from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold J. Toynbee|title=A Study of History: Abridgement of Volumes I to VI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbJ-31LPvyoC&amp;pg=PA273|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=273|isbn=9780199826698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He sees the growth and decline of civilizations as a spiritual process, writing that "Man achieves civilization, not as a result of superior biological endowment or geographical environment, but as a response to a challenge in a situation of special difficulty which rouses him to make a hitherto unprecedented effort." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme Snooks|title=The Laws of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vkvMpiag-gC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=91|isbn=9780203452448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arnold J.

==Toynbee Prize Foundation==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Named after Arnold J. Toynbee, the [Toynbee Prize] Foundation was chartered in 1987 'to contribute to the development of the [[social sciences]], as defined from a broad historical view of human society and of human and social problems.' In addition to awarding the Toynbee Prize, the foundation sponsors scholarly engagement with global history through sponsorship of sessions at the annual meeting of the [[American Historical Association]], of international conferences, of the  journal ''New Global Studies'' and of the Global History Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Toynbee Prize Foundation |url=http://toynbeeprize.org/toynbee-prize-foundation/ |publisher=Toynbee Foundation |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Toynbee Prize is an honorary award, recognizing social scientists for significant [[academic]] and public contributions to humanity. Currently, it is awarded every other year for work that makes a significant contribution to the study of global history. The recipients have been [[Raymond Aron]], [[Lord Kenneth Clark]], Sir [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Albert Hirschman]], [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]], [[Bruce Mazlish]], [[John McNeill (botanist)|John McNeill]], [[William McNeill (historian)|William McNeill]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr|Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Barbara Ward]], [[Lady Jackson]], [[Sir Brian Urquhart]], [[Michael Adas]], [[Christopher Bayly]], and [[Jürgen Osterhammel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toynbeeprize.org/global-history-blog/the-2017-toynbee-prize-lecture-arnold-toynbee-and-the-problems-of-today-jurgen-osterhammel/|title=The 2017 Toynbee Prize Lecture: "Arnold Toynbee and the Problems of Today" (Jürgen Osterhammel) {{!}} Toynbee Prize Foundation|website=toynbeeprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Toynbee's ideas also feature in the [[Ray Bradbury]] [[short story]] named "[[The Toynbee Convector]]". He appears alongside [[T. E. Lawrence]] as a character in an episode of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', dealing with the post-[[World War I]] treaty negotiations at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]].  He also receives a brief mention in the [[Charles Harness]] classic, ''The Paradox Men'' (a working title was ''Toynbee 22''). [[Frederick Buechner]] also mentions him in the 1957 novel ''The return of Ansel Gibbs''. Most versions of the ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' computer game refer to his work as a historian as well. Toynbee receives mention in Pat Frank's post-apocalyptic novel "[[Alas, Babylon]]". A character in the P. Schuyler Miller short story "As Never Was" adopts the name Toynbee "out of admiration for a historian of that name". He is also mentioned in the [[Tom Robbins]] novel, ''[[Another Roadside Attraction]]''. The [[Toynbee tiles]] may be a reference to Toynbee.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[image:artis historicae penus 1579.jpg|thumb|''Artis Historicae Penus'', 1579]]
[[image:artis historicae penus contents.png|thumb|In this copy Protestants [[David Chytraeus]], [[Johann Jakob Grynaeus|Grynaeus]], Curione &amp; [[Theodor Zwinger|Zwinger]] are stricken by a Jesuit censor.]]

'''''Artis Historicae Penus''''' (''Treasury of the Art of History'', 1579) is a compilation of 18 [[ars historica]] works brought out in 1579 by the late [[Renaissance]] [[Basel]] printer [[Pietro Perna]]. This compendium in [[octavo]] appeared in 2 volumes with a copious index. A third volume adds the final work by {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Riccoboni|it}}, often missing in library collections as a separate edition. Three years earlier, in 1576, Perna brought out a single volume in the same format that ran to 1140 pages and featured the central work of Jean Bodin in its title, along with twelve other authors. Perna writes a letter to the lover of histories (Historiarum amatori Typographus). Editor Johann Wolf dedicates the second collection to [[Frederick I of Wurttemberg]]. He states that he has included all the princely dedications and prefaces of the single works from the source editions for the sake of completeness.

The [[ars historica]] and its classical [[exempla]] were important pedagogical tools for the education of princes, treasured for the lessons in statecraft found in histories. They also served as an antidote to the influence of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].     
The [[Counter Reformation]] [[polyhistor]] [[Antonio Possevino]] fathered a [[Jesuit]] [[ars historica]] to replace the influence of Bodin and the heterodox authors of the Perna collection in his [[Bibliotheca selecta]] 1593 and expanded it to an [[Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam]] 1597.

{{For|the extinct order of cephlopods|belamites}}
'''Belemite''' was a term used during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by English troops to describe an officer who shirked his duty, preferring to remain safely behind the lines. [[Belém (Lisbon)|Belém]], outside of Lisbon, was the location of a convent used by the army as a hospital. [[Charles Oman]] in his 1912 “Wellington's Army, 1809–1814” describes,
{{Quote|The "Belemites," so called from the general depot at the convent of Belem in the suburbs of Lisbon. This was the headquarters of all officers absent from the front as convalescents or on leave, and the limited proportion who stayed there over-long, and showed an insufficient eagerness to return to their regiments, were nicknamed from the spot where they lingered beyond the bounds of discretion.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] occasionally gave an order to Colonel Peacocke, the military governor of Lisbon, to rout up this coterie. There were always a sprinkling there who were not over-anxious to resume the hard life of campaigning, and loved too much the gambling-hells and other sordid delights of Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-xOAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=WELLINGTON%27S+ARMY,+1809-1814&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiy2qT955LOAhXG2R4KHZRFAscQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Belemites&amp;f=false Wellington's Army, 1809-1814] by C.

'''Bonapartism''' is the political ideology of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his followers and successors. It was later used to refer to people who hoped to restore the [[House of Bonaparte]] and its style of government. After Napoleon, the term was applied to the French politicians who seized power in the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]], ruling in the [[French Consulate]] and subsequently in the [[First French Empire|First]] and [[Second French Empire|Second]] French Empires under the [[House of Bonaparte]] (the family of Bonaparte and his nephew [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoleon]]). The term was used more generally for a political movement that advocated a dictatorship or [[authoritarian]] [[centralized government|centralized state]], with a [[strongman (political)|strongman]] charismatic leader based on [[populism|anti-elitist]] rhetoric, army support, and conservatism.

[[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] developed a vocabulary of political terms that included Bonapartism, derived from their analysis of the career of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], and was a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used "Bonapartism" to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and use selective reforms to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. Marx argued that in the process, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class.

According to his essay "[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]" (1852), Marx believed that both Napoleon and his nephew [[Napoleon III]] had corrupted revolutions in [[France]] in this way. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history by saying: "Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."

More generally, "Bonapartism" may be used to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Many &lt;!--who, specifically, with cite to RS --&gt;modern-day [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and other leftists use the phrase "left Bonapartist" to describe those, such as [[Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], who controlled 20th-century bureaucratic socialist regimes. In addition, [[Leon Trotsky]] was accused of using his position as commander of the [[Red Army]] to gain top-level power after [[Lenin]]'s death.

Noted political scientists and historians greatly differ on the definition and interpretation of Bonapartism. Sudhir Hazareesingh's book ''The Legend of Napoleon'' explores numerous interpretations of the term. He says that it refers to a 
"popular national leader confirmed by popular election, above party politics, promoting equality, progress, and social change, with a belief in religion as an adjunct to the State, a belief that the central authority can transform society and a belief in the 'nation' and its glory and a fundamental belief in national unity."{{cn|date=December 2015}} Hazareesingh believes that although recent research shows Napoleon used forced conscription of French troops, some men must have fought believing in Napoleon's ideals. He says that to argue Bonapartism co-opted the masses is an example of the Marxist perspective of [[false consciousness]]: the idea that the masses can be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends. 

==Ideology==

Philosophically, Bonapartism was Napoleon's adaptation of principles of the [[French Revolution]] to suit his imperial form of rule. Desires for public order, French national glory, and emulation of the [[Roman Empire]] had combined to create a [[Caesarism|Caesarist]] ''coup d'etat'' for General Bonaparte on [[18 Brumaire]]. Though he espoused adherence to revolutionary precedents, he "styled his direct and personal rule on the Old Regime monarchs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Truesdell |first=Matthew |title=Spectacular Politics: Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and the Fête impériale, 1849-1870 |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-510689-3|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8f1SwirhmHMC&amp;pg=PA58 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Bonapartists, the most significant lesson of the Revolution was that unity of government and the governed was paramount. 

The [[Bee (mythology)|honey bee]] was a prominent political emblem for both the First and Second Empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/essential_napoleon/symbols/index.asp#abeilles |title=History of the Two Empires: The Symbols of Empire |author= |year=2008 |publisher=Fondation Napoléon |accessdate=17 September 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the Bonapartist ideal of devoted service, self-sacrifice and social loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Englund |first=Steven  |title=Napoleon: A Political Life |year=2005 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-01803-7 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-ZJbxGwU4cC&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristics of political Bonapartism were flexibility and adaptability. [[Napoleon III]] once commented on the diversity of opinions in his cabinet, united under the banner of Bonapartism. Referring to the leading figures in the government of the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]], he remarked: "The [[Empress Eugenie|Empress]] is a [[Legitimist]], [[Duc de Morny|Morny]] is an [[Orléanist]], [[Prince Napoléon Bonaparte|Prince Napoleon]] is a [[republicanism|Republican]], and I myself am a [[Socialist]]. There is only one Bonapartist, [[Persigny]]&amp;nbsp;–  and he is mad!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jerrold |first=Blanchard |title=The Life of Napoleon III |year=1882 |publisher=Longmans, Green |location=London |page=378 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbUwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA378|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Common Violet.JPG|thumb|During his exile to Elba (1814–1815), Napoleon Bonaparte announced he would return in the spring. The violet became a symbol of this and of Bonapartism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lindsay|first=Suzanne G.|title=Funerary Arts and Tomb Cult: Living with the Dead in France, 1750-1870|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2261-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pONxfBACLPUC&amp;pg=PA172 172] (footnote 16)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[France|French]] [[politics|political]] history, ''[[Bonapartiste]]s'' were [[monarchist]]s who desired a French Empire under the House of Bonaparte, the [[Corsica]]n family of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (Napoleon I of France) and his nephew Louis-Napoleon ([[Napoleon III of France]]).

Bonapartism developed after Napoleon I was exiled to [[Elba]]. The Bonapartists helped him regain his power, leading to the [[Hundred Days]] period. Some of his acolytes could not accept his defeat in 1815 at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] or the [[Congress of Vienna]], and continued to promote the Bonaparte ideology. After Napoleon I's death in exile on [[Saint Helena]] in 1821, many of these people transferred their allegiance to other members of his family. After the death of Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt (known to Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II]]), Bonapartist hopes rested on several different members of the family.&lt;ref name=Riff1990&gt;{{Cite book|last=Riff |first=Michael A.|title=Dictionary of Modern Political Ideologies |year=1990 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-3289-9|page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh4NAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disturbances of 1848 gave hope to the nascent political undercurrent. Bonapartism, as an ideology of politically neutral French peasants and workers (EJ Hobsbawm), was essential in the election of Napoleon I's nephew Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte as [[President of France|President]] of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], and gave him the political support necessary for his 1852 discarding of the constitution and proclaiming the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte assumed the title [[Napoleon III]] to acknowledge the brief reign of Napoleon's son Napoleon II at the end of the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815 (see the [[abdication of Napoleon (1815)|abdication of Napoleon I]] in 1815).

In 1870, the [[French National Assembly]] forced Napoleon III to sign a declaration of war against Prussia; France suffered a disastrous defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The emperor surrendered to the Prussians and their German allies to avoid further bloodshed at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)]]. He went into exile after a parliamentary coup created the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Acton|first=Lord |authorlink=John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton |title=The Cambridge Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNFmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA495|accessdate=18 September 2011|year=1909|publisher=Macmillan Co. |location=New York |page=495ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonapartists continued to agitate for another member of the family to be placed on the throne. From 1871 forward, they competed with [[Monarchist]] groups that favoured the restoration of the family of [[Louis-Philippe]], [[King of the French]] (1830–1848) (the [[Orléanist]]s), and also with those who favoured the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]], the traditional French [[royal family]] ([[Legitimist]]s). The strength of these three factions combined was powerful, but they did not unite on the choice of the new French monarch. Monarchist fervor eventually waned, and the French Republic became more or less a permanent facet of French life. Bonapartism was slowly relegated to being the civic faith of a few romantics as more of a hobby than a practical political philosophy. The death knell for Bonapartism was probably sounded when [[Eugène Bonaparte]], the only son of Napoleon III, was [[Anglo-Zulu War|killed in action]] while serving as a [[British Army]] officer in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] in 1879. Thereafter Bonapartism ceased to be a significant political force.

The current head of the Bonaparte family is the Prince Napoleon, great-great-great-grandson of Napoleon I's brother Jérôme Bonaparte, [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon|Jean-Christophe Napoléon]] (born 1986). There are no remaining descendants in the male line from any other of Napoleon's brothers. There is no serious political movement that aims to restore any of these men to the imperial throne of France.

==Bonapartist claimants==
[[File:Pierson - Jérôme Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|Jérôme Bonaparte, founder of the legitimate line]]

After becoming Emperor in 1804, Napoleon I established a Law of Succession, providing that the Bonapartist claim to the throne should pass firstly to Napoleon's own legitimate male descendants through the male line. At that time he had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. He eventually achieved an annulment, without Papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine. He married the younger [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], with whom he had one son. 

The law of succession provided that if Napoleon's own direct line died out, the claim passed first to his older brother Joseph and his legitimate male descendants through the male line, then to his younger brother Louis and his legitimate male descendants through the male line. His other brothers, Lucien and Jerome, and their descendants, were omitted from the succession (even though Lucien was older than Louis) because they had either politically opposed the Emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. Napoleon abdicated in favor of his son after his defeat in 1815. Although the Bonapartes were deposed and the old Bourbon monarchy restored, Bonapartists recognized this child as Napoleon II. A sickly child, he was virtually imprisoned in Austria, and died young and unmarried, without any descendants. When the Bonaparte Empire was restored to power in France in 1852, the Emperor was Napoleon III, [[Louis Bonaparte]]'s only living legitimate son (their brother Joseph having died in 1844 without having had a legitimate son, only daughters).

In 1852, Napoleon III enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim was given to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line (though at that time he had no son, Louis later had a legitimate son, [[Eugène Bonaparte]], who was recognized by Bonapartists as "Napoleon IV" before dying young and unmarried). If Napoleon III's line died out, he decreed that the claim should pass to Jerome, Napoleon's youngest brother (who had previously been excluded), and his male descendants by Princess [[Catharina of Württemberg]] in the male line. (Excluded were his descendants by his first marriage, to the American commoner [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth Patterson]], of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved.) The Bonapartist claimants since 1879, have been the descendants of Jerome and Catherine of Württemberg in the male line.

The Bonapartist laws of succession were far from traditional. The family members ignored [[primogeniture]] (by excluding [[Lucien Bonaparte]] and his descendants); they annulled marriages to achieve their goals; and they did not submit to the Pope's rights as final arbiter on the validity of marriages. The very claim of the Bonaparte family to rule France was far from traditional.

==Marxism==

Based on the career of [[Louis Bonaparte]], [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] defined Bonapartism as a political expression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/], Marxists website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], as well as a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used the term ''[[Bonapartism (Marxism)|Bonapartism]]'' to refer to a situation in which [[counterrevolutionary]] military officers seize power from [[revolutionaries]], and use selective [[reformism]] to co-opt the radicalism of the masses. In the process, Marx argued, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower [[ruling class]]. He believed that both Napoleon I and Napoleon III had corrupted revolutions in France in this way.  Marx offered this definition of and analysis of Bonapartism in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'', written in 1852. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history with one of his most quoted lines, typically condensed aphoristically as: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Surveys in Exile |last=Marx |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx |editor=David Fernbach |year=1973 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, UK |isbn=978-0-14-021603-5 |page=146 |quote=Hegel remarks somewhere that all great events and characters of world history occur, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that a Bonapartist regime could exert great power, because there was no class with enough confidence or power to firmly establish its authority in its own name. A leader who appeared to stand above the class struggle could take the mantle of power. He believed that this was an inherently unstable situation, as the apparently all-powerful leader would be swept aside when the class struggle in society was resolved. 

[[Leon Trotsky]] described [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime as Bonapartist, as he believed it was balanced between the [[proletariat]], victorious but shattered by war, and the [[bourgeoisie#The Marxist view|bourgeoisie]], broken by the revolution but struggling to re-emerge.  The failure of Stalin's regime to disintegrate under the shock and disruption of the losses of the Second World War, and the success of its expansion into Eastern Europe, challenged this analysis. Many [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] rejected the idea that Stalin's regime was Bonapartist. [[Tony Cliff]] described such regimes as [[State capitalism#Use by Trotskyists|state capitalist]] in type and not as deformed [[socialist state|workers' states]] at all. In the last year of his life, Trotsky argued the example of Napoleon's expanding empire. He had achieved the abolition of serfdom in Poland and other French holdings, but his empire was still "Bonapartist."

"Bonapartism" may be used generally to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Some modern-day Trotskyists and others on the left use the phrase ''left Bonapartist'' to describe leaders such as Stalin and [[Mao Zedong]], who controlled left-wing or populist totalitarian regimes. Bonapartism was an example of the Marxist idea of false consciousness: the masses could be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends.

==Bonapartism in the French political spectrum==

According to historian [[René Rémond]]'s famous 1954 book, ''Les Droites en France'', Bonapartism constitutes one of the three French [[right-wing]] families; the latest one after [[far-right]] [[Legitimism]] and [[center-right]] [[Orleanism]]. Both [[Boulangisme]] and [[Gaullism]] would be forms of Bonapartism.

However, Bonapartists have consistently disagreed with this classification, as one of the fundamentals of Bonapartism as an ideology is the refusal to adhere to the left-right divide, which they see as an obstacle to the welfare and unity of the nation. Martin S Alexander, in his book "French History since Napoleon" (London, Arnold, New York, Oxford University Press, 1999) notes that Bonapartism as an idea would not have made a significant impact if it had been classifiable as either left-wing or right-wing. The historian Jean Sagnes in "The roots of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's Socialism" notes that the future Emperor of the French edited his political works through far-left publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Sagnes |title= Les racines du socialisme de Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte |location= Toulouse |publisher= Privat |date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Bonapartist philosophy would fit into the space occupied by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Parti Socialiste]], the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Mouvement Démocrate]], the [[European Social Liberal Party|Nouveau Centre]] and the left wing of the conservative [[Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]], as these parties occupy the ideological space between parties advocating class struggle and race-based politics, both of which are anathema to Bonapartists, as contrary to the ideal of national unity and religious and ethnic tolerance. This is demonstrated by Napoleonic policy towards industrial disputes, one expression of which&amp;nbsp;– as Frank McLynn writes&amp;nbsp;–  is that strikes were forbidden by Napoleon I but in exchange the police sometimes prevented wages from being lowered,{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=482}} while another is the [[Napoleon and the Jews|assimilation and protection of the Jews.]]

The Marxist theory of "Left" and "Right" Bonapartism can be considered an illustration of what McLynn refers to as Napoleon I's appeal in equal measure "to both the Right and the Left",{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=667}} and what Vincent Cronin describes as "middle of the way", or "moderate" government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Cronin |date=1994 |title=Napoleon |publisher=HarperCollins |chapter=Chapter 19 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III situated Bonapartism (or the "Napoleonic Idea") between the radicals and conservatives (respectively the Left and the Right) in "Des Idées Napoléoniennes", published in 1839. He expounded on this point to explain that Bonapartism, as practiced by his uncle Napoleon the Great (and represented by himself) was in the middle of "two hostile parties, one of which looks only to the past, and the other only to the future" and combined "the old forms" of the one and the "new principles" of the other.

==Modern Bonapartism==
{{further|Neo-Bonapartism}}

In contemporary times, the term "Bonapartism" has been used in a general sense to describe autocratic, highly centralized regimes dominated by the military.&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;{{Cite book |last=Calhoun |first=Craig J. |authorlink=Craig Calhoun |title=Dictionary of the Social Sciences |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=978-0-19-512371-5 |page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfISGq3aB2UC&amp;pg=PA47 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, an official ''Mouvement Bonapartiste'' exists, based in France, headed by Paul-Napoléon Pierre Calland with an unknown number of members around the world. Its official mission statement is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]o defend, make known and to spread the principles and values of Bonapartism. [The movement] is based on popular support for a policy of recovery combining the efforts of individuals, associations and State services. The movement defends the Bonapartist principles on which it is founded, and which govern its internal organisation. It also defends the memory of Napoleon the Great, as well as those of Napoleon III and their sons, Napoleon II and Napoleon IV. It recognises Napoleon IV as having reigned without governing, by virtue of the plebiscite of May 1870. The movement recognises no emperor after 1879, because of the absence of a plebiscite. Republican, it gives priority to the happiness, interest and glory of peoples, and envisages the restoration of the Empire only if the foundations of the regime are republican and approved by referendum."&lt;ref name=mouvementbonapartiste&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mouvementbonapartiste.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/bonapartist-movement |title=Bonapartist Movement |year=2011 |publisher=Mouvement Bonapartiste |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This skyscraper stands on the site of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}''. (Photo taken from {{lang|fr|Rue Samaritaine}}).]]
In [[urban planning]], '''Brusselization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK and US]]) or '''Brusselisation '''([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|UK variant]]) ({{lang-fr|bruxellisation}}, {{lang-nl|verbrusseling}}) is "the indiscriminate and careless introduction of modern high-rise buildings into [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighbourhoods" and has become a byword for "haphazard urban development and redevelopment".{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}

The notion applies to anywhere whose development follows the pattern of the uncontrolled development of [[Brussels]] in the 1960s and 1970s, that resulted from a lack of [[zoning]] regulations and the city authorities' laissez-faire approach to city planning.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Papadopoulos|1996|p=66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Romańczyk, K. M. |doi=10.1016/j.cities.2011.08.007 |title=Transforming Brussels into an international city — Reflections on 'Brusselization' |year=2012 |journal=Cities |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=126–132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brussels ==

=== From the 1960s to the 1980s ===
The original Brusselization was the type of urban regeneration performed by the city of [[Brussels]] in connection with [[Expo 58]]. In order to prepare the city for Expo 58, buildings were torn down without regard either to their architectural or historical importance,{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} high-capacity square office/apartment buildings were built, boulevards were created and tunnels dug. Among the most controversial was the large-scale demolition of [[townhouse]]s for development of the high-rise business district in the [[Northern Quarter (Brussels)|Northern Quarter]]. All of these changes were designed to quickly increase the number of people working and living in the city and improve transportation.

Further radical changes resulted from Brussels's role as the center of the [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]],{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Elliott|Cole|2010|p=64}} beginning with the construction of the [[European Commission]] headquarters in 1959.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} The introduction of a high-speed rail network in the 1990s was the latest excuse to speculate on multiple rows of properties for modern office/hotel redevelopment, which led to the razing of neighborhood blocks near [[Brussels-South railway station]].

These changes caused outcry amongst the citizens of Brussels and by [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[preservationism|preservationist]] organizations. The demolition of [[Victor Horta]]'s [[Art Nouveau]] ''{{lang|fr|[[Maison du Peuple]]}}'' in 1965 was one focus of such protests, (see photograph on right for what now stands on its site), as was the construction of the IBM Tower in 1978.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}

Many architects protested, and it was the architectural world that coined the name Brusselization for what was happening to Brussels. Architects such as {{lang|fr|[[Léon Krier]]}} and {{lang|fr|[[Maurice Culot]]}} formulated an [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] urban planning theory, as a rejection of the rampant modernism that they saw overtaking Brussels.{{sfn|Lagrou|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Béghain|Gabilliet|2004|p=109}}

=== Historical precedent and underpinnings for modernization in Brussels ===
The 1950s was not the first time that the city had been radically altered by major redevelopment. Two prior sweeping changes to the urban fabric of Brussels were the straight-lined central avenues modeled after [[Paris]], which were created by [[covering of the Senne|covering and diverting the Senne]] river, and the [[North–South connection|North–South railway connection]], which took around 40 years to finish (1911–52) and which had left swaths of the city center filled with debris and craters for decades. Another precedent is the erecting of the [[Palais de Justice, Brussels|Palace of Justice]], the largest building in the world constructed in the 1800s. [[André de Vries]] asserts that the penchant for heavy-handedness can be traced back to the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in the late 19th century, and possibly even all the way back to the [[bombardment of Brussels|bombardment of the city]] by [[Louis XIV]]'s troops in 1695. "There is barely one building still standing", he says, "from before 1695, with the exception of some churches and the Town Hall".{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

Leopold II sought to give Brussels the image of a grand capital city of an imperial/colonial power. By the middle 20th century there was a tacit alliance between urban development entrepreneurs and local government, with a modernist agenda and with their sights set firmly on large-scale development projects. The citizens of Brussels were largely left out of the process.{{sfn|Swyngedouw|Moyersoen|2006|p=158}}

=== The 1990s: From Brusselization to façadism ===
[[File:Brusselisation in bucharest.jpg|thumb|250px|Brusselization in contemporary [[Bucharest]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}]]
In the early 1990s laws were introduced restricting the demolition of buildings that were deemed to have architectural or historical significance; and in 1999 the city authorities' urban development plan explicitly declared high-rise buildings to be architecturally incompatible with the existing aesthetics of the city centre.{{sfn|State|2004|p=51–52}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}} This led to the rise of what was termed ''{{lang|fr|[[facadism|façadisme]]}}'' — the destruction of the whole interior of a historic building while preserving its historic [[façade]].{{sfn|Hein|2004|p=264}}{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=121}}{{sfn|De Vries|2003|p=14}}

These laws were the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local authorities the powers to refuse demolition requests on the grounds of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the [[Brussels Capital Region]] the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for demolition permits. Not until the introduction of a ''{{lang|fr|permis unique}}'' system was this internecine conflict resolved.{{sfn|Stubbs|Makaš|2011|pp=120}}

'''Church history''' or '''ecclesiastical history''' as an [[academic discipline]] studies the [[history of Christianity]] and the way the [[Christian Church]] has developed since its inception. 

[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]] defined church history as "the spiritual side of the history of civilized people ever since our Master's coming".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]], ''Early Church History to A.D. 313'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A. M. Renwick, however, defines it as an account of the Church's success and failure in carrying out Christ's [[Great Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Renwick and [[Allan Harman|A. M. Harman]], ''The Story of the Church'' (3rd ed.), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Renwick suggests a fourfold division of church history into [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary activity]], [[Ecclesiastical polity|church organization]], [[Christian theology|doctrine]] and "the effect on human life".

Church history is often, but not always, studied from a Christian perspective. Writers from different Christian traditions will often highlight people and events particularly relevant to their own [[denominational]] history. Catholic and Orthodox writers often highlight the achievements of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]], while [[evangelical]] historians may focus on the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Great Awakening]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="189079">The [[Book of Joshua]] lists almost 400 ancient [[Levant]]ine city names (including alternative names and derivatives in the form of words describing citizens of a town) which refer to over 300 distinct locations in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. Each of those cities, with minor exceptions (e.g. [[Hamath]], [[Gubla]]) is placed in one of the 12 regions, according to the [[tribes of Israel]] and in most cases additional details like neighbouring towns or geographical landmarks are provided. It has been serving as one of the primary sources for identifying and locating a number of [[Middle Bronze Age|Middle Bronze]] to [[Iron Age]] [[Levant]]ine cities mentioned in ancient [[Egypt]]ian and [[Canaan]]ite documents, most notably in the [[Amarna correspondence]].

Gibbethon belonged to Ekron, the more so in view of the fact that Gab-bu-tú-nu is recorded in an epigraph of Sargon II, who seized Ekron

'''Cultural materialism''' is an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] research orientation first introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in his 1968 book ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'',&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |year=2001a |orig-year=First published 1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=978-0-7591-0132-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010|ref = harv}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy.

Harris's concept of cultural materialism was influenced by the writings of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as their theories as modified by [[Karl August Wittfogel]] and his 1957 book, ''[[Oriental Despotism (book)|Oriental Despotism]]''.{{sfnb|Harris|2001a| p = 673ff}} Yet this  [[economic materialism|materialism]] is distinct from [[Marxist]] [[dialectical materialism]], as well as from [[materialism|philosophical materialism]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{citation |year=2004 |author=Moore, Jerry D |chapter=Marvin Harris: Cultural Materialism |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAFPjP3yg10C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22Marvin+Harris%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BDCLTP_2AYTJcay3-b0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marvin%20Harris%22&amp;f=false |pages=203–215 |title=Visions of Culture: An Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists |edition=2nd |place=Walnut Creek, CA |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=978-0-7591-0410-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QAFPjP3yg10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Visions+of+Culture%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0411-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]]'s work encouraged Harris to consider reproduction of equal importance to production. The research strategy was also influenced by the work of earlier anthropologists including [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Edward Tylor]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] who, in the 19th century, first proposed that cultures evolved from the less complex to the more complex over time. [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] and their theories of [[cultural evolution]] and [[cultural ecology]] were instrumental in the reemergence of evolutionist theories of culture in the 20th century and Harris took inspiration from them in formulating cultural materialism.

==[[epistemology|Epistemological]] principles==
Cultural materialism is a scientific [[Research#Research methods|research strategy]] and as such utilizes the [[scientific method]]. Other important principles include [[operational definition]]s, [[Karl Popper]]'s [[falsifiability]], [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s [[paradigms]], and the [[positivism]] first proposed by [[Auguste Comte]] and popularized by the [[Vienna Circle]]. The primary question that arises in applying the techniques of science to understand the differences and similarities between cultures is how the research strategy "treats the relationship between what people say and think as subjects and what they say and think and do as objects of scientific inquiry".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bp29&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p29.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this cultural materialism makes a distinction between behavioral events and ideas, values, and other mental events.

It also makes the distinction between [[emic and etic]] operations. Emic operations, within cultural materialism, are ones in which the descriptions and analyses are acceptable by the native as real, meaningful, and appropriate. Etic operations are ones in which the categories and concepts used are those of the observer and are able to generate scientific theories. The research strategy prioritizes etic behavior phenomena.

==Theoretical principles==
* [[Etic]] and behavioral infrastructure, comprising a society's relations to the environment, which includes their ethics and behavioral modes of production and reproduction (material relations).
* Etic and behavioral [[Structure]], the ethics and behavioral domestic and political economies of a society (social relations).
* Etic and behavioral [[base and superstructure|Superstructure]], the ethics and behavioral symbolic and ideational aspects of a society, e.g. the arts, rituals, sports and games, and science (symbolic and ideational relations).
* Emic and mental Superstructure, including "conscious and unconscious cognitive goals, categories, rules, plans, values, philosophies, and beliefs" (Harris 1979:54) (meaningful or ideological relations).

Within this division of culture, cultural materialism argues for what is referred to as the principle of probabilistic infrastructural determinism.  The essence of its materialist approach is that the infrastructure is in almost all circumstances the most significant force behind the evolution of a culture. Structure and superstructure are not considered "insignificant, epiphenomenal reflexes of infrastructural forces".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bp72&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p.72&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and symbolic/ideational aspects act as regulating mechanisms within the system as a whole.

The research strategy predicts that it is more likely that in the long term infrastructure probabilistically determines structure, which probabilistically determines the superstructures, than otherwise. Thus, much as in earlier Marxist thought, material changes (such as in technology or environment) are seen as largely determining patterns of social organization and ideology in turn.

===Disagreement with Marxism===
In spite of the debt owed to the economic theories of Marx and Engels, cultural materialism rejects the Marxist [[dialectic]] which in turn was based on the theories of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

== Research ==
During the 1980s, Marvin Harris had a productive interchange with behavioral psychologists, most notably Sigrid Glenn, regarding interdisciplinary work.  Very recently, behavioral psychologists have produced a set of basic exploratory experiments in an effort toward this end.&lt;ref name=Wardetal2009&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author1=Ward, Todd.A. |author2=Eastman, Raymond. |author3= Ninness, Chris |last-author-amp=yes |title=An Experimental Analysis of Cultural Materialism: The Effects of Various Modes of Production on Resource Sharing |journal=Behavior and Social Issues |volume=18 |pages=58–80 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/viewFile/1950/2185 |accessdate=10 September 2010 |doi=10.5210/bsi.v18i1.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently young anthropologists have re-approached the work of Marvin Harris as part of a new anthropology of infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=2009 |author=Dalakoglou, D. |title=An Anthropology of Road |url= https://books.google.com/?id=N90nlwEACAAJ&amp;dq=an+anthropology+of+the+road+Dalakoglou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Petrarch by Bargilla.jpg|right|thumb|[[Petrarch]], who conceived the idea of a European "Dark Age". From ''Cycle of Famous Men and Women'', [[Andrea di Bartolo di Bargilla]], c. 1450]]

The "'''Dark Ages'''" is a historical [[periodization]] traditionally referring to the [[Middle Ages]], that asserts that a demographic, cultural, and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|quote=a term sometimes applied to the period of the Middle Ages to mark the intellectual darkness characteristic of the time; often restricted to the early period of the Middle Ages, between the time of the fall of Rome and the appearance of vernacular written documents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dark+age|title=Definition of DARK AGE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term employs traditional [[light versus darkness|light-versus-darkness]] imagery to contrast the era's "darkness" (lack of records) with earlier and later periods of "light" (abundance of records).&lt;ref name=Mommsen227228&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore E.| authorlink =Theodor Ernst Mommsen | title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–228 | publisher = [[Medieval Academy of America]] | location = Cambridge MA | year = 1942 | jstor = 2856364| doi = 10.2307/2856364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a "Dark Age" originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar [[Petrarch]], who regarded the post-Roman centuries as "dark" compared to the light of [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name=Mommsen227228/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Bard|title=Humanists and Reformers: A History of the Renaissance and Reformation|publisher=Erdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|year=1996|pages=13|isbn=978-0-8028-6348-5|quote=Petrarch was the very first to speak of the Middle Ages as a 'dark age', one that separated him from the riches and pleasures of classical antiquity and that broke the connection between his own age and the civilization of the Greeks and the Romans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "Dark Age" itself derives from the Latin ''[[saeculum obscurum]]'', originally applied by [[Caesar Baronius]] in 1602 to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, John C., ''Church history: twenty centuries of Catholic Christianity'', (1998) p. 155.&lt;br&gt;[[Baronius]], Caesar. ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'', Vol. X. Roma, 1602, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; The concept thus came to characterize the entire Middle Ages as a time of intellectual darkness between the fall of Rome and the [[Renaissance]]; this became especially popular during the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=Mommsen227228/&gt;

As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 18th and 20th centuries, scholars began restricting the "Dark Ages" appellation to the [[Early Middle Ages]] (c. 5th–10th century).&lt;ref name=Mommsen226227&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore E.| authorlink =Theodor Ernst Mommsen | title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–227| publisher = [[Medieval Academy of America]] | location = Cambridge MA | year = 1942 | jstor = 2856364| doi = 10.2307/2856364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ker, W.

In explaining his approach to writing the work, Snyder refers to the "so-called Dark Ages", noting that "Historians and archaeologists have never liked the label Dark Ages ... there are numerous indicators that these centuries were neither 'dark' nor 'barbarous' in comparison with other eras."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dmas&gt;[[William Chester Jordan|Jordan, Chester William]] (2004).

===Petrarch===
[[File:Tommaso.Laureti Triumph.of.Christianity.jpg|thumb|''Triumph of Christianity'' by [[Tommaso Laureti]] (1530&amp;ndash;1602), ceiling painting in the [[Raphael Rooms#Sala di Costantino|Sala di Constantino]], [[Vatican City|Vatican Palace]]. Images like this one celebrate the triumph of Christianity over the paganism of Antiquity.]]

The idea of a Dark Age originated with the Tuscan scholar [[Petrarch]] in the 1330s.&lt;ref name=mommsen&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore E.| authorlink =Theodor Ernst Mommsen | title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–242 | publisher = [[Medieval Academy of America]] | location = Cambridge MA | year = 1942 | jstor = 2856364| doi = 10.2307/2856364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Writing of the past, he said: "Amidst the errors there shone forth men of genius; no less keen were their eyes, although they were ''surrounded by darkness'' and dense gloom".&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] (1367). ''Apologia cuiusdam anonymi Galli calumnias'' (''Defence against the calumnies of an anonymous Frenchman''), in Petrarch, ''Opera Omnia'', Basel, 1554, p. 1195. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article, where the source is given in a footnote. Cf. also Marsh, D, ed., (2003), ''Invectives'', Harvard University Press, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]] writers, including Petrarch himself,&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; had long used traditional [[metaphor]]s of '[[light versus darkness]]' to describe '[[Good and evil|good versus evil]]'. Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor [[secularity|secular]] meaning by reversing its application. He now saw Classical Antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt;

From his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and classical period as an expression of greatness.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; He spent much of his time travelling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.

Petrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: "My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] (1343). ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', IX, 451-7. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, historians [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] developed a three-tier outline of history. They used Petrarch's two ages, plus a modern, 'better age', which they believed the world had entered. Later the term 'Middle Ages' - Latin ''media tempestas'' (1469) or  ''medium aevum'' (1604) - was used to describe the period of supposed decline.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;
Albrow, Martin, ''The global age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), p. 205.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, Protestants generally had a similar view to Renaissance Humanists such as Petrarch, but also added an [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic]] perspective. They saw classical antiquity as a golden time, not only because of its Latin literature, but also because it witnessed the beginnings of Christianity. They promoted the idea that the 'Middle Age' was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, such as:  Popes ruling as kings, veneration of [[Relic|saints' relics]], a licentious priesthood, and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;F. Oakley, ''The medieval experience: foundations of Western cultural singularity'' (University of Toronto Press, 1988), pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baronius=== 
In response to the Protestants, Catholics developed a counter-image to depict the [[High Middle Ages]] in particular as a period of social and religious harmony, and not 'dark' at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Daileader|Daileader, Philip]] (2001). ''The High Middle Ages''. The Teaching Company. {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}. "Catholics living during the Protestant Reformation were not going to take this assault lying down. They, too, turned to the study of the Middle Ages, going back to prove that, far from being a period of religious corruption, the Middle Ages were superior to the era of the Protestant Reformation, because the Middle Ages were free of the religious schisms and religious wars that were plaguing the 16th and 17th centuries."&lt;/ref&gt; The most important Catholic reply to the ''Magdeburg Centuries'' was the ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' by Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]]. Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as "far surpassing anything before"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as "the greatest history of the Church ever written".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906). ''[[s:Lectures on Modern History|Lectures on Modern History]]'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' covered the first twelve centuries of Christianity to 1198, and was published in twelve volumes between 1588 and 1607. It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term "dark age" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888&lt;ref&gt;Baronius's actual starting-point for the "dark age" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&amp;word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM ("Saeculum Obscurum")], have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the "lack of writers" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:

{{quote|"The new age (''saeculum'') which was beginning, for its harshness and barrenness of good could well be called iron, for its baseness and abounding evil leaden, and moreover for its lack of writers (''inopia scriptorum'') dark (''obscurum'')".&lt;ref&gt;[[Caesar Baronius|Baronius, Caesar]] (1602). ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'', Vol. X. Roma, p. 647. "Novum incohatur saeculum quod, sua asperitate ac boni sterilitate ferreum, malique exudantis deformitate plumbeum, atque inopia scriptorum, appellari consuevit obscurum."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Significantly, Baronius termed the age 'dark' because of the paucity of written records. The "lack of writers" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number containing the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.

[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500–1500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: "Charting the "Rise of the West": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–445 (416, table 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]

There is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a certain recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age', in Baronius's sense of a "lack of writers", between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of "lack of writers" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].

Baronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to proliferate in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.

The first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages' which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the "Epistle Dedicatory" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: "The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of "St George's fighting with the dragon" as "a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.

===Enlightenment===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them the Middle Ages, or "Age of Faith", was therefore the opposite of the [[Age of Reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). "Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World", in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. "Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Voltaire]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion, while [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the "rubbish of the Dark Ages".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a "new age", was criticising the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.

Consequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.

Nevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages', used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The earliest recorded use of the English word "medieval" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized "Dark Ages" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or alternatively to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.

===Romanticism===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a vogue for [[medievalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[Goths|Gothic]]" had been a term of opprobrium akin to "[[Vandal]]" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English "Goths" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an "Age of Faith". This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Alice K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.

Just as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was largely the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.

==Modern academic use==
{{See also|Medieval studies}}
The term was widely used by 19th-century historians. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; or at least its more pejorative use. The historian [[Denys Hay]] spoke ironically of "the lively centuries which we call dark".&lt;!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T. Hatto, and if correct, this would be the more original reference, but but pending a source we must be content with the Hay reference.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Denys Hay|Hay, Denys]] (1977). ''Annalists and Historians''. London: Methuen, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; More forcefully, a book about the [[history of German literature]] published in 2007 describes "the dark ages" as "a popular if ignorant manner of speaking".&lt;ref&gt;Dunphy, Graeme (2007). "Literary Transitions, 1300–1500: From Late Mediaeval to Early Modern" in: ''The Camden House History of German Literature'' vol IV: "Early Modern German Literature".  The chapter opens: "A popular if uninformed manner of speaking refers to the medieval period as "the dark ages." If there is a dark age in the literary history of Germany, however, it is the one that follows: the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the time between the Middle High German ''Blütezeit'' and the full blossoming of the Renaissance. It may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity."&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern historians do not use the term "dark ages", preferring terms such as [[Early Middle Ages]].  But when used by some historians today, the term "Dark Ages" is meant to describe the economic, political, and cultural problems of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Review Article: Travel and Trade in the Dark Ages, Treadgold, Warren, Journal
The International History Review Volume 26, 2004 - Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Globalisation, Ecological Crisis, and Dark Ages, Sing C. Chew, Journal of Global Society,Volume 16, 2002 - Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;  For others, the term Dark Ages is intended to be neutral, expressing the idea that the events of the period seem 'dark' to us because of the paucity of the [[Recorded history|historical record]].&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; The term is used in this sense (often in the singular) to reference the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and the subsequent [[Greek Dark Ages]],&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; the [[dark ages of Cambodia]] (c. 1450-1863), and also a hypothetical [[Digital Dark Age]] which would ensue if the [[electronic document]]s produced in the current period were to become unreadable at some point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081027174646 'Digital Dark Age' May Doom Some Data], ''[[Science Daily]]'', October 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Byzantinist]]s have used the term "Byzantine Dark Ages" to refer to the period from the earliest [[Muslim conquests]] to about 800,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Lemerle|Lemerle, Paul]] (1986). ''Byzantine Humanism'', translated by Helen Lindsay and Ann Moffat. Canberra, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; because there are no extant historical texts in Greek from this period, and thus the history of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and its territories that were conquered by the Muslims is poorly understood and must be reconstructed from other contemporaneous sources, such as religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Whitby|Whitby, Michael]] (1992). "Greek historical writing after Procopius" in ''Byzantine and Early Islamic Near East'', ed. Averil Cameron and Lawrence I. Conrad, Princeton, pp. 25–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lemerle, Paul (1986). ''Byzantine Humanism'', translated by Helen Lindsay and Ann Moffat. Canberra, p. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "dark age" is not restricted to the discipline of history. Since the archaeological evidence for some periods is abundant and for others scanty, there are also archaeological dark ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onderzoekinformatie.nl/en/oi/nod/onderzoek/OND1320349/ Project: Exploring the Early Holocene Occupation of North-Central Anatolia: New Approaches for Studying Archaeological Dark Ages] Period of Project: 09/2007-09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Late Middle Ages]] significantly overlap with the [[Renaissance]], the term 'Dark Ages' has become restricted to distinct times and places in medieval Europe. Thus the 5th and 6th centuries in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], at the height of the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invasions, have been called "the darkest of the Dark Ages",&lt;ref&gt;[[John Cannon (historian)|Cannon, John]] and Griffiths, Ralph (2000). ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy (Oxford Illustrated Histories)'', 2nd Revised edition. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, p. 1. The first chapter opens with the sentence: "In the darkest of the Dark Ages, the fifth and sixth centuries, there were many kings in Britain but no kingdoms."&lt;/ref&gt; in view of the [[societal collapse]] of the period and the consequent lack of historical records. Further south and east, the same was true in the formerly Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], where history after the Roman withdrawal went unrecorded for centuries as [[Slavs]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], and others struggled for supremacy in the [[Danube]] basin, and events there are still disputed. However, at this time the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arab Empire]] is often considered to have experienced its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify a geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

However, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term in a neutral way: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so. Secondly, 20th-century scholarship had increased understanding of the history and culture of the period,&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Martin (1993). ''[http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-00894-6.html Discovering Anglo-Saxon England]''. University Park, PA: Penn State Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to such an extent that it is no longer really 'dark' to us.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians now avoid it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151663/Dark-Ages Encyclopædia Britannica] "It is now rarely used by historians because of the value judgment it implies. Though sometimes taken to derive its meaning from the fact that little was then known about the period, the term's more usual and pejorative sense is of a period of intellectual darkness and barbarity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire (The Princeton History of the Ancient World) |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Kyle Harper |year=2017 |page=12 |quote=These used to be called the Dark Ages. That label is best set aside. It is hopelessly redolent of Renaissance and Enlightenment prejudices. It altogether underestimates the impressive cultural vitality and enduring spiritual legacy of the entire period that has come to be known as "late antiquity". At the same time we do not have to [[wikt:euphemize|euphemize]] the realities of imperial disintegration, economic collapse and societal disintegration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern popular use==
[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42 - miniature.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval artistic illustration of the [[spherical Earth]] in a 14th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'' (c. 1246)]]
Science historian [[David C. Lindberg]] criticised the public use of 'dark ages' to describe the entire Middle Ages as "a time of [[ignorance]], [[Barbarian|barbarism]] and [[superstition]]" for which "blame is most often laid at the feet of the [[Christian Church|Christian church]], which is alleged to have placed religious authority over personal experience and rational activity".&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, "The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor", in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science [[Edward Grant]] writes that "If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], they were made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant. ''God and Reason in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge 2001, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lindberg says that, contrary to common belief, "the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in the essay of Ted Peters about Science and Religion at "Lindsay Jones (editor in chief). Encyclopedia of Religion, Second Edition. Thomson Gale. 2005. p.8182"&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] due to the [[Migration Period]] a lot of classical Greek texts were lost there, but part of these texts survived and they were studied widely in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Around the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the [[High Middle Ages]] stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored after the invasions of [[Vikings]] and [[Hungarians|Magyars]]; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population. And the rejuvenation of science and scholarship in the West was due in large part to the new availability of Latin translations of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, D. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''  Chicago. University of Chicago Press. p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view of the period is reflected by more specific notions such as the 19th-century claim&lt;ref name=bunk&gt;Historian [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], in his book ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth]]'' "... shows how nineteenth-century anti-Christians invented and spread the falsehood that educated people in the Middle Ages believed that the earth was flat" [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html Russell's summary of his book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;{{Cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2149">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Dindymon'''&lt;ref&gt;Rarely '''Dindymus''', as in [[Pliny's Natural History]] V.142 and [[Sextus Propertius]], III.22.3.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|n|d|ə|ˌ|m|ɒ|n}} ({{lang-grc|Δίνδυμον}}), was a mountain in eastern [[Phrygia]] (today's [[Murat Dağı]] of [[Gediz, Kütahya|Gediz]]), later part of [[Galatia]], that was later called [[Agdistis]], sacred to the "mountain mother", [[Cybele]], whom the Hellenes knew as [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. [[Strabo]] sited Dindymon above [[Pessinos]], sacred to Cybele.

A Mount Dindymon might also be placed on the peninsula of [[Cyzicus]] facing the [[Sea of Marmara]], as in [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'', or by [[Stephanus Byzantinicus]] further south, in the [[Troad]], thus near [[Mount Ida]]. ''[[Argonautica]]'' book I sets a scene at Mount Dindymon, where [[Jason]] placates the goddess of the mountain, "the mother of all the blessed gods, where she sits enthroned".&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius of Rhodes (Peter Green, tr.), ''Argonautika'', expanded ed. 2007, book I.1093-94.&lt;/ref&gt; identified as "Dindymene [Δινδυμηνή] the mother, Lady of many names,"&lt;ref&gt;''Argonautika''  I.1125&lt;/ref&gt; among which was [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]].&lt;ref&gt;(Apollonius of Rhodes), Richard Hunter, tr., 1993. ''Jason and the Golden Fleece'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press), Book I, p. 29f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various applications of Dindymon, as the mountain of the Anatolian [[Mother Goddess]], the "Mountain Mother", is explained by Robinson Ellis:&lt;ref&gt;Robinson Ellis, 1876. ''A Commentary on Catullus'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press), Catullus LXIII.91 (p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt; "The name Dindymenian mother would in the first instance no doubt be connected with the earliest seat of the worship, the Phrygian Dindymon, but as soon as the worship spread farther and the name of Dindymon with it, the Goddess of Dindymon would lose its original definiteness and be variously applied by different writers."

'''Docomomo International''' (sometimes written as '''DoCoMoMo''' or simply '''Docomomo''') is a non-profit organization whose full title is '''International Committee for Documentation and Conservation of Buildings, Sites and Neighbourhoods of the Modern Movement'''.

Mrinalini Rajagopalan, author of "Preservation and Modernity: Competing Perspectives, Contested Histories and the Question of Authenticity," described it as "the key body for the preservation of modernist architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n354cBry_6EC&amp;pg=PA324|title=The SAGE Handbook of Architectural Theory|date=2012|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=9781446282632|edition=paperback|location=|page=324|chapter=Preservation and Modernity: Competing Perspectives, Contested Histories and the Question of Authenticity|quote=|via=|last1=Rajagopalan|first1=Mrinalini|editor1-last=Crysler|editor1-first=C. Greig|editor2-last=Cairns|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Heynen|editor3-first=Hilde|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Its foundation was inspired by the work of ICOMOS, the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], established in 1965. The work of Icomos was concerned with the protection and conservation of historical buildings and sites, whereas Docomomo was founded to take up the challenge of the protection and conservation of [[Modern Architecture]] and [[Urbanism]].

Docomomo International was founded in [[Eindhoven]] in 1988 by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] architects [[Hubert-Jan Henket]] and Wessel de Jonge. Henket chaired Docomomo International with de Jonge as secretary until September 2000 when the International Secretariat relocated to Paris, where it was hosted by the [[Cité de l’Architecture et du Patrimoine]], in the [[Palais de Chaillot]]. The chair was Maristella Casciato, architect and architectural historian; with Émilie d'Orgeix, architectural historian, as secretary and Anne-Laure Guillet as director.

In 2008 there were 2,000 individual members. That year, 49 countries had national chapters and working parties of Docomomo. In 2010, the International Secretariat was relocated to Barcelona, hosted by the Fundació Mies van der Rohe. Ana Tostoes, architect and architect historian, chairs Docomomo International with Ivan Blasi, architect, as secretary. In 2014 the secretariat was transferred to the Instituto Superior Técnico at Lisbon, Portugal. Professor Tostoes remained as chair, with Zara Ferreira as secretary.

==Conferences and seminars==
Docomomo holds biennial international conferences where the people related to conservation issues gather and exchange information and studies pertaining to their scholarly research. The list of conferences held until now is as follows:

*1990 - Eindhoven, The Netherlands
*1992 - Bauhaus Dessau, Germany
*1994 - Barcelona, Spain
*1996 - Bratislava and Sliac, Slovakia
*1998 - Stockholm, Sweden
*2000 - Brasília, Brazil
*2002 - Paris, France
*2004 - New York, United States
*2006 - Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey
*2008 - Rotterdam, The Netherlands
*2010 - Mexico City, Mexico
*2012 - Espoo, Finland
*2014 - Seoul, South Korea
*2016 - Lisbon, Portugal

The International Scientific Committee on Technology (ISC/T) organizes seminars covering the following themes: restoration of reinforced concrete structures, curtain-wall facades, windows and glass, wood and the modern movement, colours in modern architecture and stone in modern buildings.

Seminars and conferences are often held in key modernist buildings, as for instance at [[Alvar Aalto]]’s [[Vyborg Library]] (2003 ISC/T seminar), Brinkman and [[Leendert van der Vlugt]]'s Van Nelle factory in [[Rotterdam]] (2008 Conference), and Gordon Bunshaft's [[Lever House]] in New York (closing party at 2004 Conference).

==Publications==
The ''Docomomo Journal'' is published twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, James P. and Evans Yankopolus, Jennifer, "Docomomo." ''Almanac of Architecture &amp; Design 2006''. Greenway Communications, November 1, 2005. {{ISBN|0975565427}}, 9780975565421. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh7ecV24_uAC&amp;pg=PA426 426].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work at national level==
Many countries have national Docomomo working parties, as either part of academic establishments or architecture federations. They may define gazetteers of important structures to be protected, such as [[DoCoMoMo Key Scottish Monuments]] and DoCoMoMo Architectural Masterpieces of Finnish Modernism,&lt;ref&gt;''DoCoMoMo Architectural Masterpieces of Finnish Modernism'', Maija Kairamo et al. (eds.), Helsinki: docomomo Suomi-Finland, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; or support local campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/07/18/why-we-have-to-protect-our-modern-buildings-91466-24172488/ Why we have to protect our modern buildings], ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', 18 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation work by Docomomo together with others was recognised by the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] after a 2009 [[charrette]] to protect the former [[Bell Labs Holmdel Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;"Bell Labs charrette recognized by state", ''Greater Media Newspapers'', June 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dynasty''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɪ|n|ə|s|t|i}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|d|aɪ|n|ə|s|t|i}}) is a sequence of rulers from the same family,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "dynasty, ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; usually in the context of a [[feudalism|feudal]] or [[monarch]]ical system, but sometimes also appearing in [[election|elective]] [[republic]]s. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a "noble house",&lt;ref name=OED2&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', {{nowrap|3rd ed.}} "house, ''n.¹'' and ''int'', {{nowrap|10. b.}}" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which may be [[style (manner of address)|styled]] as "[[royal family|royal]]", "[[prince]]ly", "[[duke|ducal]]", "[[count|comital]]", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. [[Historian]]s [[periodization|periodize]] the histories of many [[sovereign state]]s, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Carolingian Empire]] and [[Imperial China]], using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term "dynasty" may be used to delimit the [[era]] during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period ("a [[Ming vase|Ming-dynasty]] vase"). The word "dynasty" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references ("a [[Ming vase]]").

Until the 19th century, it was taken for granted that a legitimate function of a [[monarch]] was to aggrandize his dynasty: that is, to increase the [[territory (administrative division)|territory]], wealth, and power of his family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Thomson| first = David| title = Europe Since Napoleon| year = 1961| publisher = Knopf| location = New York| pages = 79–80| chapter = The Institutions of Monarchy| quote = The basic idea of monarchy was the idea that hereditary right gave the best title to political power...The dangers of disputed succession were best avoided by hereditary succession: ruling families had a natural interest in passing on to their descendants enhanced power and prestige...Frederick the Great of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, Maria Theresa of Austria, were alike infatuated with the idea of strengthening their power, centralizing government in their own hands as against local and feudal privileges, and so acquiring more absolute authority in the state. Moreover, the very dynastic rivalries and conflicts between these eighteenth-century monarchs drove them to look for ever more efficient methods of government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest-surviving dynasty in the world is the [[Imperial House of Japan]], otherwise known as the Yamato dynasty, whose reign is traditionally dated to {{nowrap|660 BC}}.

Prior to the 20th century, dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned [[patrilineality|patrilineally]], such as under the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Salic law]]. In nations where it was permitted, succession through a daughter usually established a new dynasty in her husband's ruling house. This has changed in some places in Europe, where [[succession law]] and convention have maintained dynasties ''[[de jure]]'' through a female. For example, the [[House of Windsor]] is maintained through the children of Queen [[Elizabeth II]], similarly with the [[monarchy of the Netherlands]], whose dynasty remained the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] through three successive queens regnant. The earliest such example among the major European monarchies was in Russia in the 18th century, where the name of the [[House of Romanov]] was maintained through [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia|a non-ruling female]].

In South Africa's Limpopo Province, [[Rain Queen|Balobedu]] determined descent [[matrilineal succession|matrilineally]], while rulers have at other times adopted the name of their mother's dynasty when coming into her inheritance. Less frequently, a monarchy has alternated or been rotated, in a multidynastic (or polydynastic) system – that is, the most senior living members of parallel dynasties, at any point in time, constitute the line of succession.

Not all feudal states or monarchies were/are ruled by a dynasty. Modern examples are the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] and [[Andorra|Principality of Andorra]]. Throughout history, there were monarchs that did not belong to any dynasty. Non-dynastic rulers include [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], [[Arioald]] of the [[Lombards]], and [[Phocas]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

The word "dynasty" is sometimes used informally for people who are not rulers but are, for example, members of a family with influence and power in other areas, such as a series of successive owners of a major company. It is also extended to unrelated people, such as major poets of the same school or various rosters of a single sports team.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "dynasty" derives from Latin ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|dynastia}}}}'', which comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''dynastéia'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|δυναστεία}}}}), where it referred to "power", "dominion", and "rule" itself.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. ''A Greek–English Lexicon'': "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddunastei%2Fa {{lang|grc|δυναστεία}}]". Hosted by Tufts University's Perseus Project.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the abstract noun of ''dynástēs'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|δυνάστης}}}}),&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. ''A Greek–English Lexicon'': "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dduna%2Fsths {{lang|grc|δυνάστης}}]".&lt;/ref&gt; the agent noun of ''dynamis'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|δύναμις}}}}), "power" or "ability",&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. ''A Greek–English Lexicon'': "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddu%2Fnamis {{lang|grc|δύναμις}}]".&lt;/ref&gt; from ''dýnamai'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|δύναμαι}}}}), "to be able".&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddu%2Fnamai {{lang|grc|δύναμαι}}]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynasts==
A ruler in a dynasty is sometimes referred to as a "dynast", but this term is also used to describe any member of a reigning family who retains a right to [[order of succession|succeed]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; to a throne. For example, following his abdication, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]] ceased to be a dynastic member of the [[House of Windsor]].

A "dynastic marriage" is one that complies with monarchical [[house law]] restrictions, so that the descendants are eligible to inherit the throne or other [[monarchy|royal]] privileges. The marriage of [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange]], to [[Máxima Zorreguieta]] in 2002 was dynastic, for example, and their [[Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands|eldest child]] is expected to inherit the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] crown eventually. But the marriage of his younger brother [[Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau|Prince Friso]] to [[Mabel Wisse Smit]] in 2003 lacked government support and [[parliamentary]] approval. Thus Friso forfeited his place in the [[order of succession]], lost his title as a ''Prince of the Netherlands'', and left his children without dynastic rights.

In historical and [[monarchy|monarchist]] references to formerly reigning families, a "dynast" is a family member who would have had succession rights, were the monarchy's rules still in force. For example, after the 1914 assassinations of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] and his [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie von Hohenberg]], their son [[Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg|Max]] was bypassed for the Austrian throne because he was not a [[Habsburg]] dynast. Even since abolition of the Austrian monarchy, Max and his descendants have not been considered the rightful [[pretender]]s by Austrian monarchists, nor have they claimed that position.

The term "dynast" is sometimes used only to refer to [[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|agnatic]] descendants of a [[realm]]'s monarchs, and sometimes to include those who hold succession rights through [[matrilineality|cognatic]] royal descent. The term can therefore describe overlapping but distinct sets of people. For example, [[David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon]], a nephew of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] through her sister, [[Princess Margaret of the United Kingdom|Princess Margaret]], is in the line of succession to the British crown: in that sense he is a British dynast. Yet he is not a [[patrilineality|male-line]] member of the [[royal family]], and is therefore not a dynast of the House of Windsor.

On the other hand, the German [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] [[Prince Ernst August of Hanover (born 1954)]], a male-line descendant of [[George III of the United Kingdom]], possesses no legal British name, titles or styles (although he is entitled to re-claim the once-[[duke#Royal dukes|royal dukedom]] of [[Duke of Cumberland|Cumberland]]), was born in the [[order of succession|line of succession]] to the British crown and was bound by Britain's [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] until it was repealed when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] took effect on 26 March 2015.&lt;ref name=inforce&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2015-03-26/HCWS490/ Statement by Nick Clegg MP, UK parliament website], 26 March 2015 (retrieved on same date).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1999 he requested and obtained formal permission from Elizabeth II to marry the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline of Monaco]]. Yet a clause of the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]] remained in effect at that time, stipulating that dynasts who marry Roman Catholics are considered "dead" for the purpose of succession to the throne.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4426171.stm | title=Monaco royal taken seriously ill | work=[[BBC News]] | date=8 April 2005 | accessdate=January 27, 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; That exclusion, too, ceased to apply on 26 March 2015, with retroactive effect for those who had been dynasts prior to triggering it by marriage to a Catholic.&lt;ref name=inforce/&gt;

==List of dynasties by region==
Some dynasties appear more than once in this list, because:
* more than one political entity was/is ruled by a single dynasty (for example, the [[House of Windsor]] is the ruling dynasty of [[Commonwealth realm|16 sovereign states]]); or
* a single political entity ruled by a dynasty spanned/spans across more than one geographical region (for example, the [[Tang dynasty]] ruled over [[China proper]], the northern portions of the [[Korean Peninsula]] and Vietnam, as well as parts of [[Central Asia]], the [[Mongolian Plateau]] and [[Siberia]]).

The '''Georgian Group''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Charitable organization|charity]], and the national authority on [[Georgian architecture]] built between 1700 and 1837 in England and Wales. As one of the [[Amenity society|National Amenity Societies]], the Georgian Group is a statutory consultee on alterations to [[Listed Building|listed buildings]], and by law must be notified of any work to a relevant listed building which involves any element of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=Gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1937 by Lord Derwent, [[Robert Byron]] and the journalist [[Douglas Goldring]] (who went on to become the first secretary), the Group was originally part of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]]. Sir [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], the [[poet]] and [[author]] [[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]], [[John Summerson|Sir John Summerson]], [[Robert Byron]], the [[architect]] Sir [[Albert Richardson]], [[Oliver Messel]], and Sir [[Osbert Sitwell]] were among its most prominent early active members. Since 1971, the Georgian Group has been a national [[amenity society]]. 

== Work ==

The Georgian Group acts as a statutory consultee in the planning process in England and Wales, when consideration is being given to proposals to alter or demolish [[listed building]]s dating, in whole or in part, from between 1700 and 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |title=Arrangements for handling heritage applications Direction 2015 |publisher=www.gov.uk |date=24 March 2015 |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-handling-heritage-applications-direction-2015 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victorian Society]] plays a similar role for buildings built between 1837 and 1914. It is notified of many thousands of applications each year. (In [[Scotland]] the [[Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland]], formerly the Georgian Group of Edinburgh, is now the relevant statutory consultee). 

The Group has a similar role in the [[Church of England]] and [[Church in Wales]] faculty systems, and also advises the internal planning bodies of the [[Methodist]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Baptist]] and [[United Reformed Church]], on alterations to listed churches and chapels, including on the re-ordering or removal of historic fixtures and fittings.

In 2002 the Georgian Group introduced its annual awards which are aimed at recognizing exemplary conservation and restoration projects in the [[United Kingdom]]. An award is also given for high quality new buildings in a Georgian context.  

Its present headquarters is at 6 [[Fitzroy Square]], [[London]] W1, a large [[Robert Adam]] town house which it has restored. Its extensive library and an important collection of architectural watercolours and engravings, the Pardoe Collection, are housed within its headquarters and are available for public examination by appointment.  

Since the early 1980s the Georgian Group has employed specialist regional caseworkers to undertake its advisory work within the planning process. Any member of the public can ask the Group for assistance in preventing the destruction of a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building, although the Group's resources are limited. There are four casework regions: London and the South East, Central and Northern England, South West England and the Cotswolds, and Wales. The caseworkers are responsible to a Senior Caseworker and a committee of expert advisers. Recent senior caseworkers have included Clare Campbell MA, Andrew Martindale BA, and John Neale MA IHBC. Dr [[John Martin Robinson]] FSA was the founder of its specialist Casework Committee a group of architects, architectural historians and conservation professionals who regularly meet to discuss controversial development schemes. Its present (2017) Chairman is the architect Peregrine Bryant MA DipArch(Cantab) RIBA. The Georgian Group also has specialist representatives on conservation advisory panels in many English local authority areas including [[Brighton]], [[Derby]], [[Bristol]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

The Group also publishes works on the care and restoration of Georgian buildings and interiors.

The Georgian Group's small grants fund for the repair and restoration of Georgian buildings, monuments and fixtures and fittings is called the F. E. Cleary Heritage Fund (commonly known as The Cleary Fund). Grants are normally awarded annually in October.

The present (2017) Chairman is Christopher Boyle QC, who is restoring a large derelict listed country house in Cumbria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8118">The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was a state agency in Florida that participated in the restoration and preservation of St. Augustine, Florida from 1959-1997.
== Overview ==
[[File:HSAPB logo.jpg|thumb|HSAPB logo]]
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board (HSAPB) was a seven-member state commission, created by [[LeRoy Collins|Governor LeRoy Collins]] in 1959 "to acquire, restore, preserve, maintain, reconstruct, reproduce, and operate" historic structures in the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. The HSAPB set out to restore and reconstruct Spanish colonial era buildings in a focused area of downtown St. Augustine in anticipation of the city's Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965, and maintained a research library of documentary evidence to support their preservation and interpretation efforts. The HSAPB was sundowned by the ''State of Florida'' in June 1997.

== St. Augustine Restoration and Preservation Commission ==
In March 1958, a group from St. Augustine made a presentation to Governor LeRoy Collins to propose a [[historic preservation]] program for the city’s historic downtown. House Bill 774 was signed into law on June 11, 1959, establishing the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/FlaStat/FlaStat1959/vol1/FlaStat1959v1OCR_Part24.pdf|title=Florida Statutes, 1959, Chapter 266: St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=1959|website=Florida State University College of Law Research Center|publisher=State of Florida|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill also granted $150,000 of state funds to begin their work. The primary objective of their program was to recreate [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish colonial architecture]] and culture of St. Augustine during the period of 1565 to 1821 in advance of the city’s Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965. The buildings restored and reconstructed represent structures of the [[History of Florida|First Spanish Period]] (to 1763), British Period (1763-83), Second Spanish Period (1783-1821, and the early American Period (after 1821).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide Book|last=Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board|first=|publisher=Division of Cultural Affairs, Department of State, State of Florida|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=5-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original members of the Commission included H.E. Wolfe, Leonard Usina, William F. Rolleston, William L. Sims, II, and Henrietta Poynter. Wolfe, a resident of St. Augustine, was the Commission’s first chairman. The Commission hired consultant Earle Newton to help them develop a strategic plan for restoration and preservation, and soon began historical and archaeological research for the properties they proposed to restore.

The Commission’s first restoration project was the Arrivas House on St. George Street. Then-Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] visited St. Augustine on March 11, 1963 to dedicate the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Big Day in St. Augustine|last=|first=|date=March 12, 1963|work=The Florida Times-Union|access-date=|location=Jacksonville, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission used the second floor of the Arrivas House as their administrative offices until 1970, when they moved operations to [[Government House (St. Augustine)|Government House]].

== San Agustín Antiguo ==
The Commission opened a [[Living museum|living history museum village]] in its restored area in 1963, calling it San Agustín Antiguo. Costumed interpreters gave tours of restored buildings and demonstrated a variety of arts and crafts typical of the First and Second Spanish Periods, as well as of the British Period. These included [[Blacksmithing|blacksmithing,]] [[weaving]], [[printing]], [[History of candle making|candle dipping]], [[silversmithing]], [[pottery]], [[baking]], and [[Leather|leather making]]. Today a portion of the original museum village still demonstrates early Spanish life in St. Augustine at the [[Colonial Quarter]].

== Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board ==
On May 5, 1970, the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission was renamed the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board, enacted by Florida Statute Section 266.01-07.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/FlaStat/FlaStat1970/vsupp/FlaStat1970Supp_OCR_Part4.pdf|title=Florida Statutes 1970, Chapter 266.01: Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board of Trustees, creation.|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=1970|website=Florida State University School of Law Research Center|publisher=State of Florida.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board continued to fulfill their mission until 1997.

== Sundown and Aftermath ==
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was abolished by the State of Florida in June 1997 in accordance with the [[Sunset provision|Sundown Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=preservation+board&amp;URL=Ch0267/Sec171.HTM|title=Florida Statute Title XVII, Chapter 267.171|last=Florida Legislature|first=|date=|website=Online Sunshine: The Official Internet Site of the Florida Legislature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the City of St. Augustine took over management of the historic properties. Today, the legacy of the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board lives on through [[University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc.|UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc.]] (UFHSA), a direct support organization of the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://staugustine.ufl.edu/governance.html|title=UF Historic St. Augustine Governance|last=|first=|date=10/25/2018|website=UF Historic St. Augustine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11/13/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the properties restored or reconstructed by the Board are owned by the State of Florida and managed by UFHSA on its behalf. The remaining records and research materials of the Board are held at Governor’s House Library in Government House Cultural Center and Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/govhouse/Index.aspx|title=Governor's House Library|last=University of Florida|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historical materialism''' is the [[Historical method|methodological approach]] of [[Marxist historiography]] that focuses on human [[societies]] and their development over time, claiming that they follow a number of observable tendencies. This was first articulated by [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) as the ''materialist conception of history''. It is principally a theory of [[history]] according to which the material conditions of a society's way of producing and reproducing the means of human existence or, in Marxist terms, the union of its [[productive forces|technological and productive capacity]] and social [[relations of production]], fundamentally determine society's organization and development.

Historical materialism{{efn|[[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman|Edwin R.&amp;nbsp;A. Seligman]] wrote:

{{quote|This doctrine is often called "historical materialism," or the "materialistic interpretation of history." Such terms are, however, lacking in precision. If by materialism is meant the tracing of all changes to material causes, the biological view of history is also materialistic. Again, the theory which ascribes all changes in society to the influence of climate or to the character of the fauna and flora is materialistic, and yet has little in common with the doctrine here discussed. The doctrine we have to deal with is not only materialistic, but also economic in character; and the better phrase is not the "materialistic interpretation," but the "economic interpretation" of history.{{sfn|Seligman|1901|p=613}}}}}} looks for the causes of developments and changes in human society in the means by which humans collectively produce the necessities of life. It posits that social classes and the relationship between them, along with the political structures and ways of thinking in society, are founded on and reflect contemporary economic activity.{{sfn|Fromm|1961}}

Since Marx's time, the theory has been modified and expanded by Marxist writers. It now has many Marxist and non-Marxist variants. Marxists contest that historical materialism is a [[scientific]] approach to the study of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Woods |first=Alan |year=2016 |title=What Is Historical Materialism? |url=http://www.marxist.com/an-introduction-to-historical-materialism.htm |website=In Defence of Marxism |publisher=International Marxist Tendency |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and development ==
While Marx never used the words "historical materialism" to describe his theory of history, it nevertheless first appears in [[Friedrich Engels]]' 1880 work ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://marxists.catbull.com/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm |title= Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |author= Friedrich Engels |website=marxists.org |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Marx wrote an introduction for the French edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://marxists.catbull.com/archive/marx/works/1880/05/04.htm |title=Introduction to the French Edition of Engels' ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' |author=Karl Marx |website=marxists.org |publisher= Marxists Internet Archive| access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1892, Friedrich Engels indicated that he accepted the broader usage of the term "historical materialism," writing in an introduction to ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific;'' 

{{quotation|I am perfectly aware that the contents of this work will meet with objection from a considerable portion of the British public. But, if we Continentals had taken the slightest notice of the prejudices of British "respectability", we should be even worse off than we are. This book defends what we call "historical materialism", and the word materialism grates upon the ears of the immense majority of British readers... I hope even British respectability will not be overshocked if I use, in English as well as in so many other languages, the term "historical materialism", to designate that view of the course of history which seeks the ultimate cause and the great moving power of all important historic events in the economic development of society, in the changes in the modes of production and exchange, in the consequent division of society into distinct classes, and in the struggles of these classes against one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frederick Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/int-mat.htm |title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Introduction - Materialism) |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx's initial interest in materialism is evident in [[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature|his doctoral thesis]], which compared the philosophical [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] with the [[materialism|materialist]] philosophy of [[Epicurus]]&lt;ref name="Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/ |title=Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University |access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Foster|1999}}, as well as his close reading of [[Adam Smith]] and other writers in classical [[political economy]].

[[File:MaxStirner2.svg|thumb|150px|A caricature of [[Max Stirner]] drawn by Friedrich Engels. Stirner's 1844 work ''[[The Ego and Its Own|The Unique and its Property]]'' prompted Marx to theorize a scientific approach to the study of history, which he first laid out in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845) along with a lengthy rebuttal of Stirner's work.]]

Marx and Engels first state and detail their materialist conception of history within the pages of ''[[The German Ideology]]'', written in 1845. The book, which [[Structural Marxism|structural Marxists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Althusser |first=Louis |title=For Marx |publisher= The Penguin Press |date=1969 |page=59 |url=http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/FM65NB.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard as Marx's [[Young Marx#Various breaks|first 'mature' work]], is a lengthy polemic against Marx and Engels' fellow [[Young Hegelians]] and contemporaries [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], and [[Max Stirner]]. Stirner's 1844 work ''[[The Ego and its Own|The Unique and its Property]]'' had a particularly strong impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/max-stirner/ |title=Max Stirner (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University |access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the worldview of Marx and Engels: Stirner's blistering critique of [[morality]] and whole-hearted embrace of [[egoism]] prompted the pair to formulate a conception of [[socialism]] along lines of [[self-interest]] rather than simple [[humanism]] alone, grounding that conception in the scientific study of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Welsh |first=John F. |title=Max Stirner's Dialectical Egoism, A new interpretation |pages=20–23 |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perhaps Marx's clearest formulation of historical materialism resides in the preface to his 1859 book ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely [[relations of production]] appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of [[political consciousness|consciousness]]. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or&amp;nbsp;– this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms&amp;nbsp;– with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure. In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic&amp;nbsp;– in short, [[ideological]] forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an [[individual]] by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production.{{sfn|Marx|1977}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Continued development===

In a foreword to his essay ''Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical'' ''German Philosophy'' (1886), three years after Marx's death, Engels claimed confidently that "the Marxist world outlook has found representatives far beyond the boundaries of Germany and Europe and in all the literary languages of the world."{{sfn|Engels|1946}} Indeed, in the years after Marx and Engels' deaths, "historical materialism" was identified as a distinct philosophical doctrine and was subsequently elaborated upon and systematized by [[Orthodox Marxism|Orthodox Marxist]] and [[Marxist-Leninist]] thinkers such as [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Karl Kautsky]], [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. This occurred despite the fact that many of Marx's earlier works on historical materialism, including ''The German Ideology'', remained unpublished until the 1930's; in reality, most self-styled Marxists had not read beyond Capital Vol. 1. 

In the early years of the 20th century, historical materialism was often treated by socialist writers as interchangeable with [[dialectical materialism]], a formulation never used by Marx or Engels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch02.htm|title=Marx's Conception of Man |author= [[Erich Fromm]] |publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to many Marxists influenced by Soviet Marxism, historical materialism is a specifically [[sociology|sociological]] method, while dialectical materialism refers to the more general, abstract [[philosophy]] underlying Marx and Engels' body of work. This view is based on [[Joseph Stalin]]'s pamphlet ''[[Dialectical and Historical Materialism]]'', as well as textbooks issued by the [[Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute|Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm |title= Dialectical and Historical Materialism |author= [[Joseph Stalin]] |website=marxists.org |publisher= Marxists Internet Archive| access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The formalist vs substantivist debate|substantivist]] [[ethnography|ethnographic]] approach of economic [[economic anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[economic sociology|sociologist]] [[Karl Polanyi]] bears similarities to historical materialism. Polanyi distinguishes between the ''formal'' definition of economics as the logic of rational choice between limited resources and a ''substantive'' definition of economics as the way humans make their living from their natural and social environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Polanyi, K.|title=The Great Transformation | location=New York|year=1944| pages=44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]]'' (1944), Polanyi asserts that both the formal and substantive definitions of economics hold true under capitalism, but that the formal definition falls short when analyzing the economic behavior of pre-industrial societies, whose behavior was more often governed by redistribution and [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ibid. |pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Polanyi was influenced by Marx, he rejected the primacy of [[economic determinism]] in shaping the course of history, arguing that rather than being a realm unto itself, an economy is [[Embeddedness|embedded]] within its contemporary social institutions, such as the [[State (polity)|state]] in the case of the market economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hann |first=Chris |title=Economic Anthropology (The International Encyclopedia of Anthropology) |pages = 1–16|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2018 |date=2017-09-29|doi=10.1002/9781118924396.wbiea2194 |chapter = Economic Anthropology|isbn = 9780470657225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable recent exploration of historical materialism is [[G.&amp;nbsp;A. Cohen]]'s ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'',{{sfn|Cohen|2000}} which inaugurated the school of [[Analytical Marxism]]. Cohen advances a sophisticated technological-determinist interpretation of Marx "in which history is, fundamentally, the growth of human productive power, and forms of society rise and fall according as they enable or impede that growth."&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Cohen, ''Karl Marx’s Theory of History'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several scholars have argued that historical materialism ought to be revised in the light of modern scientific knowledge. [[Jürgen Habermas]] believes historical materialism "needs revision in many respects", especially because it has ignored the significance of [[communicative action]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Göran Therborn]] has argued that the method of historical materialism should be applied to historical materialism as intellectual tradition, and to the history of Marxism itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Class and Society: on the formation of Sociology and Historical Materialism |last= Therborn |first=Göran |publisher= London: Verso Books |date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Paul Hirst]] and [[Barry Hindess]] elaborated a [[structural Marxism|structural Marxist]] interpretation of historical materialism.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

 | quote  = In the Marxian view, human history is like a river. From any given vantage point, a river looks much the same day after day. But actually it is constantly flowing and changing, crumbling its banks, widening and deepening its channel. The water seen one day is never the same as that seen the next. Some of it is constantly being evaporated and drawn up, to return as rain. From year to year these changes may be scarcely perceptible. But one day, when the banks are thoroughly weakened and the rains long and heavy, the river floods, bursts its banks, and may take a new course. This represents the dialectical part of Marx's famous theory of [[dialectical materialism|dialectical]] (or historical) materialism.

Historical materialism builds upon the idea of historical [[progress]] that became popular in philosophy during [[the Enlightenment]], which contends that the development of human society has progressed through a series of stages, from [[hunting and gathering society|hunting and gathering]], through [[pastoralism]] and cultivation, to commercial society.{{sfn|Meek|1976}} Historical materialism rests on a foundation of metaphysical or philosophical [[materialism]], in which matter is considered primary and ideas, thought, and consciousness are secondary, i.e. consciousness and human ideas about the universe result from material conditions rather than vice versa.

Historical materialism springs from a fundamental underlying reality of human existence: that in order for human beings to survive and continue existence from generation to generation, it is necessary for them to produce and reproduce the material requirements of life.{{sfn|Seligman|1901|p=163}} Marx then extended this premise by asserting the importance of the fact that, in order to carry out production and exchange, people have to enter into very definite social relations, most fundamentally "production relations". However, production does not get carried out in the abstract, or by entering into arbitrary or random relations chosen at will. [[Human beings]] collectively work on [[nature]] but do not do the same work; there is a [[division of labour]] in which people not only do different jobs, but according to Marxist theory, some people live off the fruits of others' labour by owning the [[means of production]]. How this is accomplished depends on the type of society. Production is carried out through very definite relations between people. And, in turn, these production relations are determined by the level and character of the [[productive forces]] that are present at any given time in history. For Marx, productive forces refer to the means of production such as the tools, instruments, technology, land, raw materials, and human knowledge and abilities in terms of using these means of production.

Marx identified the production relations of society (arising on the basis of given productive forces) as the [[Base and superstructure|economic base]] of society.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also explained that on the foundation of the economic base there arise certain political institutions, laws, customs, culture, etc., and ideas, ways of thinking, morality, etc. These constituted the political/ideological [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of society. This superstructure not only has its origin in the economic base, but its features also ultimately correspond to the character and development of that economic base, i.e. the way people organize society is determined by the economic base and the relations that arise from its mode of production. [[G.A. Cohen]] argues in ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'' that a society’s legal-political superstructure stabilizes or entrenches its economic structure, but in the other direction the economic relations determine the character of the superstructure, and that the economic base is primary and the superstructure secondary. It is precisely because the superstructure strongly affects the base that the base selects that superstructure. As [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] puts it, "These two directions of influence are so far from being rivals that they are actually complementary. The functional explanation requires that the secondary factor tend to have a causal effect on the primary, for this dispositional fact is the key feature of the explanation."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; It is because the influences in the two directions are not symmetrical that it makes sense to speak of primary and secondary factors, even where one is giving a non-reductionist, "holistic" account of social interaction.

Writers who identify with historical materialism usually postulate that society has moved through a number of types or [[mode of production|modes of production]]. That is, the character of the production relations is determined by the character of the productive forces; these could be the simple tools and instruments of early human existence, or the more developed machinery and technology of present age. The main modes of production Marx identified generally include [[primitive communism]] or [[tribe|tribal society]] (a prehistoric stage), [[ancient world|ancient society]], [[feudalism]], and [[capitalism]]. In each of these social stages, people interact with nature and produce their living in different ways. Any surplus from that production is allotted in different ways. Ancient society was based on a ruling class of slave owners and a class of slaves; feudalism was based on landowners and [[serfs]]; and capitalism based on the capitalist class and the [[working class]]. In the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] the behaviour of actors in the market economy (means of production, distribution and exchange, the relations of production) plays the major role in configuring society. The capitalist class privately owns the means of production, distribution and exchange (e.g., factories, mines, shops and banks) while the working class live by exchanging their socialized [[labour (economics)|labour]] with the capitalist class for wages. 

According to Marxist theorists{{which|date 2017|date=March 2017}}, history develops in accordance with the following observations:{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
#Social progress is driven by progress in the material, [[productive forces]] a society has at its disposal ([[technology]], [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[capital goods]], etc.)
#Humans are inevitably involved in productive relations (roughly speaking, economic relationships or institutions), which constitute our most decisive [[social relations]]. These relations progress with the development of the productive forces. They are largely determined by the [[division of labor]], which in turn tends to determine [[social class]].
#[[Relations of production]] help determine the degree and types of the development of the forces of production, also known as the [[mode of production]]. For example, capitalism tends to increase the rate at which the forces develop and stresses the [[capital accumulation|accumulation of capital]].
#Both productive forces and productive relations progress independently of mankind's strategic intentions or will.
#The [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]]—the cultural and institutional features of a society, its ideological materials—is ultimately an expression of the mode of production (which combines both the forces and relations of production) on which the society is founded.
#Every type of [[State (polity)|state]] is a powerful [[institution]] of the ruling class; the state is an instrument which one class uses to secure its rule and enforce its preferred production relations (and its [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]) onto society.
#State power is usually only transferred from one class to another by social and political upheaval.
#When a given style of production relations no longer supports further progress in the productive forces, either further progress is strangled, or 'revolution' must occur.
#The actual historical process is not predetermined but depends on the class struggle, especially the organization and consciousness of the working class.

==Key implications in the study and understanding of history==
Many writers note that historical materialism represented a revolution in human thought, and a break from previous ways of understanding the underlying basis of change within various human societies. As Marx puts it, "a coherence arises in human history"{{sfn|Marx|Engels|1968|p=660}} because each generation inherits the productive forces developed previously and in turn further develops them before passing them on to the next generation. Further, this coherence increasingly involves more of humanity the more the productive forces develop and expand to bind people together in production and exchange.

This understanding counters the notion that human history is simply a series of accidents, either without any underlying cause or caused by supernatural beings or forces exerting their will on society. Historical materialism posits that history is made as a result of struggle between different social classes rooted in the underlying economic base. According to [[G.A. Cohen]], author of ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'', the level of development of society’s productive forces (i.e., society’s technological powers, including tools, machinery, raw materials, and labour power) determines society’s economic structure, in the sense that it selects a structure of economic relations that tends best to facilitate further technological growth. In historical explanation, the overall primacy of the productive forces can be understood in terms of two key theses:
{{cquote|(a) The productive forces tend to develop throughout history (the Development Thesis).&lt;br /&gt;(b) The nature of the production relations of a society is explained by the level of development of its productive forces (the Primacy Thesis proper).&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
In saying that productive forces have a universal ''tendency'' to develop, Cohen’s reading of Marx is not claiming that productive forces always develop or that they never decline. Their development may be temporarily blocked, but because human beings have a rational interest in developing their capacities to control their interactions with external nature in order to satisfy their wants, the historical tendency is strongly toward further development of these capacities.

Broadly, the importance of the study of history lies in the ability of history to explain the present. [[John Bellamy Foster]] asserts that historical materialism is important in explaining history from a scientific perspective, by following the scientific method, as opposed to belief-system theories like [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]], which do not base their beliefs on verifiable facts and hypotheses.{{sfn|Foster|Clark|2008}}

=== Alienation and freedom ===
[[Hunter-gatherer]] societies were structured so that the economic forces and the political forces were one and the same. The elements of force and relation operated together, harmoniously. In the [[feudal society]], the political forces of the kings and nobility had their relations with the economic forces of the villages through [[serfdom]]. The serfs, although not free, were tied to both forces and, thus, not completely alienated.  Capitalism, Marx argued, completely separates the economic and political forces, leaving them to have relations through a limiting [[government]]. He takes the state to be a sign of this separation—it exists to manage the massive conflicts of interest which arise between classes in all those societies based on property relations.

=== Nations as a product of capitalism ===
According to historical materialism, nations arose at the time of the appearance of capitalism on the basis of community of economic life, territory, language, certain features of psychology, traditions of everyday life and culture. In the [[Manifesto of the Communist Party]] Marx and Engels explained that the coming into existence of nations was the result of class struggle, specifically of the capitalist class's attempts to overthrow the institutions of the former ruling class. Prior to capitalism, nations did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dixon |first=Norm |title=Marx, Engels and Lenin on the National Question |url=http://links.org.au/node/164 |website=Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal |access-date=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marxist theory of the national question was developed further and concretized by Lenin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=В.И. Ленин. О национальном вопросе и национальной политике |url=http://leninism.su/works/115-conspect/4248-v-i-lenin-o-natsionalnom-voprose-i-natsionalnoj-politike.html?showall= |language=ru |access-date=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, there are two opposite tendencies in the development of nations under capitalism. One of them is expressed in the activization of national life and national movements against the oppressors. The other is expressed in the expansion of links among nations, the breaking down of barriers between them, the establishment of a unified economy and of a world market.{{sfn|Lenin|n.d.}}

===Determinist presumption towards a socialist future===
In his analysis of the movement of history, Marx predicted the breakdown of capitalism, and the establishment in time of a communist society in which class-based human conflict would be overcome. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The means of production would be held in the common ownership and used for the common good. In the mention of "human liberation" one should not neglect that, in the level of production, the working class is the most oppressed.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} But either way, in the prediction of the future, one shall first know of the past (e.g.,  the establishment of capitalism, and the transitional part of feudalism).

==Warnings against misuse==
{{See also|Economic determinism}}Marx himself took care to indicate that he was only proposing a guideline to historical research (''Leitfaden'' or ''Auffassung''), and was not providing any substantive "theory of history" or "grand philosophy of history", let alone a "master-key to history". Engels expressed irritation with dilettante academics who sought to knock up their skimpy historical knowledge as quickly as possible into some grand theoretical system that would explain "everything" about history. He opined that historical materialism and the theory of modes of production was being used as an excuse for not studying history.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, cited approvingly by [[E. P. Thompson]] in '[https://www.marxists.org/archive/thompson-ep/1965/english.htm The peculiarities of the English],' ''Socialist Register'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1872 Preface to the French edition of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' Vol. 1, Marx also emphasized that "There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits". Reaching a scientific understanding was hard work. Conscientious, painstaking research was required, instead of philosophical speculation and unwarranted, sweeping generalizations.

But having abandoned abstract philosophical speculation in his youth, Marx himself showed great reluctance during the rest of his life about offering any generalities or universal truths about human existence or human history. The first explicit and systematic summary of the materialist interpretation of history published, ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'', was written by Friedrich Engels.

One of the aims of Engels's polemic ''Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science'' (written with Marx's approval) was to ridicule the easy "world schematism" of philosophers, who invented the latest wisdom from behind their writing desks. Towards the end of his life, in 1877, Marx wrote a letter to the editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapisky'', which significantly contained the following disclaimer:

{{Quotation|... If Russia is tending to become a capitalist nation after the example of the Western European countries, and during the last years she has been taking a lot of trouble in this direction—she will not succeed without having first transformed a good part of her peasants into proletarians; and after that, once taken to the bosom of the capitalist regime, she will experience its pitiless laws like other profane peoples. That is all. But that is not enough for my critic. He feels himself obliged to metamorphose my historical sketch of the genesis of capitalism in Western Europe into an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself, in order that it may ultimately arrive at the form of economy which will ensure, together with the greatest expansion of the productive powers of social labor, the most complete development of man. But I beg his pardon. (He is both honouring and shaming me too much.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/11/russia.htm |title=Letter from Marx to Editor of the Otecestvenniye Zapisky |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx goes on to illustrate how the same factors can in different historical contexts produce very different results, so that quick and easy generalizations are not really possible. To indicate how seriously Marx took research, when he died, his estate contained several cubic metres of Russian statistical publications (it was, as the old Marx observed, in Russia that his ideas gained most influence).

But what is true is that insofar as Marx and Engels regarded historical processes as [[law]]-governed processes, the possible future directions of historical development were to a great extent ''limited'' and ''conditioned'' by what happened before. Retrospectively, historical processes could be understood to have happened by ''necessity'' in certain ways and not others, and to some extent at least, the most likely variants of the future could be specified on the basis of careful study of the known facts.

Towards the end of his life, Engels commented several times about the abuse of historical materialism.

In a letter to Conrad Schmidt dated 5 August 1890, he stated:

{{Quotation|And if this man (i.e., Paul Barth) has not yet discovered that while the material mode of existence is the ''primum agens''  this does not preclude the ideological spheres from reacting upon it in their turn, though with a secondary effect, he cannot possibly have understood the subject he is writing about. (...) The materialist conception of history has a lot of [dangerous friends] nowadays, to whom it serves as an excuse for not studying history. Just as Marx used to say, commenting on the French "Marxists" of the late 70s: "All I know is that I am not a Marxist." (...) In general, the word "materialistic" serves many of the younger writers in Germany as a mere phrase with which anything and everything is labeled without further study, that is, they stick on this label and then consider the question disposed of. But our conception of history is above all a guide to study, not a lever for construction after the manner of the Hegelian. All history must be studied afresh, the conditions of existence of the different formations of society must be examined individually before the attempt is made to deduce them from the political, civil law, aesthetic, philosophic, religious, etc., views corresponding to them. Up to now but little has been done here because only a few people have got down to it seriously. In this field we can utilize heaps of help, it is immensely big, anyone who will work seriously can achieve much and distinguish himself. But instead of this too many of the younger Germans simply make use of the phrase historical materialism (and everything can be turned into a phrase) only in order to get their own relatively scanty historical knowledge&amp;nbsp;– for economic history is still in its swaddling clothes!&amp;nbsp;– constructed into a neat system as quickly as possible, and they then deem themselves something very tremendous. And after that a Barth can come along and attack the thing itself, which in his circle has indeed been degraded to a mere phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1890/letters/90_08_05.htm |title=Letters: Marx–Engels Correspondence 1890 |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, in a letter to Franz Mehring dated 14 July 1893, Engels stated:

{{Quotation|... there is only one other point lacking, which, however, Marx and I always failed to stress enough in our writings and in regard to which we are all equally guilty. That is to say, we all laid, and were bound to lay, the main emphasis, in the first place, on the derivation of political, juridical and other ideological notions, and of actions arising through the medium of these notions, from basic economic facts. But in so doing we neglected the formal side&amp;nbsp;– the ways and means by which these notions, etc., come about&amp;nbsp;– for the sake of the content. This has given our adversaries a welcome opportunity for misunderstandings, of which Paul Barth is a striking example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm |title=Letters: Marx–Engels Correspondence 1893 |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms ==
Philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''Conjectures and Refutations'', critiqued such claims of the explanatory power or valid application of historical materialism by arguing that it could explain or explain away any fact brought before it, making it [[falsifiability#Historicism|unfalsifiable]] and thus [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. Similar arguments were brought by [[Leszek Kołakowski]] in ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]].''{{sfnm |1a1=Kołakowski |1y=1978 |2a1=Popper |2y=1957}}

In his 1940 essay ''[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]'', scholar [[Walter Benjamin]] compares historical materialism to [[the Turk]], an 18th-century device which was promoted as a mechanized automaton which could defeat skilled chess players but actually concealed a human who controlled the machine. Benjamin suggested that, despite Marx's claims to scientific objectivity, historical materialism was actually quasi-religious. Like the Turk, wrote Benjamin, "[t]he puppet called 'historical materialism' is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of [[theology]], which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight." Benjamin's friend and colleague [[Gershom Scholem]] would argue that Benjamin's critique of historical materialism was so definitive that, as [[Mark Lilla]] would write, "nothing remains of historical materialism&amp;nbsp;... but the term itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lilla |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Lilla |date=25 May 1995 |title=The Riddle of Walter Benjamin |magazine=The New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benjamin was arguing against a mechanistic form of historical materialist explanation then prevalent in Stalin's Russia, and was himself a committed, if unorthodox, Marxist. Later in "On the Concept of History", he writes:

{{quote|Class struggle, which for a historian schooled in Marx is always in evidence, is a fight for the crude and material things without which no refined and spiritual things could exist.&amp;nbsp;... There is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism. And just as such a document is never free of barbarism, so barbarism taints the manner in which it was transmitted from one hand to another. The historical materialist therefore dissociates himself from this process of transmission as far as possible. He regards it as his task to brush history against the grain.{{sfn|Benjamin}}}}

Underlying the dispute among historians are the different assumptions made about the definition or concept of "[[history]]" and "[[historiography]]". Different historians take a different view of what it is all about, and what the possibilities of historical and social scientific knowledge are.

{{Main article|Modernization theory}}
This article delineates the '''history of modernisation theory'''. Modernisation refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or '[[Traditional society|traditional]]' to a 'modern' [[society]]. The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that, with assistance, "traditional" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have. Modernisation theory attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to [[social progress]] and development of societies, and seeks to explain the process of [[social evolution]]. Modernisation theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, [[World-systems theory|world-systems]] theorists, [[globalisation]] theorists and [[dependency theory|dependency]] theorists among others. Modernisation theory not only stresses the process of change, but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Earliest expressions of the theory ==
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Émile Durkheim]]

The basic principles of Modernisation theory can be derived from the [[Idea of Progress]], which emerged in the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] with the idea that people themselves could develop and change their society. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The French philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]] was involved in the origins of the theory with the idea that technological advancements and economic changes can enable changes in moral and cultural values. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Condorcet was the first to make the connection between economic and social development and to suggest that there can be continuous progress and improvement in human affairs.&lt;ref name="Gilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilman|first1=Nils|title=Modernization theory : its origins and rise in Cold War America|date=2003|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7399-7|edition=Johns Hopkins pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of this view implies that new processes and improvements are continually needed to keep pace with a constantly changing world. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Furthermore, Condorcet advocated technological advancement as a means of giving people further control over their environments, arguing that technological progress would eventually spur social progress. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In addition to [[social structure]] and the evolution of societies, the French [[sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] developed the concept of [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], which stresses the interdependence of the institutions of a society and their interaction in maintaining cultural and social unity. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His most famous work is ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', which described mechanisms for the maintenance of [[social order]] and the ways in which primitive societies might make the transition to becoming more economically advanced industrial societies. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Durkheim suggested that in a capitalist society, with a complex division of labour, economic regulation would be needed to maintain order. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} He stressed that the major transition from a primitive social order to a more advanced industrial society could otherwise bring crisis and disorder. Durkheim furthermore developed the idea of [[social evolution]], which was coined by [[Herbert Spencer]], which indicates how societies and cultures develop over time; for Durkheim, social evolution is like biological evolution with reference to the development of its components. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As with living organisms and species, societies progress through several stages, generally beginning at a simple level and developing toward a more complex level of organisation. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Societies adapt to surrounding environments, but also interact with other societies, which further contributes to progress and development. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
Modern sociology evolved in part as a reaction to the problems associated with [[modernity]], such as [[industrialisation]] and the process of [[rationalization (sociology)|'rationalisation']]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Modernisation theory emerged further in the late 19th century and was especially popular among scholars in the mid-20th century. One notable advocate was Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] whose ''Mandarins of the Future'' (2003) stressed the importance of societies remaining open to change and saw reactionary forces as restricting development. Maintaining tradition for tradition's sake was thought to be harmful to progress and development.&lt;ref name="khan 162-164"&gt;Khan, p. 162–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of modernisation tend to fall into two camps, optimists and pessimists. The former view holds that what some see as a setback for the theory (events such as the [[Iranian Revolution]] or the persistence of instability in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) are invariably temporary setbacks &lt;ref&gt;Brugger and Hannan, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; on the road to progress. Pessimists argue that certain 'non-modern' areas of the world are incapable of becoming modern.&lt;ref name="Macionis 953"&gt;Macionis, p. 953.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eminent sociologist [[Max Weber]] also made important contributions to development theory. Weber's concept of "rationalisation" was mobilised by those who held that the most important factor behind modernisation was the growth of rationality as a core value. Normally rationality denotes the universally available logic underpinning thought and deliberation in a particular society. Most theorists consider it indispensable for the modernisation process. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Rationality allows people to think in new and innovative ways; innovation is thus coeval with modernisation.

== Contributors ==

Among the academics who contributed much to this theory are [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W. W. Rostow]], who in his ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system]] side of the modernisation, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernisation in his [[Rostovian take-off model]]. [[David Apter]] concentrated on the [[political system]] and [[history of democracy]], researching the connection between [[democracy]], good [[governance]] and efficiency and modernisation. [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] in "Some Social Requisites of Democracy" (1959) argued that economic development sets off a series of profound social changes that together tend to produce democracy. [[David McClelland]] (''The Achieving Society'', 1967) approached this subject from the [[psychology|psychological]] perspective, with his [[motivation]]s theory, arguing that modernisation cannot happen until a given society values innovation, striving for improvement and entrepreneurship. Alex Inkeles (''Becoming Modern'', 1974) similarly creates a model of ''modern personality'', which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open for new experiences, rational and being able to create long-term plans for the future. [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) interprets modernisation from the point of view of societies that are quickly and radically transformed. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Case studies ==

===United States===
[[File:American Progress (John Gast painting).jpg|thumb|300px|This painting (circa 1872) by [[John Gast (painter)|John Gast]] called ''American Progress'', is an allegorical representation of the modernisation of the new west. Here [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]], a personification of the United States, leads civilisation westward with American settlers, stringing telegraph wire as she sweeps west; she holds a school book. The different stages of economic activity of the pioneers are highlighted and, especially, the changing forms of transportation. The Native Americans and wild animals flee.]]
The [[Progressive Era|Progressives in the United States in the early 20th century]] were avid modernisers. They believed in [[science]], technology, expertise—and especially education—as the grand solution to society's weaknesses. Characteristics of progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban-industrial society, belief in mankind's ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, and a belief in the ability of experts and in efficiency of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Buenker, and KABASO.S.MUYA. ''Progressivism'' (1986); Maureen Flanagan, ''America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s-1920s'' (2007); Modernisation theory exerts a "powerful influence" on historians dealing with the 1896-1916 era, asserts Martin J. Sklar, ''The United States as a developing country'' (1992) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Monroe, a professor of history at Columbia University, was a member of [[The Inquiry]]—a team of American experts at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He drew on his experience in the Philippines to assess the educational needs of developing areas such as Albania, Turkey and central Africa. Presenting educational development as instrumental to nation-building and socioeconomic development, Monroe recommended the implementation of a progressive curriculum - with an emphasis on practical, adult, and teacher training - in a national system of education, as a basis for self-development, except in Africa. His approach shaped American cooperation with developing countries in the 1920s and modernisation efforts during the 1920s-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Ment, "Education, nation‐building and modernisation after World War I: American ideas for the Peace Conference," ''Paedagogica Historica,'' Feb 2005, Vol. 41 Issue 1/2, pp 159-177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany's "Sonderweg"===
{{main article|Sonderweg}}
[[Jürgen Kocka|Kocka]] (1988) and Sheri Berman are historians who emphasise the central importance of a German ''[[Sonderweg]]'' ("special path") or "exceptionalism" as the root of [[Nazism]] and the German catastrophe in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Berman, "Modernisation in Historical Perspective: The Case of Imperial Germany," ''World Politics,'' Volume 53, Number 3, April 2001, pp. 431-462 {{doi|10.1353/wp.2001.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fritz Fischer]] and his students emphasised [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Germany’s primary guilt for causing World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, "German History before Hitler: The Debate about the German 'Sonderweg.'" ''Journal of Contemporary History,''  Jan 1988, Vol. 23#1, pp 3-16 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/260865 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s-1870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society. Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Wehler, ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914-1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society. None of the series has yet been translated into English. A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871-1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history. Scholars of the 19th century who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the "western path" typified by Great Britain. The stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a [[Welfare state|social welfare state]].  In the 1950s, historians in  West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933-1945. The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism. The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in [[German historiography]]: the [[long 19th century]], the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West.  After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg.  While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Walser Smith,  "When the Sonderweg Debate Left Us ," ''German Studies Review,''on May 2008, Vol. 31#2  pp 225-240&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century France===
In his seminal book ''Peasants Into Frenchmen: The Modernisation of Rural [[France]], 1880–1914'' (1976), historian [[Eugen Weber]] traced the modernisation of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Amato, "Eugen Weber's France" ''Journal of Social History,'' Volume 25, 1992 pp 879–882.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasised the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, "The Second Republic, Politics, and the Peasant," ''French Historical Studies'' Vol. 11, No. 4 (Autumn, 1980), pp. 521-550 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/286349 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was widely praised, but was criticised by some&lt;ref&gt;Ted W. Margadant, "French Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: A Review Essay," ''Agricultural History,'' Summer 1979, Vol. 53 Issue 3, pp 644-651&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870.

====Greece====
The modernising force of the post-civil war Greek society came primarily as a result of the European and US geopolitical strategy for the region of eastern Mediterranean. Greece ought to be a modern capitalistic state to counter the proximity of several eastern and third world bloc countries and the strong [[Communist Party of Greece|national communist movement]]. According to [[Truman doctrine]] and with the support of local elites, a great economical  leap forward took place along with the severe repression that led to the 1967 coup d'état.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore A. Couloumbis, Greece in the Twentieth Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kostis Moskof, Isagogika shri istovia ton kinimatos tis evgatis taxis&lt;/ref&gt;
This dramatic change covered the long-standing cultural divide of greek academia, comparing modern and [[neo-greek]] to ancient and traditional identities. Music, art and [[cinema of greece|cinema]], influenced by the pioneers of American and European tendencies thrived,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Papadimitriou and Yannis Tzioumakis, Greek Cinema&lt;/ref&gt; until the milestone of 1967, in contrast to the [[authoritarian]] and  [[tradition]]alist military and paramilitary structures. This dimension is vital as it reveals the process of modernisation under the western directives in all social levels that came in fact in opposition to the political directives of the same source.&lt;ref&gt;A. Papachelas, The rape of greek democracy: The American Factor, 1947-1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
Many studies of modernisation have focused on the [[history of Japan]] in the [[Meiji period|late 19th]] century,&lt;ref&gt;Shuzo Teruoka, ed. ''Agriculture in the Modernization of Japan, 1850-2000'' (2008); Cyril Black, ''The Modernization of Japan and Russia'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China]] and [[India]] in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell H. Jeffries, ''China's Agricultural Modernization'' (2009); June Grasso, Jay Cornin, and Michael Kort, ''Modernization and Revolution in China: From the Opium Wars to the Olympics'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the process of borrowing science and technology from the West has been explored.

====China====
Modernisation theory failed to explain the experience of China. Mao modernised the People's Republic of China with massive industrialisation projects and social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eberstadt|first=Nick|title=Did Mao Fail?|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|year=1980|volume=4|series=4|pages=120–133|jstor=40256004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, China did not become a democratic country after its modernisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=Shaohua|title=Balancing Development and Democracy: DENG'S ROLE IN THE CHINESE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS|journal=World Affairs|year=1998|volume=161|series=2|pages=69–81|jstor=20672544}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Nowadays, even though the Soviet-style authoritarian regimes have already collapsed worldwide, China did not have any major political reforms after Mao's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garver|first=John W.|title=The Chinese Communist Party and the Collapse of Soviet Communism|journal=The China Quarterly|year=1993|pages=1–26|jstor=654237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country remained authoritarian, despite the size of its economic sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Baogang|author2=Mark E.

China has been attempting to modernise ever since the [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution of 1911]] and the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last dynasty of China. Before the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, it attempted to reform from 1902 to 1908 to save itself and instigated reforms in infrastructure, transportation, and government. These reforms were based on Western models and even included aspects of democracy, which are often associated with the process of modernisation. However, these reforms were largely unsuccessful and resulted in the Revolution of 1911. Following the Revolution of 1911, other movements such as the [[May 4th Movement]] of 1919 advocated for modernisation, [[iconoclasm]], and a rejection of foreign influence and [[imperialism]]. From the beginning of the 20th century until the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, China has been delayed in efforts to modernise due to an era of warlordism, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and civil war between the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] and [[KMT]].&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern China|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|edition=Third|editor=R. Keith Schoppa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardels|first=Nathan|title=The West No Longer Owns Modernity|journal=New Perspect|year=2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=61–64|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5842.2011.01271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the communist party came to power in 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] used the Soviet Union as China’s example for modernisation. [[The Great Leap Forward]] from 1958-1961 was Mao’s version of the Soviet Union’s [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five year Plan]], and its goals were to create a modern communist society through industrialisation and collectivisation. Mao Zedong aimed to become a world power without foreign, mainly western, involvement, ideas, or capitalism and preached the idea of self-reliance. Mao did contribute to the modernisation of China, however The Great Leap Forward is regarded as a failure and the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976 was detrimental to China's industrialisation progress.&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt; [[File:Shanghai-pudong panorama.jpg|thumb|The Modern Chinese City of [[Shanghai]]]] However, during Mao's era, he transformed China from a predominantly agrarian country to an industrialised power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=476–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, China was able to produce most of commodities and goods by its own industry. Mao laid the foundation for China's economic development in Deng's era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsui |first1=Anne S. |last2=Schoonhoven |first2=Claudia Bird |last3=Meyer |first3=Marshall W. |last4=Lau |first4=Chung-Ming |last5=Milkovich |first5=George T. |title=Organization and Management in the Midst of Societal Transformation: The People's Republic of China |journal=Organization Science |year=2004 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=133–144 |jstor=30034719 |doi=10.1287/orsc.1040.0063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic reforms of Chinese Supreme Leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] are attributed to China’s economic success in the 21st century. Deng focused on four modernisations: agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. The West was used as an example for several of these modernisations, however their management was completely Chinese. Deng began de-collectivisation and allowed [[Township and Village Enterprise]]s (TVE), [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZ), foreign investment, profit incentive, and even privatisation.

While Mao advocated self-reliance, Deng generated foreign exchange to finance modernisation. His famous quote is, "It doesn’t matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice." Post Deng Reforms continued on this path, which is acknowledged as a shift from the [[iron rice bowl]] to the porcelain rice bowl, or government owned to privatised. Although China’s economy has shifted towards privatisation and capitalism, the PRC remains an authoritative regime, which is contradictory in comparison to other examples of countries that have modernised. Democracy is the political characteristic that has defined modernised nations in the past and the modernisation theory suggests democracy follows with the development of a modernised state.&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"/&gt; China was late in modernisation and has thus had many other countries as examples to base its model of modernisation off of.&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;

The [[One-Child Policy]] has also been a technique to contribute or even force the modernisation of China. Instigated in 1978, the one-child policy has created a generation known as "singletons" or "little emperors" (''xiao huangdi'').&lt;ref name="Little Emperors"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feeding China's Little Emperors:Food Children and Social Change|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|editor=Jun Jing}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Chinese state enforced a rapid fertility transition designed to cultivate a generation of "high-quality" people with resources and ambition to join the global elite."&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fong|first=Vanessa|title=Only Hope: Coming of Age under China's One-Child Policy|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|page=17|isbn=978-0804753302}}&lt;/ref&gt; These little emperors are expected to compete with the first-world countries having no siblings to compete with for parental investment. Normally with modernisation and urbanisation smaller or [[nuclear family|nuclear families]] evolve as the result. China has switched this logic, hoping that creating the culture of the nuclear family with the one-child policy it will produce modernisation.&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"/&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, China is still in the process of modernisation. In 2010 it had the third greatest GDP and GDP (PPP) in the world with the world’s largest labour force, and is acknowledged as the world’s second largest economy.&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|work=East and Southeast Asia: China|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 its economy was still increasing in growth at 10.3%.&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book"/&gt; China has also successfully joined the largely Western international arena with its membership of the [[United Nations|UN]] in 1971, the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] in 2001, and hosted the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in 2008. China’s goal is to continue modernising until it joins the first-world and becomes the core instead of the semi-periphery or periphery, from the [[core-periphery| core-periphery model]].&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"/&gt;

The modernisation of China through urbanisation, industrialisation, and economic policy has benefited the country economically as it rises as a world power in the 21st century. However it now is experiencing the problems associated the other modern countries and capitalism. These problems include the growing disparity between the rich and poor, urban vs. rural and migration, and ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowntree|first=Lester|title=Diversity Amid Globalization: World Regions, Environment, Development|year=2008|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-600554-4|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
Modernisers in [[South Korea]] in the late 19th century were torn between the American and the Japanese models. Most of the Koreans involved were educated Christians who saw America as their ideal model of civilisation. However, most used Japan as a practical model - as an example of how a fellow East Asian country, which 30 years before was also backward, could succeed in modernising itself. At the same time, reformists' nationalist reaction against the domineering, colonial behaviour of the Japanese in Korea often took the form of an appeal to international (Western) standards of civilisation. The Western-oriented worldview of the early Christian nationalist reformers was complex, multilayered, and often self-contradictory - with 'oppressive' features not easily distinguishable from 'liberational' ones. Their idealised image of the West as the only true, ideal civilisation relegated much of Korea's traditional culture to a position of 'oriental'.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Tikhonov, "The 1890s Korean Reformers' View of Japan - a Menacing Model?" ''International Journal of Asian Studies'' 2005 2(1): 57-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-image of Koreans was formed through complex relationships with modernity, colonialism, Christianity, and nationalism. This formation was initiated by a change in the notion of 'civilisation' due to the transformation of 'international society' and thereafter was affected by the trauma of Japanese colonisation. Through the process of transition from a traditional Confucian notion of civilisation to a Western notion of acceptance and resistance, Koreans shaped their civilisation as well as their notions of the racial, cultural, and individual modern self. Western Orientalism, in particular, accompanied the introduction of the Western notion of civilisation, which served as the background for forming the self-identity of Koreans. The fact that the Japanese version of [[Orientalism]] emerged from the domination of Korea by Japan played a critical role in shaping the self-identity of Koreans. Consequently, Korea still maintains an inferiority complex toward Western culture, ambivalent feelings toward Japanese culture, and biased - positive or negative - views of their own cultural traditions. Thus both modernisation and colonisation have shaped the formation or distortion of self-consciousness of non-Western peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Yong-hwa Chung, "The Modern Transformation of Korean Identity: Enlightenment and Orientalism," ''Korea Journal'' 2006 46(1): 109-138&lt;/ref&gt;

The US launched a decades-long intensive development starting in 1945 to modernise South Korea, with the goal of helping it become a model nation-state and an economic success. Agents of modernisation at work in Korea included the US Army, the Economic Cooperation Administration, the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency, and a number of nongovernmental organisations, among them the Presbyterian Church, the [[YMCA]], Boy Scouts and the [[Ford Foundation]].   Many Koreans migrated to California and Hawaii, and brought back firsthand accounts of modern business and governmental practices that they sought to adapt to Korean conditions.&lt;ref&gt;David Ekbladh, "How to Build a Nation," ''Wilson Quarterly'' 2004 28(1): 12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
Modernisation theory was not compatible with Japan's experience. After industrialisation and economic modernisation, a democratic society did not appear in Japan. Japan instead became an aggressive authoritarian fascist state, up until the Allied Forces defeated Japan in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Public Life in Authoritarian Japan|journal=Daedalus|year=1998|volume=127|series=3|pages=133–165|jstor=20027510}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were almost no democratic principles or practices in pre-war Japanese politics. Prior to the liberation of Japan by the United States from its military government, Japanese culture always honoured obedience and hierarchy, and Japanese people also despised individualism and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Thomas U.|title=From Sword to Chrysanthemum: Japan's Culture of Anti-militarism|journal=International Security|year=1993|volume=17|issue=4|series=4|pages=119–150|jstor=2539024|doi=10.2307/2539024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had already modernised and became an industrialised country during its Meiji period, which happened long before Japan's defeat in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=La Follette|first=Philip F. |author2=Edward M. Coffman |author3=Paul H. Hass|title=With MacArthur in the Pacific: A Memoir by Philip F. La Follette|journal=The Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=1980–1981|volume=64|series=2|pages=82–106|jstor=4635497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was probably the first country in East Asia that industrialised successfully. It quickly became one of the imperialist and colonial powers. Japan defeated the Qing dynasty of China in 1894, and subsequently defeated Russia in 1905. Korea and Taiwan were annexed by the Japanese Empire later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuels|first=Richard J.|title=Reinventing Security: Japan since Meiji|journal=Daedalus|year=1991|volume=120|series=4|pages=47–68|jstor=20025403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Japan invaded China in 1931, it had already finished its industrialising process and had enough industrial power to wage a war itself. Japan's navy was among one of the world's most advanced navies, with almost no challenger in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamamura|first=Kozo|title=Success Illgotten? The Role of Meiji Militarism in Japan's Technological Progress|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=1977|volume=37|series=1|pages=113–135|jstor=2119450|doi=10.1017/s0022050700096777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of Japan after the Second War was simply a result of the military supremacy of the United States. The United States absolutely ruled over Japan after its defeat, with General MacArthur as the de facto emperor of Japan at the time. Japan had no choice but listen to the orders of General MacArthur and his colleagues. In order to be compatible with the foreign policy and national interest of the United States, SCAP and General MacArthur forced Japan to demilitarise and democratise after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitahara|first=Michio|title=Douglas MacArthur as a Father Figure in Occupied Japan After World War II|journal=International Social Science  Review|year=1989|volume=64|series=1|pages=20–28|jstor=41881853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan quickly went through a lot of changes concerning modernisation after their defeat. This happened starting with United States quickly intervening with Japan internally. American demilitarisation and democratisation was accepted by the people of Japan without strong resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=461–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the occupation of United States, SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) was established, which was an institution in charge of formulating policies. The goal of SCAP was to dissolve the army and navy, and also to punish responsible leaders, and it established the New constitution of 1946.&lt;ref name="Modern Japan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Modern Japan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCAP could not function without the assistance of Japanese government because the language barrier was too high. However, this actually helped make bigger changes in creating demilitarisation and democratisation.  SCAP helped people to gain freedoms of speech, press and the right to organise labour or farmer unions.

As such, the new constitution created by SCAP granted civil and political rights to the people; consequently, leading to modernisation. It also allowed freedom of speech and association, right to organise labour association and movements, or create unions, and implemented grounds for incredible civil right for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=460–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also held an important role in modernising Japan. Japan concentrated on their industry and technology to achieve growth. For that, the state gave assistances to several industries and adopted protectionism policies. Government stepped in as lender, as facilitator of access to foreign exchange, raw materials, or technology licenses, and as rescuer when problems arise.&lt;ref name="Modern Japan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Modern Japan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate, the most important guiding agency was the [[MITI]] (Ministry of International Trade and Industry). In addition, through the 1960s, Japanese government used economic policies such as tariffs to obstruct imports and protect Japanese firms from foreign competitors in domestic market to become a modernised country.

====Turkey====
[[Turkey]], under [[Kemal Atatürk]] in the 1920s and 1930s, engaged in a systematic modernisation programme [[Atatürk's Reforms|called "Kemalism"]]. Hundreds of European scholars came to help. Together with Turkish intellectuals they developed a successful model of development.&lt;ref&gt;Craig C. Hansen, "Are We Doing Theory Ethnocentrically? A Comparison of Modernization Theory and Kemalism," ''Journal of Developing Societies'' (0169796X), 1989, Vol. 5 Issue 2, pp 175-187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murat Ergin, "Cultural encounters in the social sciences and humanities: western émigré scholars in Turkey," ''History of the Human Sciences,'' Feb 2009, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 105-130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Reisman, ''Turkey's Modernization: Refugees from Nazism and Atatürk's Vision'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ward and Dankwart Rustow, eds. ''Political Modernization in Japan and Turkey'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
Since independence, modernisation has been a driving force for [[Chile]]'s political elites. Ree (2007) analyses projects of modernisation that have been implemented from above since 1964. Despite their ideological differences and very different understandings of what modernity is, these projects shared key characteristics in their construction and implementation, such as the use of developmental theories, their state-orientation, the prominent role of technocrats and state-planning, and the capacity of adaptation in sight of civil unrest. These projects have produced patterns of modernity that have proven particularly stable.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Van Der Ree, "Modernisation in Chile: from the 'Revolution in Liberty' to 'Growth with Equity'," ''Bicentenario: Revista De Historia De Chile Y America'' 2007 6(2): 39-69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Modernisation has been attributed with creating positive development around the world, but in Modern times its ability to promote development, specifically in [[Africa]], has been less than so.  Modernisation that has taken place in Africa can be described as something that has yet to benefit most of the African countries.

Modernisation through development has led to problems in [[Nigeria]] by bringing in private, foreign owned oil companies that have been exploiting the natural resource wealth of the country.  Because the oil companies are generally owned by a different nation, the profits are mostly being exported from Nigeria with only one fifteenth of the wealth produced in the region returning to it.  Shell, the oil company operating in Ogoniland, Nigeria has helped the country develop and industrialise on a small scale, but it has primarily challenged the sovereignty and autonomy of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogowski|first=edited by Patrick O'Neil, Ronald|title=Essential readings in comparative politics|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-93401-4|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of scholars view modernisation as a sort of westernisation where western institutions such as national parks and industries are brought into existing cultures where their use does not make as much sense.  Along with modernisation comes a loss of culture and society, and the individual is strengthened. An African tribe known as the Ik was forced to change their habits due to modernisation and the creation of individual countries caused by colonialism. Nationalisation, as a tool of modernisation, was imparted on Africa by colonialists who wanted to westernise and modernise tribal Africa.  The creation of individual countries made life for the tribal Ik more difficult because they were forced out of their nomadic lifestyle into a settlement based around a newly founded national park that practically destroyed their livelihood by restricting their hunting grounds to specific non-park areas.  The creation of national parks have increased cultivation, which can be seen as good development because people no longer depend solely  on livestock.  This creation of a new sort of livelihood has mixed improvements, because the tribal setting is not removed, but is put into a single place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turbull|first=Colin M.|title=The Mountain People|year=1972|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
There are several disputes over the origin of the Lurs and they are believed to be from the Elamite and Kassite origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Medean or Persian tribe of Aryan origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/iran/lurs-iran |title=The Lurs of Iran |publisher=Cultural Survival |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nowadays they speak an Iranian language and consider themselves as pure Iranians.
=== Name ===
The word Lur for the first time is seen in the writings of some historians and geographers of the 10th century and later in the form of اللور, اللر and لور (Lur). [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] in [[Tarikh-i guzida|Tarikh-e gozida]] (1330 AD) referred to the settlement of Lurish tribes in Levant and then their mass migration towards the current Lurish-inhabited areas. Several hyphothesis are discussed about the origin of the name Lur or Lor. It is attributed to a person called Lur or Lohraseb and some believe that the name refers to the area of first settlement of this ethnic group. The word Ler or Lir (literally Forst or forest mountain) is a probable source for this word.&lt;ref&gt;H.Mostawfi. 2000. Tarikhe Gozide (in Persian). Amir Kabir Publications, Tehran&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early History ==
Luristan is mainly a mountainous juicy and lush area with prosperous  pasturages.  There are several dominant tree species like oak, elm, walnut and almond around Luristan.[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Cave painting]] in Doushe cave, Lorestan, Iran, 8th millennium BC]]

The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the [[Ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The [[Kassites]], an ancient people who spoke neither an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] nor a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]], originated in Lorestān. They would control [[Babylonia]] after the fall of the [[Old Babylonian Empire]] ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC.
Luristan was invaded and settled by the Iranian [[Medes]] in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes absorbed the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the [[Kassites]] as well as the [[Gutians]], by the time the area was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the 1st millennium BC.
In February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the [[Achaemenid]] era were made in Lorestan for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82418319/ | title=Archeologist: First signs of Achaemenids discovered in Western Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Aryan settlement in Luristan, precedes more than 1000 years BC. From the Indo-European ethnic groups, first, the Medes settled in areas known as Lorestan. Between 625 and 700 BC, other tribes like the Scythians settled in Lorestan.
=== Elam ===
The first people who ruled areas of Lorestan were Elamites. The extent of the influence of the Elamites has been to the present Mamassani area. They were indigenous peoples of Iran, but there is no proper knowledge of how communities are formed and the beginning of their history. However, They were able to establish a state before the arrival of Aryan ethnic groups in parts of western Iran.&lt;ref name=loor1&gt;{{یادکرد وب| نشانی = http://loor.ir/News.asp?nid=2970&amp;ln=fa| عنوان = آیا لر آریاییست یا عیلامی و کاسی؟| تاریخ بازدید =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴| نویسنده =| تاریخ =۲۶ شهریور ۱۳۸۹| ناشر =نشریه اینترنتی مردم لر| زبان =فارسی| نشانی بایگانی = https://archive.today/Waga| تاریخ بایگانی =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elam government included Khuzestan, modern Lorestan, Poshtkuh (Ilam provice and some western Iraqi areas), Bakhtiari mountains and Southern Lurish settelment. Babylonians called the land of Elamites Elam or Elamto, meaning "the mountain" and perhaps "the land of sunrise".
Elamite is generally accepted to be a [[language isolate]] and thus unrelated to the much later arriving Persian and Iranic languages. In accordance to geographical and archaeological matching, historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto-[[Lurs]], whose language became [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] only in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite#v=onepage&amp;q=proto-lurs%20elamite&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grugni&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grugni | first1 = V | last2 = Battaglia | first2 = V | last3 = Hooshiar Kashani | first3 = B | last4 = Parolo | first4 = S | last5 = Al-Zahery | first5 = N ''et al.

==== Elamite cities ====
The major cities of the Elamites were Shush, Ahvaz, Madakto and Kheidalou. [[Walther Hinz]] believes that the current KhorramAbad in the era of the Elamites was the capital of a dynasty called Simashki.
In the course of several thousand years, the Elamites maintained their identity against strong tribes such as [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadians]], [[Babylonians]], and [[Assyrians]].
Eventually, they were defeated by their enemy of Assyria in 654 BC because of internal disputes and wars.
The rise of the Elamites and the formation of the Elamite government in the north of Khuzestan plain is the most important political event of Iran in the third millennium BC. Since then, before the arrival of the Medes and Persians, what we know from the history of the land of Iran is only the political history of Elamite.

=== Kassites ===
Kassites entered to the Iranian plateau from the highlands of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan before the Aryan migration and then settled  the southwest of Iran. Kassites along with Elam, dominated parts of Lorestan and had an extraordinary skill in making bronze artifacts. They were considered as the most important Zagros mountain tribes and were engaged to livestock breeding. They spoke in a language that was affiliated with Elamite.
They were brave and warrior riders and repeatedly entered into battle with their neighbors, including Elamites and Babylonians. They even managed to overthrow the government of Babylon and ruled theBabylon for six centuries. The rule of the Kassites in Babylonia ended as a result of their defeat from the Elamites. After the defeat from the Elamites, they returned to their mountainous land of Lorestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://pardis.150m.com/kassi572.pdf |عنوان =قوم کاسی | ناشر =مهدی رازانی |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۳ آذر ۱۳۹۱}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =گرانتوسگی |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از زمان باستان تا امروز| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۴۵}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =پیگولووسکایا |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از عهد باستان تا قرن ۱۸| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۵۳}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achaemenids to Sassanids ===
During the rule of Achaemenid, Lorestan was part of the rule of the Kassites and when the Achaemenids moved from Babylon to Hamadan, they had to cross the Lorestan area and pay ransom to the Kassites.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=4454 |عنوان =جبال (۱) (جمع جَبَل) یا کورة جَبَل یا قُهِستان یا قوهستان (معرّب کوهستان) یا بلاد جبال | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahle was the name of a vast land in west of Iran which was included many cities and areas in the current Zagros. The province of Pahla was named after the Sasanian times and the word Pahlavi refers to the people, the language, and the alphabet related to the this region. At the time of the Achaemenids, the current Lorestan, along with Ilam and Khuzestan, were the third state of this great empire. During the Parthian period, this land was one of the Satraps (states) of this dynasty anf finally, during the Sassanid period, the area was named "Pahla".&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2899 |عنوان =پَهلَوی | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Islamic era ==
In spite of several resistance efforts, the Arab conquest of Iran, led to the end of the Sasanid Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran. Iran (including Lurish territory) was under the absolute sovereignty of Arabs for two centuries. Lur people, however, managed to maintain the language and many of their customs. Until the end of the third century AH, the district of Lorestan paid the taxes to Kufa and was directly governed by the Caliphs. Different free-seeking revolts led to gradual reestablishment of Iranian local dynasties in the beginning of the ninth century.
After the Arab dominance, Luristan was under control of [[Hasanwayhids]], [[Buyids]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqids]], respectively.

By the middle of the tenth century, the total Lurish-inhabited areas were known as Luristan. Along with the gradual weakening of Seljuks, several autonomous atabeg were formed across Iran. Luristan Atabegs or Hazaraspids established an autonomous state in the Lurish-inhabited areas. After that, the territory was divided into two parts: Lur-e-kuchek (Minor Luristan) and Lur-e-bozorg (Major Luristan). The former corresponded to modern Luristan and Ilam provinces and some areas in the current western Iraq while the latter included modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluye-Boir Ahmed, Mamasani and some coastal areas in Bushehr. In spite of all these invasions, the Lurs maintained their territorial integrity, absorbed the invaders, and eventually established two local dynasties known as Atabak or Atabeg during the twelfth century.
Hazaraspids (Atabaks of Luristan) is the name of Lur dynasty that ruled a large area of Iran for a long while (1148–1424). Their territory included almost all the current Lurish-inhabited regions. Luristan Atabeg then divided in two Atabegs; the Minor Luristan (Lore kučak) and the Major Luristan (Lore bozorg) with Khorram Abad and Idaj as their capitals, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazaraspids |عنوان =هزاراسپیان | ناشر =دانشنامه ایرانیکا |تاریخ  = |تاریخ بازدید =‎۶ آبان ۱۳۸۹|زبان=انگلیسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lor-e-Bozorg (Major Luristan) ===
A big  part of the Lurish areas came under the control of a local dynasty known as Lur-e bozorg Atabegs during the twelfth century. It was established in 1155 AD. The area under the control of major Luristan rulers (modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmed, Mamasani and parts of Khuzistan, Bushehr and Isfahan provinces) was included a vast territory extending from the Dez River in the north Khuzistan to the central areas of [[Fars province|Fars]] in the southern Iran. In spite of evidences indicating the economic and social proserity, the Atabak dynasty finally extinct by [[Ibrahim Sultan ibn Shahrukh]] invasion in 1423. As a result, the territorial unity and the economic prosperity of the Major Luristan was terminated. The territory was divided into tribal sectins without a centralized coherence. During the Safavid period (1501–1750), Major Luristan was divided into three parts: the northern part became known as [[Bkhtiari people|Bakhtiari]], the central part as [[Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad|Kuhgilu]], and the southern part as [[Mamasani County|Mamasani]].

=== Lor-e-Kuchek (Minor Luristan) ===
Traditionally the Minor Luristan corresponded to current provinces of Luristan and Ilam and some Feyli-inhabited areas in Iraq (belt of mountainous region stretching from the plains of the Tigris in the west to the Diz River in the east).Shojaeddin Khorshid establshed the dynasty as the Atabakan-i-Luristan, which lasted from 1184 to 1597. The rulers established their capital in Khorramabad (currently the provincial capital of [[Luristan province]].

==== Lurish Walies dynasty ====
The Atabak dynasty was replaced by the Wali dynasty (1596–1929). The founder of the new dynasty was Husain Khan, whose father had married the aunt of the last Atabak, and on the basis of this kinship tie Husain Khan later received the position of ruler of Lur-j-kuchek. The Walis played a significant role in the political affairs of Iran. They guarded southwestern Iran against the Ottomans, who constantly attacked the western and southwestern borders of the country. Ali Mardan Khan was appointed the commander-in-chief of the entire Iranian armed forces dur downfall of the Safavids, when the country was invaded by the Afghans in the early eighteenth century (De Bode 1845).

The reign of the Walis coincided with several dynasties of Iran including: Safavid (1501–1736), Afshar (1736–1750), Zand (1750–1794), Qajar (1796–1925) and the beginning of the Pahlavi(1924–1929). The last two dynasties, namely the Qajar and Pahlavi, are responsible for the political weakness of the Lurs and the decline of the Wali dynasty. Thus, the Lurs maintained their political integrity under the Safavids and Afshars, while they ruled over Iran during the Zand dynasty. However, when the Qajars came to power, they divided Lur-i-kuchek into two parts, Luristan and Posht-kuh. From this time on, the domain of the Walis was limited to Posht-kuh only, while Luristan came under the direct control of the central government. Thus, a governor-general, usually a member of the royal family, was appointed by the king and sent to Luristan. Yet during the Qajar dynasty, Luristan was continually in a state of anarchy. The Qajars were unable to subdue the tribes of Luristan and hence, except for some short periods, there was no peace in Luristan. As a matter of fact, the Qajar dynasty lost total control over Luristan after the assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1896. In short, the division of Lur-i-kuchek by the Qajar dynasty weakened the political strength of the Walis and reduced the Lurs' political influence. Furthermore, the inability of the Qajars to establish law and order in Luristan contributed to the expansion of pastoral nomadism and the destruction of settled communities. Consequently, Luristan suffered politically as well as economically under Qajar rule.

The Qajar dynasty was overthrown by Reza Khan, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, in 1925. The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) is best characterized as a dictatorial monarchy with absolute rule, that is, the concentration of power in the monarch's hands. The regime built an army whose strength was without precedent in the history of Iran. The army was used against Lurs and other groups who refused to give up their power to the new regime. Through bloody confrontations between the new monarch and the Lurs (as well as other peoples in Iran), the Pahlavi dynasty eventually crushed the powers of the Lurs. Thus, Reza Shah ended the Wali dynasty of Posht-kuh, executed or exiled many of the Lur leaders, forcefully sedentarized the nomadic pastoral tribes and changed the territorial integrity of Lur-i-kuchek.

== Modern history ==
=== The Lurs under the Pahlavi Regime ===

While the Qajar dynasty was responsible for the spread of anarchy among the Lurs, the Pahlavi-dynasty was responsible for their political disorganization, social disruption and the loss of political freedom and semi-independent status. For the first time in their long history, the Lurs were stripped of their traditional rights and political freedom by the Pahlavi dynasty. When Reza Shah took power, he established a centralized government, transferring power from the provincial communities to Tehran. He carried out his plan through the use of military operations against various provincial communities, including the Lurs. A key element to Reza Shah's success was that the Lurs were not unified so he could attack each group separately. Furthermore, Reza Shah used one tribe to fight against another. As the Lurs were defeated, Reza Shah took the following measures to keep them under control: 1) tribal leaders were removed from their positions of authority and were replaced by military officials, 2) many of the leaders, were executed, imprisoned or exiled to other parts of Iran, 3) some tribes were exiled to distant lands, 4) all pastoral nomadic tribes, which formed the majority of the Lur population, were forceably sedentarized without sufficient provisions, 5) all tribesmen were disarmed, 6) the use of the traditional black tent was outlawed, 7) tribesmen were ordered to abandon their traditional costume and were forced to wear Western clothes; however, this rule was not totally carried out, and 8) governmental offices were established in order to carry out the state policies.

The above policies were intended to subjugate the Lurs to the central government. Reza Shah altered the traditional sociopolitical organization of the Lurs without providing opportunities for their participation in local or national government. Undoubtedly the establishment of the central state demanded the integration of various regions and ethnic groups. However, that need not entail political deprivation and the lack of respect for members of the different tribal or ethnic groups. Under the Pahlavi regime, however, the establishment of the modern state came to mean precisely that – the expansion of state domination and disruption of the traditional political organization without the slightest opportunity for peoples to participate in local or national politics.

Reza Shah was deposed by the British and Russians in 1941, and was replaced by his son Mohammed Reza Shah, who ruled from 1941 to 1979. The reign of Mohammed Reza Shah witnessed further centralization of state power and the disintegration of traditional political organization among the Lurs. The enforcement of the land reform program and the nationalization of the forests and pastureland (1962–63 along with various forces of modernization including the expansion of capitalism, urbanism and modern schooling gradually changed many aspects of the Lurs' culture.

Under the Pahlavi regime, the Lurs lost their freedom and their semi-independent status, and the Lurs' territories were divided into several administrative units without any regard for traditional boundaries. For instance, Lur-i-kuchek has been limited to modern Luristan while Posht-kuh, formerly ruled by the Wali dynasty, was incorporated into Ilam province. The most dramatic change caused by the Pahlavi regime was the loss of freedom and the semi-independent status of the Lurs. Prior to the establishment of the Pahlavi Regime, basic decisions were made within the local communities. For instance, the Bakhtiari was ruled by a local dynasty who paid certain tributes to the central government, while internal affairs were taken care of by the members of that dynasty. In Luristan, each tribal group acted as a semi-independent unit. In Posht-kuh, the Walis were supreme, while the tribes of Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed and those of Mamasani also enjoyed the same internal freedom. The Pahlavi regime, however, sent high-ranking officials from Tehran to supervise the Lur territories. Just prior to the recent revolution, all governors-general were directly appointed by the Shah without taking into consideration the existence of the Lurs' communities. Lurs, like other Iranians, were prohibited from organizing political parties, forming associations or expressing themselves through mass media and public gatherings.

Second, Iranian oil is extracted from the mountain slopes of Luristan, Bakhtiari and Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed provinces, but the Lurs were deprived from their share of oil revenue, particularly during the reign of Mohammed Reza Shah. The money derived from oil went to the pockets of the Tehranis, creating regional economic inequalities.

Third, despite the fact that the Pahlavi regime provided elementary and, to some extent, secondary education for the Lurs, it failed to provide them with opportunities for higher education. Until a few years prior to the revolution, not a single institution of higher education was established among the Lurs, nor were they given scholarships or financial support. The Pahlavi regime was thus responsible for depriving the Lurs of access to higher and prestigious positions. High-ranking Lur families were the only exceptions; they could afford to send their children to universities either in Iran or outside the country.

Modern education was used during the Pahlavi rule as a way to undermine local cultural values. School curriculum was prepared in Tehran without taking the cultural diversity among the Iranian peoples into consideration. Not a single course in the entire elementary, high school or university curricula reflected the history, geography or sociocultural values of the Lurs.

In sum, the Lurs lost their sociopolitical integrity under the Pahlavi dynasty. They were integrated into the "modern" state without any opportunity for effective participation in the decision-making process that affected their lives.

=== The Lurs under the Islamic Regime ===

It is too early to evaluate the sociopolitical conditions of the Lurs under the present regime. So far, political parties, associations and local newspapers have not yet emerged. Administrative boundaries of the Lurs' territories remain unchanged from those of the Pahlavi regime. While it is difficult to speculate about the future of the Lurs under the current regime, considering the fact that the present regime is concerned more with an Islamic community rather than with a country of diverse ethnic groups, it seems unlikely that there will be considerable change in the near future.

'''The''' '''Holberg Prize''' is an international prize awarded annually by the [[government of Norway]] to outstanding scholars for work in [[the arts]], [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], law and theology, either within one of these fields or through interdisciplinary work. The prize is named after the Danish-Norwegian writer and academic [[Ludvig Holberg]] (1684 - 1754). The Holberg Prize comes with a monetary award of 6 million Norwegian kroner ([[Norwegian krone|NOK]]) (approximately $750 000 or €660 000), which are intended to be used to further the research of the recipient. The winner of the Holberg Prize is announced in March, and the award ceremony takes place every June in Bergen, Norway.

== History ==

== The Holberg Week ==
During The Holberg Week in June, The Holberg Prize hosts a series of lectures, discussions and other events in honor of the Holberg Laureate and the Nils Klim Laureate. The events feature the laureates, as well as other high-profile international scholars. The program feature, among other things, the Holberg Symposium, the Nils Klim Seminar and the Holberg Lecture. All events during the Holberg week, with the exception of the award ceremony and government banquet, are open to all and have free entrance. Several of the events are also livestreamed, and available to an international audience.

In addition to The Holberg Week, The Holberg Debate is held in December each year. The debate marks Ludvig Holberg's ideas of enlightenment, and seeks to discuss and find answers to key social issues. The Holberg Debate was held for the first time in 2016. Former participants in the Holberg Debate are [[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[Jostein Gripsrud]], [[Jonathan Heawood]], [[John Pilger]] and [[Julian Assange]].

'''John F. Richards''' (November 3, 1938 - August 23, 2007) was a historian of [[South Asia]] and in particular of the [[Mughal Empire]]. He was Professor of History at [[Duke University]], [[North Carolina]], and a recipient in 2007 of the Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies Award. He participated in and encouraged a multi-disciplinary, multi-regional approach to studies.&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt;

== Life ==
John Richards was born on November 3, 1938 in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]]. His parents, Frank F. Richards and Ella Higgins Richards, subsequently had two more children.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web |title=History Professor John Richards Dies at Age 68 |date=August 30, 2007 |publisher=Durham Herald-Sun |via=DukeToday |url=https://today.duke.edu/2007/08/richards.html |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards graduated from the [[University of New Hampshire]] as [[valedictorian]] in 1961 and on the same day he married his high school sweetheart, Ann Berry. The couple moved to California and, in 1968, to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] when he received an appointment at the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; He was awarded a PhD in History by the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1970. His thesis, later published at ''Mughal Administration in Golconda'' (1975), was written under the direction of [[Thomas R. Metcalf]]. This established him as "one of the leading historians of the Mughal Empire in the United States", according to [[David Gilmartin]], and he went on to write a volume of ''[[The New Cambridge History of India]]'' titled ''The Mughal Empire (1993).&lt;ref name="gilmartin"&gt;{{cite web |title=About John F. Richards |first=David |last=Gilmartin |others=Guha, Sumit; Bhagavan, Manu |publisher=Society for Advancing the History of South Asia |url=http://sahsa.uchicago.edu/node/19 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Richards on the Mughal period include ''The Imperial Monetary System of Mughal India'' (1987) and ''Kingship and Authority in South Asia'' (1998). The impact of the Mughal empire on world events caused him to consider the Mughals to be an "early modern" empire, rather than the medieval one that most commentators believed it to be. It was this belief that led him into studies of world trade and state finances, as well as early modern world environmental history. In 2003, he published ''The Unending Frontier: Environmental History of the Early Modern World'' (2003).&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt;

Richards had worked at Duke University since 1977.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; He was heavily involved with administration of the [[Council of American Overseas Research Centers]] and in reforming the troubled [[American Institute of Pakistan Studies]]. He was also in the vanguard of establishing the [[American Institute of Afghanistan Studies]], the first meeting of which took place at Duke University in 2003&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt; and of which he was the founding president.&lt;ref name="aha" /&gt;

Richards died of cancer at home in [[Durham, North Carolina]], on August 23, 2007, days before he was due to retire. He had two children.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

A ''[[festschrift]]'' titled ''Expanding Frontiers in South Asian and World History: Essays in Honour of John F. Richards'' was published in 2013, edited by [[Richard M. Eaton]], [[Munis D. Faruqui]], Gilmartin and [[Sunil Kumar]].

In 2011, the [[American Historical Association]] inaugurated a prize named in his honor. This is awarded for the best book on South Asian history published during each year.&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite web |title=John F. Richards Prize for South Asian History to Be Launched |first=Robert B. |last=Townsend |date=January 2011 |publisher=American Historical Association |url=http://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/january-2011/john-f-richards-prize-for-south-asian-history-to-be-launched |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josephine "Josie" Talamantez''' is a historian from [[San Diego]], [[California]]. She co-founded [[Chicano Park]] in 1970 and helped develop it into a cultural [[National Historic Landmark]] containing the largest collection of artistic murals in the United States. Talamantez was also the Chief of Programs for the [[California Arts Council]], served as the director of the [[Centro Cultural de la Raza]], and was on the board of the [[National Association of Latino Arts and Culture]].  

== Biography ==
Josephine Talamantez was born and raised in the [[Logan Heights, San Diego|Logan Heights]] neighborhood of San Diego.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtCvDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%22Josephine+Talamantez%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8K2NRfEIqL&amp;sig=aaennKW-JeH4xsjs1F9ZgK80QKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9odao_M7aAhVKYKwKHYdNAhA4ChDoAQhNMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Josephine%20Talamantez%22&amp;f=false|title=Flying Under the Radar with the Royal Chicano Air Force: Mapping a Chicano/a Art History|last=Diaz|first=Ella Maria|date=2017-04-11|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=|isbn=9781477312421|location=|pages=83-85|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[San Diego High School]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Sociology]] from [[University of California, Berkeley]]. She received a [[master's degree]] in [[public history]] from [[California State University, Sacramento]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laprensa-sandiego.org/featured/josephine-talamantez-preserving-the-history-of-barrio-logan/|title=Josephine Talamantez: Preserving the History of Barrio Logan |last=|first=|date=|website=La Prensa San Diego|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandmother moved to Logan Heights in the early 20th century, and Talamantez is the third generation to live in that area.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Creation and stewardship of Chicano Park ==
In 1970, the [[California Highway Patrol]] announced they were planning to build a substation below the Coronado bridge, replacing a potential park area that was there. Local residents, including Talamantez, responded by staging a 12-day occupation and successfully demanded that the space be allowed to remain a park. Talamantez, who was 18 years old and a student at [[San Diego City College]] at the time, helped found the Chicano Park Steering Committee to negotiate with officials on behalf of the park.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-chicano-historic-20170111-story.html|title=Chicano Park named National Historic Landmark|last=Warth|first=Gary|date=|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Talamantez and others in the Steering Committee started discussing the addition of Mexican-American artwork to the park. Over the next 20 years, many pieces of artwork were added, including more than 70 murals by Chicano artists from across California, making the park the largest collection of murals in the United States. Other works of art in the park include [[Sculpture|sculptures]], [[Earthworks (art)|earthworks]], and an [[Architecture|architectural]] piece dedicated to the cultural heritage of the community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/san-diego-activists-demand-city-owned-building-for-chicano-park-museum|title=San Diego Activists Demand City-Owned Building for Park Museum|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/chicano-parks-history-could-fill-a-museum/|title=Chicano Park's History Could Fill a Museum – and Activists Think it Should - Voice of San Diego|date=2016-04-18|work=Voice of San Diego|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talamantez is currently working towards opening a Chicano Park Museum and Cultural Center inside a nearby city-owned building that used to house the Cesar Chavez Continuing Education Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sdcitybeat.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood-watch-barrio-logan/|title=Neighborhood Watch: Barrio Logan|last=Bailey|first=Torrey|date=2017-04-05|work=San Diego CityBeat|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/apr/21/barrio-logan-chicano-park-history/|title=Barrio Logan's Chicano Park: The Efforts To Cement Its History|last=Cavanaugh|first=Daniela Contreras, Maureen|work=KPBS Public Media|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Landmark status ===

Talamantez and Manny Galaviz submitted the proposal that successfully added Chicano Park to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2013 due to its association with the [[Chicano Movement]]. 

In 1997, Talamantez began the process of placing Chicano Park with its artwork and murals on the National Register in order to prevent the city from damaging the murals while retrofitting [[San Diego–Coronado Bridge|Coronado Bridge]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Years later, Talamantez traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to make a case before a national review and advisory committee, and Chicano Park was successfully designated as a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in California|National Historic Landmark]] in December 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Chicano-Park-Wins-US-Landmark-Status-as-Trump-Era-Looms-20170116-0014.html|title=Chicano Park Wins US Landmark Status as Trump Era Dawns|last=Gabriel|first=Elliott|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/jan/16/landmark-status-chicano-park-boosters-renew-push-m/|title=With Landmark Status For Chicano Park, Boosters Renew Push For Museum|last=Lipkin|first=Maureen Cavanaugh, Michael|work=KPBS Public Media|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 
'''Limmu''' was an [[Assyria]]n [[eponym]]. At the beginning of the reign of an Assyrian king, the limmu, an appointed royal official, would preside over the New Year festival at the capital. Each year a new limmu would be chosen.  Although picked by lot, there was most likely a limited group, such as the men of the most prominent families or perhaps members of the city assembly.  The Assyrians used the name of the limmu for that year to designate the year on official documents. Lists of limmus have been found accounting for every year between 892 BC and 648 BC.

During the [[Assyria|Old Assyrian]] period, the king himself was never the ''limmum'', as it was called in their language.  In the [[Assyrian Empire|Middle Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian]] periods, however, the king could take this office.

The categorization of the past into discrete, quantified named blocks of time is called [[periodization]].&lt;ref name="Rabinowtz"&gt;Adam Rabinowitz. ''[https://www.academia.edu/6647852/Temporal_Divides_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Major_Schemes_of_Periodization_in_Indian_History It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data]''. Study of the Ancient World Papers, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a list of such '''named time periods''' as defined in various fields of study. Major categorization systems include '''[[Chronology of the universe|cosmological]]''' (time periods in the [[Big bang|origin]] and mass evolution of the universe), '''[[Geological time scale|geological]]''' (time periods in the [[history of Earth|origin and evolution]] of the Earth), '''[[Biological anthropology|anthropological]]''' (time periods in the origin and [[human evolution|evolution]] of humans) and '''[[History|historical]]''' (written history).

These can be divided broadly into prehistorical (before history began to be recorded) and historical periods (when written records began to be kept).

In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], [[prehistory]] is subdivided around the [[three-age system]]. This list includes the use of the three-age system as well as a number of various designation used in reference to sub-ages within the traditional three.

The dates for each age can vary by region. On the [[geologic time scale]], the [[Holocene]] epoch starts at the end of the [[last glacial period|last glacial period of the current ice age]] (c.10,000 BC) and continues to the present. The beginning of Mesolithic is usually considered to correspond to the beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch.

=== General Periods ===
{{Further|Universal history}}
* '''[[Prehistory|Pre-History]]''' –  Period between the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' ("humans"; [[Oldowan|first stone tools]] &lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; three million years ago) and the invention of writing systems (for the [[Ancient Near East]]: &lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; five thousand years ago).
** '''[[Stone Age]]''' 
*** [[Paleolithic]] – is the earliest period of the Stone Age 
****[[Lower Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; time of [[archaic human]] species, predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]''
****[[Middle Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; coexistence of archaic and [[anatomically modern human]] species
****[[Upper Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; [[Early human migrations|worldwide expansion]] of anatomically modern humans, disappearance of archaic humans by extinction or [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|admixture]] with modern humans; earliest [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|evidence for pictorial art]].
*** [[Mesolithic]] ([[Epipaleolithic]]) – was a period in the development of human technology between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods.
*** [[Neolithic]] – a period of primitive [[technological]] and [[social]] development, beginning about 10,200 BC in parts of the Middle East, and later in other parts of the world.
*** [[Chalcolithic]] (or "Eneolithic", "Copper Age") – this period was still largely Neolithic in character, where early [[copper]] metallurgy appeared alongside the use of stone tools.
** '''[[Bronze Age]]''' – is not part of prehistory for all regions and civilizations who had adopted or developed a writing system.
** '''[[Iron Age]]''' – is not part of prehistory for all civilizations who had introduced written records during the Bronze Age. 
*'''[[Protohistory]]''' – Period between prehistory and history, during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing but other cultures have already noted its existence in their own writings; the absolute time scale of "protohistory" varies widely depending on the region, from the late 4th millennium BCE in the Ancient Near East to the present in the case of [[uncontacted peoples]].
* '''[[Ancient history|Ancient History]]''' – Aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly less than five thousand years, beginning with the earliest linguistic records in the third millennium BC in [[Sumer|Mesopotamia]] and [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Egypt]].
**'''[[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]''' –  Broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], collectively known as the [[Greco-Roman world]]. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
* '''[[Post-classical history|Post-Classical History]]''' – Period of time that immediately followed ancient history.  Depending on the continent, the era generally falls between the years CE 200–600 and CE 1200–1500. The major classical civilizations the era follows are [[Han dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651). 
** '''[[Middle Ages]]''' (also called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]) – Lasted from the 5th to the 14th century. It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and is variously demarcated by historians as ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, merging into the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].
*** [[Early Middle Ages]]
*** [[High Middle Ages]]
*** [[Late Middle Ages]]
* '''[[Modern history|Modern History]]''' – After the post-classical era
**'''[[Early modern period|Early Modern Period]]''' – The chronological limits of this period are open to debate. It emerges from the [[Late Middle Ages]] (c. 1500), demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, in forms such as the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the West, the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the East, and the rise of the [[Aztec]] in the New World. The period ends with the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]].
** [[Modern history#Late modern period 2|'''Late Modern Period''']] – Began approximately in the mid-18th century; notable historical milestones included the [[French Revolution]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Great Divergence]].

* '''[[Hunter-gatherer|Hunter / Gatherer]]:''' tribal societies have yet to develop large scale agriculture and so their survival is a daily struggle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* '''Proto-Democracy:''' there is usually no concept of "leadership" yet. So tribes are led by the best warrior if there is war, the best diplomat if they have steady contact with other tribes and so forth.

===Slave Society===
'''The Second Stage:''' may be called [[Slavery|slave society]], considered to be the beginning of "class society" where private property appears. 
* '''[[Social class|Class]]:''' here the idea of class appears. There is always a slave-owning [[ruling class]] and the slaves themselves.
* '''[[Statism]]:''' the state develops during this stage as a tool for the slave-owners to use and control the slaves.
* '''[[Agriculture]]:''' people learn to cultivate plants and animals on a large enough scale to support large populations.
* '''[[Democracy]] &amp;''' '''[[Authoritarianism]]:''' these opposites develop at the same stage. Democracy arises first with the development of the republican city-state, followed by the totalitarian empire.
* '''[[Property|Private Property]]:''' citizens now own more than personal property. Land ownership is especially important during a time of agricultural development.

=== Feudalism ===
'''The Third Stage:''' may be called [[feudalism]]; it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European [[Middle Ages]] when society went from slavery to feudalism.
* '''[[Aristocracy]]:''' the state is ruled by monarchs who inherit their positions, or at times marry or conquer their ways into leadership.
* '''[[Theocracy]]:''' this is a time of largely religious rule. When there is only one religion in the land and its organizations affect all parts of daily life.
* '''[[Hereditary title|Hereditary Classes]]:''' [[caste]]s can sometimes form and one's class is determined at birth with no form of advancement. This was the case with [[India]].
* '''[[Nation-state]]:''' nations are formed from the remnants of the fallen empires. Sometimes, they rebuild themselves into empires once more; this was the case with England's transition from a [[Roman province|province]] to an [[British Empire|empire]].

===Capitalism===
[[Capitalism]] may be considered '''The Fourth Stage''' in the sequence. Marx pays special attention to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism, which in western society classically arose "red in tooth and claw" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism, the [[profit motive]] rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect wealth.

Capitalism appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrow the feudal system, and it is categorized by the following:
* '''[[Market economy|Market Economy]]:''' In capitalism, the entire economy is guided by market forces. Supporters of [[laissez-faire]] economics argue that there should be little or no intervention from the government under capitalism. Marxists, however, such as Lenin in his ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', argue that the capitalist government is a powerful instrument for the furtherance of capitalism and the capitalist nation-state, particularly in the conquest of markets abroad.
* '''[[Private property|Private Property]]:''' The [[means of production]] are no longer in the hands of the monarchy and its nobles, but rather they are controlled by the capitalists. The capitalists control the means of production through commercial enterprises (such as [[corporation]]s) which aim t/o maximise profit.
* '''[[Parliamentary democracy|Parliamentary Democracy]]:''' The capitalists tend to govern through an elected centralised parliament or congress, rather than under an autocracy. Capitalist (bourgeois) democracy, although it may be extended to the whole population, does not necessarily lead to [[universal suffrage]]. Historically it has excluded (by force, segregation, legislation or other means) sections of the population such as women, slaves, ex-slaves, people of colour or those on low income. The government acts on behalf of, and is controlled by, the capitalists through various methods.
* '''[[Wages]]:''' In capitalism, workers are rewarded according to their contract with their employer. Power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which workers are paid for precisely the value of their services.  In reality workers are paid less than the value of their productivity — the difference forming profit for the employer.  In this sense all paid employment is exploitation and the worker is "alienated" from their work.  Insofar as the profit-motive drives the market, it is impossible for workers to be paid for the full value of their labour, as all employers will act in the same manner.
* '''[[Imperialism]]:''' Wealthy countries seek to dominate poorer countries in order to gain access to raw materials and to provide captive markets for finished products. This is done directly through war, the threat of war, or the export of capital. The capitalist's control over the state can play an essential part in the development of capitalism, to the extent the state directs warfare and other foreign intervention.
* '''[[Financial institution|Financial Institution]]s:''' [[Bank]]s and capital markets such as [[stock exchange]]s direct unused capital to where it is needed.  They reduce barriers to entry in all markets, especially to the poor; it is in this way that banks dramatically improve class mobility.
* '''[[Monopoly|Monopolistic Tendencies]]:''' The natural, unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful commercial entities.

But according to Marx, capitalism, like slave society and feudalism, also has critical failings — inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall. The working class, to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is the "grave digger" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the "unpaid labour of the working class."  The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class, through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production

===Socialism===
After the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, [[socialism (Marxism)|socialism]], which may be considered '''The Fifth Stage''', will be attained, if the workers are successful. [[Marxism|Marxist Socialism]] may be characterised as follows:
* '''[[Commons|Common Property]]:''' the [[means of production]] are taken from the hands of a few capitalists and put in the hands of the workers. This translates into the democratic communes controlling the means of production.
* '''[[Council democracy|Council Democracy]]:''' Marx, basing himself on a thorough study of [[The Civil War in France|Paris Commune]], believed that the workers would govern themselves through system of communes. He called this the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], which, overthrowing the dictatorship (governance) of capital, would democratically plan production and the resources of the planet.

Marx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of communism, would be "in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges", each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although fully supported by social provision.

== Geologic Time Periods ==
{{main|Geologic time scale|List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points}}
The [[geologic time scale]] covers the extent of the existence of Earth, from about 4600 million years ago to the present day. It is marked by [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]]. Geologic time units are (in order of descending specificity) eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages; and the corresponding [[Chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] units, which measure "rock-time", are eonothems, erathems, systems, series, and stages.

The second and third timelines are each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks. The Cenozoic is sometimes divided into the [[Quaternary]] and [[Tertiary]] periods, although the latter is no longer used officially.

The '''long 19th century''' is a term coined for the period between the years 1789 and 1914 by Russian literary critic and author [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/long-centuries/ |title=Long Centuries |publisher=the-tls.co.uk |date= April 29, 2011  |author= Gasan Gusejnov |accessdate= December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian and author [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The concept is an adaption of [[Fernand Braudel]]'s 1949 notion of ''le long seizième siècle'' ("the long 16th century" 1450–1640).&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. (1972). The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II

New York: Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; and "a recognized category of [[History of literature|literary history]]", although a period often broadly and diversely defined by different scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slu.edu/Documents/arts_sciences/english/Long%2019th%20Century.pdf |title=Long 19th Century |publisher=slu.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous authors, before and after Hobsbawm's 1995 publication, have applied similar forms of book titles or descriptions to indicate a selective time frame for their works, such as: S. Kettering, "French Society: 1589–1715 –  the long seventeenth century", E. Anthony Wrigley, "British population during the ‘long’ eighteenth century, 1680–1840", or D. Blackbourn, "The long nineteenth century: A history of Germany, 1780–1918".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treasedademin.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/26032413.pdf |title=French Society: 1589–1715 |publisher=treasedademin |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/wrigley/ |title=Department of Geography, Cambridge » Tony Wrigley – British population during the 'long' eighteenth century, 1680-1840 |publisher=Geog.cam.ac.uk |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=2349 |title=H-Net Reviews - David Blackbourn.

Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848]]'' (1962), ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875]]'' (1975), and ''[[The Age of Empire: 1875–1914]]'' (1987). Hobsbawn starts his long 19th century with the [[French Revolution]], which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the [[outbreak of World War I]], upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring [[European balance of power|European power balance]] of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.  In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, ''[[The Age of Extremes|The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991]]'' (1994), Hobsbawm details [[Short twentieth century|the short 20th century]] beginning with [[World War I]] and ending with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]].

A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by [[Peter N. Stearns]] in the context of the [[world history]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|title=World Civilizations: The Global Experience|year=2011|publisher=[[Longman]]|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-136020-4|edition=6th|author2=Michael Adas|author3=Stuart B. Schwartz|author4=Marc Jason Gilbert|authorlink=Peter Stearns|authorlink2=Michael Adas|authorlink3=Stuart B. Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the [[history of the Catholic Church]], the long 19th century was a period of centralization of [[Papacy|papal]] power over the [[Catholic Church]]. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals.  The church's long 19th century extended from the [[French Revolution#Revolution and the Church|French Revolution]] (1789) until the death of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Malley | first = John W. | author-link = John W.

'''''Man Into Wolf; An Anthropological Interpretation of Sadism, Masochism and Lycanthropy''''' is a book by [[Robert Eisler]], published in 1948 . The text is based upon his readings in [[archeology]] and [[anthropology]]; anything not covered by these disciplines is then dealt with using [[Jungian]] methods of [[Dream analysis#Jung|dream analysis]] and the theory of [[Archetypes#Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].

Eisler begins with an investigation into [[sadism and masochism]] which concludes that people seek not pleasure so much as strong sensations. Whether one seeks strong pleasurable sensations, unpleasurable ones, or some combination thereof depends on which group of apes one is descended from.

He asserts that humanity [[evolution|evolved]] from two groups of [[apes]]: one peaceful, [[vegetarian]] and practicing [[free love]]; the other violent, [[Carnivores|carnivorous]] and given to fighting over [[sex partner]]s. Originally all were of the former group. However, Eisler argues that [[Ice Age]] food shortages caused some to imitate [[wolves]] and other beasts of prey, wearing animal skins and taking up [[hunting]]. He claims this is the historical basis of the [[werewolf]] [[legend]]s found in many cultures.

Eisler advocates a return to what he imagines was the harmonious life of the earliest primates and proposes the development of a new [[psychology]] and ultimately a new society, lest we are destroyed in a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] brought about by descendants of the wolf-men.

'''Marxism''' is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that views [[Social class|class]] relations and [[social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].

Marxism uses a methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of [[capitalism]] and the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic change.

According to Marxist theory, class conflict arises in [[Capitalism|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed [[proletariat]]—a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services—and the [[bourgeoisie]]—the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extract their wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] ([[Profit (economics)|profit]]) produced by the proletariat.

This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. This crisis culminates in a [[proletarian revolution]] and eventually leads to the establishment of [[socialism]]—a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, Marx hypothesized that socialism would ultimately transform into a [[communist society]]; a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and the underlying principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".

Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, though now there is no single definitive Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=130|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched.

== Overview ==
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883)]]
Marxism analyzes the material conditions and the economic activities required to fulfill human material needs to explain [[social phenomena]] within any given society.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena—including social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]].

As [[forces of production]], i.e. [[technology]], improve, existing forms of social organization become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: "At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution".&lt;ref&gt;''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859). Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society in the form of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomic"&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who own the [[means of production]] and the vast majority of the population (the [[proletariat]]) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]].

[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote "Men make their own history". ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'' (1852).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a socialist society, [[private property]]—in the form of the means of production—would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs—that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: "Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

The materialist theory of history&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 53; Marx's account of the theory is the Preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm]. Another exposition of the theory is in ''The German Ideology''. It, too, is available online from [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology marxists.org].&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways that humans make their living. All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the [[base and superstructure]].

The base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: "The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political "forms of social consciousness" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is reflexive, as at first the base gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization, hence that formed social organization can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that the relationship is not static but a [[dialectic]], expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarified: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:&lt;ref&gt;Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history as historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche generale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". Letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'' (1877). He explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive communism]]: as in co-operative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] society: a development of tribal to city-state; aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocrats are the ruling class; merchants evolve into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat.

=== Criticism of capitalism ===
{{further|Opposition to capitalism|Criticism of capitalism}}
According to the Marxist theoretician and [[revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]], "the principal content of Marxism" was "Marx's economic doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that "the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are&amp;nbsp;... one and the same", therefore he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that "the fastest possible growth of productive [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar49|Marx 1849]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploitation is a matter of [[surplus labour]]—the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of the other classes.

In capitalism, the [[labor theory of value|labour theory of value]] is the operative concern; the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, [[surplus value]] (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term "surplus labour", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker.

In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the "voluntary" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.
&lt;!-- Production, not circulation. Marx emphasised that capitalism (''per se'') does not cheat the worker. --&gt;

[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] is the estrangement of people from their humanity (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; ''Gattungswesen'', "species-essence", "species-being"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers.&lt;ref&gt;"Alienation" entry, ''A Dictionary of Sociology''&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism—his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.

=== Social classes ===
{{main|Marxian class theory}}
{{see also|Social class|Class conflict|Classless society|Three-component theory of stratification}}
Marx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of [[means of production]] and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:
* [[Proletariat]]: "[...] the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their [[labour power]] in order to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|authorlink1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat because the workers' labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the workers' [[wages]].
* [[Bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.
** [[Petite bourgeoisie]] are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers and the like. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.
* [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in international or national economics affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.
* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.
* [[Peasantry]] and [[farmers]]: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.

[[Class consciousness]] denotes the awareness—of itself and the social world—that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Without defining [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney: ''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, "ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a [[false consciousness]]. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces".&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London 14 July 1893), Donna Torr, translator, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In ''The German Ideology'', he says "[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''The German Ideology''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[political economy]]" initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity.

{{quote box|quote=Marxism taught me what society was. I was like a blindfolded man in a forest, who doesn't even know where north or south is.

This new way of thinking was invented because socialists believed that common ownership of the "means of production" (that is the industries, the land, the wealth of nature, the trade apparatus, the wealth of the society, etc.) will abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.

Marx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labor is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labor costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest mount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.

Through [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is property of the society as whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, the state, which has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, [[Withering away of the state|will disappear as its conditions of existence have disappeared]].&lt;ref name="Origins of the Family- Chapter IX"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm |title=Origins of the Family- Chapter IX|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZhaoDickson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jianmin Zhao|author2=Bruce J.

== Revolution, socialism and communism ==
[[File:Madrid may day375.jpg|thumb|Leftist protester wielding a [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a [[raised fist]], both are symbols of revolutionary socialism.]]
According to [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist theory]], the overthrow of capitalism by a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity, if not inevitable. Marxists believe that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] of 1917, Lenin wrote: "The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society&amp;nbsp;... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the 1905 revolution and the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of World War One led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] towards an appreciation of Marx's [[crisis theory]] and efforts to formulate a theory of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Samezo Kuruma (September 1929).

== Classical Marxism ==
{{main|Classical Marxism}}
"Classical Marxism" denotes the collection of socio-eco-political theories expounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. "Marxism", as [[Ernest Mandel]] remarked, "is always open, always critical, always self-critical". As such, classical Marxism distinguishes between "Marxism" as broadly perceived and "what Marx believed", thus in 1883 Marx wrote to the French labour leader [[Jules Guesde]] and to Marx's son-in-law [[Paul Lafargue]]—both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles—accusing them of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and of denying the value of reformist struggle.

From Marx's letter derives the paraphrase:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref&gt;"Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of 'revolutionary phrase-mongering' and of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, 'ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste' ('what is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist')". See [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/parti-ouvrier.htm "Programme of the French Worker's Party"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall|first=Stuart|author2=Dave Morely|author3=Kuan-Hsing Chen|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-08803-9|page=418|accessdate=4 March 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EPENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA418|quote=I have no hesitation in saying that this represents a gigantic crudification and simplification of Marx's work – the kind of simplification and reductionism which once led him, in despair, to say "if that is marxism, then I am not a marxist"}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;American Marxist scholar [[Hal Draper]] responded to this comment by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".&lt;ref&gt;Not found in search function at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/index.htm Draper Arkiv].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, the book ''Communism: The Great Misunderstanding'' argues that the source of such misrepresentations lies in ignoring the philosophy of Marxism, which is dialectical materialism. In large, this was due to the fact that ''[[The German Ideology]]'', in which Marx and Engels developed this philosophy, did not find a publisher for almost one hundred years.

[[File:Gordon Childe.jpg|thumb|One of the 20th century's most prominent Marxist academics, the Australian archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]]]]
Marxism has been adopted by a large number of academics and other scholars working in various disciplines.

The [[Archaeological theory|theoretical development]] of [[Marxist archaeology]] was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894–1976) published a report entitled "For a Soviet history of material culture". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 326–40.&lt;/ref&gt; These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic [[V. Gordon Childe]] (1892–1957), who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre81|Green 1981]]. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist sociology]] is the study of [[sociology]] from a Marxist perspective.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Allan G. Johnson, ''The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183-84 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist sociology is "a form of [[conflict theory]] associated with&amp;nbsp;... Marxism's objective of developing a [[Positivism (sociology)|positive]] ([[empirical]]) science of [[capitalist]] [[society]] as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary [[working class]]".&lt;ref name="encofsoc"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/marxist-sociology-eos-03/ "Marxist Sociology"], ''Encyclopedia of Sociology'', Macmillan Reference, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Sociological Association]] has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is "interested in examining how insights from Marxist [[methodology]] and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society".&lt;ref name="section"&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html About the Section on Marxist Sociology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001255/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]]. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see [[sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see [[sociology in China]]).

[[Marxian economics]] refers to a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical [[political economy]] first expounded upon by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0801834806|page=130|quote=Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of [[Crisis theory|crisis]] in [[capitalism]], the role and distribution of the [[surplus product]] and [[surplus value]] in various types of [[economic system]]s, the nature and origin of [[Value (economics)|economic value]], the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of [[Evolutionary economics|economic evolution]]. Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]], such as [[creative destruction]], have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.

[[Marxist historiography]] is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism.  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] are considered the founding fathers of  Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]], most of whom are now over 75 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist literary criticism]] is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Marxist aesthetics]] is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]].

According to a 2007 survey of American professors by [[Neil Gross]] and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Neil |last2=Simmons |first2=Solon |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |date=2007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===
{{main|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Engels]]]]
Karl Marx (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a [[German philosopher]], political economist and socialist revolutionary who addressed the matters of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the working class, the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels (28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.

After Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his ''[[Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884)&amp;nbsp;– analysing [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[marriage]] as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class—Engels made [[intellectual]]ly significant contributions to [[feminist theory]] and [[Marxist feminism]].

=== Late 20th century===
[[File:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fidel Castro]] at the UN General Assembly, 1960]]
In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the victory of [[Fidel Castro]] and his [[July 26 Movement]]. Although the revolution was not explicitly [[socialist]], upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and adopted the [[Leninist]] model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Col03|Coltman 2003]] and [[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (1928–1967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]] and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.

In the People's Republic of China, the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to ameliorate capitalist elements of Chinese society and achieve socialism. However, upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978–1992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberal]] capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics—championed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and U.K. Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]—led the west to take a more aggressive stand against the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]] in the Soviet Union, led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|state's dissolution]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist–Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.

=== 21st century ===
[[File:Hugo-Chavéz Vota.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Chavez]] casting a vote in 2007 ]]
[[File:VISITA DE ESTADO - XI JINPING (30930224182).jpg|thumb|right|[[Xi Jinping]] in 2016]]
At the turn of the 21st century, China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam remained the only officially Marxist–Leninist states remaining, although a Maoist government led by [[Prachanda]] was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle.

The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the "[[pink tide]]". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of [[Hugo Chávez]], this trend also saw the election of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist–Leninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory.

For Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo in his 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', "this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the [[Bolivarian missions]]. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply".&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese President]] [[Xi Jinping]] has announced a deepening commitment of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to the ideas of Marx. At an event celebrating the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Xi said “We must win the advantages, win the initiative, and win the future. We must continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyse and solve practical problems...” also adding “powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world, grasp the law, seek the truth, and change the world,”. Xi has further stressed the importance of examining and continuing the tradition of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] and embrace its revolutionary past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-marx-china/no-regrets-xi-says-marxism-still-totally-correct-for-china-idUSKBN1I50ET|title=No regrets: Xi says Marxism still 'totally correct' for China|first=Christian|last=Shepherd|publisher=|newspaper=Reuters|date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/17/asia/xi-jinping-marxism-china-intl/index.html|title=At the height of his power, China's Xi Jinping moves to embrace Marxism|first=Steven Jiang|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1270109/chinas-communist-party-and-xi-jinping-are-celebrating-the-200th-birthday-of-karl-marx-with-a-vengeance/|title=China's huge celebrations of Karl Marx are not really about Marxism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticisms of Marxism}}
{{see also|Criticisms of socialism|Criticisms of communist party rule}}
Criticisms of Marxism have come from various political ideologies and academic disciplines. These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title =Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes. Essays in Persuasion. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. 1991. p. 300 {{ISBN|978-0-393-00190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Marxists have criticised the academic [[institution]]alisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: "Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection&amp;nbsp;... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cal10|Callinicos 2010]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|date=1973|title=The Mirror of Production}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or [[social theory]]. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as [[Max Weber]]—the [[Frankfurt School]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|editor1-last=Nealon|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Irr|editor2-first=Caren|title=Rethinking the Frankfurt School: Alternative Legacies of Cultural Critique|date=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=11–30|chapter=The Theoretical Hesitation: Benjamin's Sociological Predecessor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General criticisms ===
Philosopher and historian of ideas [[Leszek Kołakowski]] pointed out that "Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles". Specifically, he considers "the laws of dialectics" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means" and some just "nonsense". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2005|isbn=9780393329438|location=New York|pages=662, 909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Okishio's theorem]] shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 7, sects. II–IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Kliman argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kliman states that "Marx’s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence––but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx’s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx’s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] ("The Return of Karl Marx," ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 20 &amp; 27, 1997, p. 252): "His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and empirical critiques ===
Marx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], criticized the [[explanatory power]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of historical materialism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org|title=Science as Falsification|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|date=1963|website=stephenjaygould.org.|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into [[pseudoscientific]] dogma.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist critiques ===
[[Democratic socialist]]s and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations—rooted in Marxism's "scientific" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors—has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.

After Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself—a notable example is the splitting of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]]. [[Orthodox Marxist]]s became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] Marxism.

=== Anarchist and libertarian critiques ===
{{main|Libertarian socialism|Libertarian Marxism}}
[[Anarchism]] has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]], claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent.&lt;ref name=Bakunin1872&gt;{{citation|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Letter to ''La Liberté'', quoted in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971|date=5 October 1872|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/la-liberte.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrases "barracks socialism" or "[[barracks communism]]" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of [[conscript]]s in a [[barracks]].&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|year=2013|title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|postscript=.|isbn=9780871403544}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism "Marxism in practice", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas, while he also acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the [[council communism]] of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Anton Pannekoek]]. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see [[political positions of Noam Chomsky]]).

Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its derivatives such as [[Stalinism]], [[Ceaușism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal.

=== Economic critiques ===
Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. [[Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev]] writing in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), ''Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz]] writing in 1906–1907&lt;ref&gt;Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906–1907), "Value and Price in the Marxian System", ''International Economic Papers'' 2, 5–60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), "On the Correction of Marx's Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of ''Capital''". In Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]] in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications.&lt;ref&gt;Sennholz, Hans F. [https://mises.org/daily/3910/What-We-Can-Know-About-the-World "What We Can Know About The World"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Mises, Ludwig. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Omnipotent_Government.html?id=QoOMaqfdpT4C "Omnipotent Government"].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered by [[Carl Menger]], a development that fundamentally undermined the British cost theories of value. The restoration of subjectivism and [[praxeological]] methodology previously used by classical economists including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]] led Menger to criticise [[historicist]] methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive, with [[Gottfried Haberler]] arguing that Böhm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Haberler]] in [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] (ed.), ''Marxist Ideology in the Contemporary World – Its Appeals and Paradoxes'' (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Third-generation Austrian [[Ludwig von Mises]] rekindled debate about the [[economic calculation problem]] by identifying that without price signals in capital goods, all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare that "rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=9 August 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|date=1990|format=PDF|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Robinson |first2=James A. |title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism |journal=NBER Working Paper Series |date=December 2014 |url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w20766.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4346">The '''Molière authorship question''' is a controversy started in 1919 when [[Pierre Louÿs]], in two articles titled "Corneille est-il l'auteur d'Amphitryon ?" ("Is Corneille the author of ''[[Amphitryon (Molière)|Amphitryon]]''?") and "Molière est un chef-d'œuvre de Corneille" ("Molière is a masterpiece by Corneille"), claimed that he had uncovered a literary hoax. According to him, [[Molière]] had not written his own plays and had had [[Pierre Corneille]] for a [[ghostwriter]]; or, more precisely, Molière was a proxy for Corneille, following a practice which Louÿs believed was common but which one in fact does not encounter in 17th Century literature except for pamphlets and some collections of scholarly jokes around the turn of the century.

Louÿs therefore wrote in line with two recent publications by [[Abel Lefranc]], a professor at the [[Collège de France]], who had contributed to discussion of the [[Shakespeare authorship question]] by publishing one by one in 1918 and 1919 the two volumes of a book titled ''Sous le masque de William Shakespeare : William Stanley, VIe comte de Derby'', propounding the [[Derbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship]]. Louÿs, who had himself, throughout his career, published a number of works under different pseudonyms&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Goujon, ''Pierre Louÿs'', Fayard, 2002, 872 p.&lt;/ref&gt;—he had even made his name by passing off his ''[[The Songs of Bilitis]]'' as an original collection of Greek poems translated by him—but had not in his vast correspondence suggested any possible link between Molière and Corneille,&lt;ref&gt;''Pierre Louÿs'' by Goujon, p. 745 and following&lt;/ref&gt; jumped at the chance to transpose onto Molière the doubt that some English-speaking authors (well before Abel Lefranc) had expressed about Shakespeare and to lend thus to Corneille the same taste for pseudonymity.

This contention, which attracted interest from time to time through the 20th Century after the splash made by Louÿs, has been renewed at the beginning of the 2000s, notably with the publication in a scientific journal of two articles attempting to use [[stylometry|stylometric analysis]] to show the closeness of vocabulary and syntax between Corneille and Molière; but, in both cases, the inquiry was not expanded to other authors of comedies in the 17th Century to verify whether the similarity between Corneille and Molière is any greater than with their other contemporaries. As in the case of Shakespeare, this theory is rejected by all experts on Corneille&lt;ref&gt;See for example the conclusion of André Le Gall in the most recent biography of Corneille (Flammarion, 1997): "Il n'est pas inconcevable que Molière ait confié ses manuscrits à Corneille afin qu'il y jette un œil. […] Cette hypothèse-là, purement hypothétique, mais conforme à la nature des liens qui peuvent se tisser entre un auteur et son metteur en scène, n'ôte en rien à Molière la paternité de ses œuvres" (p.473); see also, as of 2011, the objection published by the community of Corneille scholars: http://www.corneille.org/index.php?lng=fr&lt;/ref&gt; and Molière,&lt;ref&gt;See for example the conclusion of Roger Duchêne in the most recent biography of Molière (Fayard, 1998): "Devant ce tissu d'inventions, d'approximations et d'erreurs qui ne convainquent que ceux qui aiment le sensationnel et se laissent emporter par l'imagination et l'éloquence d'un auteur de romans, on reste confondu en voyant que l'idée continue de faire son chemin et à trouver des défenseurs au fil du temps." (p.162); see also, as of 2011, the site [http://www.moliere-corneille.paris-sorbonne.fr "Molière auteur des œuvres de Molière"] created by the editors of the new edition of Molière's ''Œuvres complètes'' in the [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]], published in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as historians of literature and French drama generally, who do not even mention it.&lt;ref&gt;See the most recent history of French drama: Charles Mazouer, ''Le Théâtre français de l'âge classique'', Paris, Champion, 2 vol. (2006 et 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29785">{{About|the modern myth that medieval Europeans believed that Earth was flat|mythologies involving the actual belief in a Flat Earth|Flat Earth}}
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|270px|The famous "Flat Earth" [[Flammarion engraving]] originates with Flammarion's 1888 ''L'atmosphère: météorologie populaire'' (p. 163)]]

The '''myth of the flat Earth''' is a modern misconception that Earth was widely believed to be [[flat Earth|flat]] rather than [[spherical Earth|spherical]] during the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe.{{sfn|Russell|1991|p=3}}{{sfn|Russell|1997}}

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], virtually all scholars maintained the spherical viewpoint, which had been first expressed by the Ancient Greeks. From at least the 14th century, belief in a flat Earth among educated Europeans was almost nonexistent, despite fanciful depictions in art, such as the exterior of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s famous triptych ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', in which a disc-shaped Earth is shown floating inside a transparent sphere.{{sfn|Gombrich|1969|pp=162–170}}

According to [[Stephen Jay Gould]], "there never was a period of 'flat Earth darkness' among scholars (regardless of how the public at large may have conceptualized our planet both then and now). Greek knowledge of sphericity never faded, and all major medieval scholars accepted the Earth's roundness as an established fact of cosmology."{{sfn|Gould|1997}} Historians of science [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] and [[Ronald Numbers]] point out that "there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference".{{sfn|Lindberg|Numbers|1986|pp=338–354}}

Historian [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] says the flat-Earth error flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over biological evolution. Russell claims "with extraordinary few exceptions no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the Earth was flat", and ascribes popularization of the flat-Earth myth to histories by [[John William Draper]], [[Andrew Dickson White]], and [[Washington Irving]].{{sfn|Russell|1997}}{{sfn|Russell|1991}}{{sfn|Russell|1993}}

== History ==
In ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth|Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians]]'', Jeffrey Russell describes the Flat Earth theory as a fable used to [[wikt:impugn|impugn]] pre-modern civilization and [[creationism]].{{sfn|Russell|1991}}{{sfn|Russell|1997}}

James Hannam wrote:

{{bq|1=The myth that people in the Middle Ages thought the Earth is flat appears to date from the 17th century as part of the campaign by Protestants against Catholic teaching.  But it gained currency in the 19th century, thanks to inaccurate histories such as John William Draper's ''History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science'' (1874) and Andrew Dickson White's ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (1896). Atheists and agnostics championed the [[conflict thesis]] for their own purposes, but historical research gradually demonstrated that Draper and White had propagated more fantasy than fact in their efforts to prove that science and religion are locked in eternal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;James Hannam. [http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Science-Versus-Christianity.html "Science Versus Christianity?"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early modern period===
French dramatist [[Cyrano de Bergerac (writer)|Cyrano de Bergerac]] in chapter 5 of his ''[[Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon]]'' (published 2 years posthumously in 1657) quotes [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] as saying "that in his day and age the Earth was as flat as a stove lid and that it floated on water like half of a sliced orange."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bewilderingstories.com/issue29/cyrano5.html The Other World The Societies and Governments of the Moon], translated by Donald Webb&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], in his ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]''&lt;ref name=burton&gt;Second Partition, Section 2, Member 3 "Air Rectified. With a Digression of the Air" [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10800/10800-8.txt The Anatomy of Melancholy]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:
{{bq|1=[[Vergilius of Salzburg|Virgil]], sometime bishop of Salzburg (as Aventinus ''anno'' 745 relates), by [[Saint Boniface|Bonifacius]], bishop of [[Mainz|Mentz]], was therefore called in question, because he held antipodes (which they made a doubt whether Christ died for) and so by that means took away the seat of hell, or so contracted it, that it could bear no proportion to heaven, and contradicted that opinion of Austin [St. Augustine], Basil, Lactantius, that held the Earth round as a [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]] (whom [[José de Acosta|Acosta]] and common experience more largely confute) but not as a ball.}}

Thus, there is evidence that accusations of Flatearthism, though somewhat whimsical (Burton ends his digression with a legitimate quotation of St. Augustine: "Better doubt of things concealed, than to contend about uncertainties, where Abraham's bosom is, and hell fire"&lt;ref name=burton/&gt;) were used to discredit opposing authorities several centuries before the 19th. Another early mention in literature is [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s comedy ''Erasmus Montanus'' (1723). Erasmus Montanus meets considerable opposition when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants hold it to be flat. He is not allowed to marry his fiancée until he cries "The earth is flat as a pancake". In Thomas Jefferson's book ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1784), framed as answers to a series of questions (queries), Jefferson uses the "Query" regarding religion to attack the idea of state-sponsored official religions. In the chapter, Jefferson relates a series of official erroneous beliefs about nature forced upon people by authority. One of these is the episode of [[Galileo]]'s struggles with authority, which Jefferson erroneously frames in terms of the shape of the globe:&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson, Thomas]]. [http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/notes-on-the-state-of-virginia-query-xvii-religion/ Notes on the State of Virginia, Query regarding RELIGION]. Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|1=Government is just as infallible too when it fixes systems in physics. Galileo was sent to the inquisition for affirming that the Earth was a sphere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]], and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error however at length prevailed, the Earth became a globe, and Descartes declared it was whirled round its axis by a [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|vortex]].}}

===19th century===
The 19th century was a period in which the perception of an antagonism between religion and science was especially strong. The disputes surrounding the [[Reaction to Darwin's theory|Darwinian revolution]] contributed to the birth of the [[conflict thesis]],{{sfn|Gould|1997}} a view of history according to which any interaction between [[religion]] and [[science]] would almost inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Wilson writes about the development of the conflict thesis in "The Historiography of Science and Religion" {{Harvnb|Wilson|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irving's biography of Columbus====
In 1828, Washington Irving's highly romanticised biography, ''[[A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]'',{{sfn|Irving|1861}} was published and mistaken by many for a scholarly work.{{sfn|Russell|1991|pp=51–56}} In Book II, Chapter IV of this biography, Irving gave a largely fictional account of the meetings of a commission established by the Spanish sovereigns to examine [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s proposals. One of his more fanciful embellishments was a highly unlikely tale that the more ignorant and bigoted members on the commission had raised scriptural objections to Columbus's assertions that the Earth was spherical.{{sfn|Irving|1861|p=90}}

The issue in the 1490s was not the shape of the Earth, but its size, and the position of the east coast of Asia, as Irving in fact points out. Historical estimates from [[Ptolemy]] onwards placed the coast of Asia about 180° east of the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy, ''Geography'', book 1:14.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus adopted an earlier (and rejected) distance of 225°, added 28° (based on [[Marco Polo|Marco Polo's]] travels), and then placed [[Japan]] another 30° further east. Starting from [[Cape St. Vincent]] in [[Portugal]], Columbus made [[Eurasia]] stretch 283° to the east, leaving the [[Atlantic]] as only 77° wide. Since he planned to leave from the Canaries (9° further west), his trip to Japan would only have to cover 68° of longitude.{{sfn|Morison|1942|page=65}}{{sfn|Nunn|Edwards|1924|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/geographicalconc00nunn#page/n40/mode/1up 27–30]}}

Columbus mistakenly assumed that the mile referred to in the Arabic estimate of 56⅔ miles for the size of a degree was the same as the actually much shorter Italian mile of {{convert|1,480|m|mi}}.  His estimate for the size of the degree and for the circumference of the Earth was therefore about 25% too small.{{sfn|Nunn|Edwards|1924|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/geographicalconc00nunn#page/n14/mode/1up 1–2], [https://archive.org/stream/geographicalconc00nunn#page/n30/mode/1up 17–18]}} The combined effect of these mistakes was that Columbus estimated the distance to Japan to be only about 5,000&amp;nbsp;km (or only to the eastern edge of the [[Caribbean]]) while the true figure is about 20,000&amp;nbsp;km. The Spanish scholars may not have known the exact distance to the east coast of Asia, but they believed that it was significantly further than Columbus's projection; and this was the basis of the criticism in Spain and Portugal, whether academic or amongst mariners, of the proposed voyage.

The disputed point was not the shape of the Earth, nor the idea that going west would eventually lead to Japan and China, but the ability of European ships to sail that far across open seas. The small ships of the day (Columbus's three ships varied between 20.5 and 23.5 m – or 67 to 77 feet – in length and carried about 90 men) simply could not carry enough food and water to reach Japan. The ships barely reached the eastern Caribbean islands. Already the crews were mutinous, not because of some fear of "sailing off the edge", but because they were running out of food and water with no chance of any new supplies within sailing distance. They were on the edge of starvation.{{sfn|Morison|1942|pp=209, 211}} What saved Columbus was the unknown existence of the Americas precisely at the point he thought he would reach Japan. His ability to resupply with food and water from the Caribbean islands allowed him to return safely to Europe. Otherwise his crews would have died, and the ships foundered.

====Advocates for science====

In 1834, a few years after the publication of Irving's book, [[Jean Antoine Letronne]], a French academic of strong antireligious ideas, misrepresented the [[church fathers]] and their medieval successors as believing in a flat earth in his ''On the Cosmographical Ideas of the Church Fathers''.{{sfn|Russell|1997}}{{sfn|Letronne|1883}} Then in 1837, the English philosopher of science [[William Whewell]], in his ''History of the Inductive Sciences'', identified [[Lactantius]], author of ''Institutiones Divinae'' (c. 310), and [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], author of ''[[Christian Topography]]'' (c. 548), as evidence of a medieval belief in a Flat Earth. Lactantius had been ridiculed much earlier by [[Copernicus]] in ''[[De revolutionibus]]'' of 1543 as someone who "Speaks quite childishly about the Earth's shape, when he mocks those who declared that the Earth has the form of a globe".

Other historians quickly followed Whewell, although they could identify few other examples.{{sfn|Gould|1997|p=42}} The American chemist [[John William Draper]] wrote a ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'' (1874), employing the claim that the early Church fathers thought the Earth was flat as evidence of the hostility of the Church to the advancement of science.{{sfn|Garwood|2007|pp=10–11}} The story of widespread religious belief in the flat Earth was repeated by [[Andrew Dickson White]] in his 1876 ''The Warfare of Science''{{sfn|White|1876|pp=10–22}} and elaborated twenty years later in his two-volume ''History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom'', which exaggerated the number and significance of medieval flat Earthers to support White's model of warfare between dogmatic theology and scientific progress.{{sfn|Garwood|2007|pp=12–13}}  As Draper and White's metaphor of ongoing warfare between the scientific progress of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the religious obscurantism of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" became widely accepted, it spread the idea of medieval belief in the flat Earth.{{sfn|Garwood|2007|pp=13–14}}

The widely circulated engraving of a man poking his head through the firmament surrounding the Earth to view the [[Empyrean]], executed in the style of the 16th century, was published in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s ''L'Atmosphère: Météorologie Populaire'' (Paris, 1888, p.&amp;nbsp;163).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/kvmagruder/flatEarth/source.html|title=History_of_Science_Collections&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engraving illustrates the statement in the text that a medieval missionary claimed that "he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met". In its original form, the engraving included a decorative border that places it in the 19th century. In later publications, some of which claimed that the engraving dates to the 16th century, the border was removed.

=== 20th century and onward ===

[[File:Boorstin discoverers.jpg|thumb|right|Front Cover of Daniel Boorstin's ''[[The Discoverers]]'' (1983), bearing a copy of the Flammarion engraving]]
Since the early 20th century, a number of books and articles have documented the flat earth error as one of a number of widespread misconceptions in popular [[Medievalism|views of the Middle Ages]]. Both E.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Tillyard's book ''The Elizabethan World Picture'' and C.&amp;nbsp;S. Lewis' ''The Discarded Image'' are devoted to a broad survey of how the universe was viewed in Renaissance and medieval times, and both extensively discuss how the educated classes knew the world was round. Lewis draws attention to the fact that in Dante's [[Divine Comedy|''The Divine Comedy'']] about an epic voyage through hell, purgatory, and heaven, the earth is spherical with gravity being towards the center of the earth. As the Devil is frozen in a block of ice in the center of the earth, Dante and Virgil climb down the Devil's torso, but up from the Devil's waist to his feet, as his waist is at the center of the earth.

[[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] rebutted the prevalence of belief in the flat Earth in a monograph{{sfn|Russell|1991}} and two papers.{{sfn|Russell|1993}}{{sfn|Russell|1997}} Louise Bishop states that virtually every thinker and writer of the 1000-year medieval period affirmed the spherical shape of the Earth.{{sfn|Bishop|2008|p=99}}

Although the misconception was frequently refuted in historical scholarship since at least 1920, it persisted in popular culture and in some school textbooks into the 21st century. An American schoolbook by Emma Miller Bolenius published in 1919 has this introduction to the suggested reading for [[Columbus Day]] (12 October):
{{bq|1=When Columbus lived, people thought that the earth was flat. They believed the Atlantic Ocean to be filled with monsters large enough to devour their ships, and with fearful waterfalls over which their frail vessels would plunge to destruction. Columbus had to fight these foolish beliefs in order to get men to sail with him. He felt sure the earth was round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bolenius|1919}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Garwood|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Previous editions of [[Thomas A. Bailey|Thomas Bailey]]'s ''[[The American Pageant]]'' stated that "The superstitious sailors [of Columbus's crew]&amp;nbsp;... grew increasingly mutinous&amp;nbsp;... because they were fearful of sailing over the edge of the world"; however, no such historical account is known.{{sfn|Loewen|1996|p=56}} &lt;!-- Can someone confirm whether the 13th edition of The American Pageant (2006) still contains this sentence? --&gt;

A 2009 survey of schoolbooks from Austria and Germany showed that the Flat Earth myth became dominant in the second half of the 20th century and persists in most historical textbooks for German and Austrian schools.{{sfn|Bernhard|2014}}

As recently as 1983 [[Daniel Boorstin]] published a historical survey, ''[[The Discoverers]]'', which presented the Flammarion engraving on its cover and proclaimed that "from AD 300 to at least 1300&amp;nbsp;... Christian faith and dogma suppressed the useful image of the world that had been so&amp;nbsp;... scrupulously drawn by ancient geographers."{{sfn|Boorstin|1983|p=100}} Boorstin dedicated a chapter to the flat earth, in which he portrayed [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] as the founder of Christian geography.{{sfn|Boorstin|1983|pp=108–109}}  The flat earth model has often been incorrectly supposed to be church doctrine by those who wish to portray the Catholic Church as being anti-progress or hostile to scientific inquiry.  This narrative has been repeated even in academic circles, such as in April 2016, when [[Boston College]] theology professor and ex-priest [[Thomas Groome]] erroneously stated that "the Catholic Church never said the earth is round, but just stopped saying it was flat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-long-awaited-document-on-the-family-pope-francis-offers-hope-to-divorced-catholics-says-no-to-gay-marriage/2016/04/07/87be6dae-fb42-11e5-813a-90ab563f0dde_story.html|title=Pope Francis offers hope to divorced Catholics, says no to gay marriage|first=|last=https://www.facebook.com/anthony.faiola|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1937 popular song [[They All Laughed (song)|''They All Laughed'']] contains the couplet "They all laughed at Christopher Columbus/When he said the world was round". In the Warner Bros. ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon ''[[Hare We Go]]'' (1951) Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand the Catholic quarrel about the shape of the Earth; the king states the Earth is flat. In Walt Disney's 1963 animation ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'', wizard [[Merlin]] (who has traveled into the future) explains to [[King Arthur|a young Arthur]] that "man will discover in centuries to come" that the Earth is round, and rotates.

==Historiography of the flat Earth myth==

[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Columbus Before the Council of Salamanca (1487) CropEnh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Columbus Doors|Ornamental door]] (1871) at the US Capitol depicting the Council at Salamanca]]
Historical writers have identified a number of historical circumstances that contributed to the origin and widespread acceptance of the flat-earth myth. American historian [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] traced the nineteenth-century origins of what he called the Flat Error to a group of anticlerical French scholars, particularly to [[Antoine-Jean Letronne]] and, indirectly, to his teachers [[Jean-Baptiste Gail]] and [[Edme Mentelle]]. Mentelle had described the Middle Ages as twelve ignorant centuries of "profound night", a theme exemplified by the flat-earth myth in Letronne's "On the Cosmological Opinions of the Church Fathers".{{sfn|Russell|1993|pp=344–345}}

[[History of science|Historian of science]] [[Edward Grant]] saw a fertile ground for the development of the flat-Earth myth in a more general assault upon the Middle Ages and upon scholastic thought, which can be traced back to [[Francesco Petrarch]] in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Grant|2001|pp=329–345}}  Grant sees "one of the most extreme assaults against the Middle Ages" in [[John William Draper|Draper's]] ''History of the Intellectual Development of Europe'',{{sfn|Grant|2001|p=335}} which appeared a decade before Draper presented the flat-Earth myth in his ''History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science''.{{sfn|Draper|1874|pp=63–65, 154–5, 160–161}}

Andrew Dickson White's motives were more complex.  As the first president of [[Cornell University]], he had advocated that it be established without any religious ties but be "an asylum for science".  In addition, he was a strong advocate for Darwinism, saw religious figures as the main opponents of the Darwinian evolution, and sought to project that conflict of theology and science back through the entire Christian Era.{{sfn|Lindberg|Numbers|1986|pp=338–352}}  But as some historians have pointed out, the nineteenth-century conflict over Darwinism incorporated disputes over the relative authority of professional scientists and clergy in the fields of science and education.{{sfn|Turner|1978}}  White made this concern manifest in the preface to his ''History of the Warfare of Science and Theology in Christendom'', where he explained the lack of advanced instruction in many American colleges and universities by their "sectarian character".{{sfn|White|1917|p=vii}}

The flat-Earth myth, like other myths, took on artistic form in the many works of art displaying Columbus defending the sphericity of the Earth before the Council of [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]]. American artists depicted a forceful Columbus challenging the "prejudices, the mingled ignorance and erudition, and the pedantic bigotry" of the churchmen.  Abrams sees this image of a Romantic hero, a practical man of business, and a Yankee go-getter as crafted to appeal to nineteenth-century Americans.{{sfn|Abrams|1993|p=89}}

Russell suggests that the flat-earth error was able to take such deep hold on the modern imagination because of prejudice and [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]].  He specifically mentions "the Protestant prejudice against the Middle Ages for Being Catholic&amp;nbsp;... the Rationalist prejudice against Judeo-Christianity as a whole", and "the assumption of the superiority of 'our' views to those of older cultures".{{sfn|Russell|1993|p=347}}

'''National Life Stories''' is an independent charitable trust and limited company (registered as the ‘National Life Story Collection’) based within the [[British Library]] Oral History section, whose key focus and expertise is [[oral history]] fieldwork.  Since 1987 National Life Stories (NLS) has initiated a series of innovative interviewing projects funded almost entirely from sponsorship, charitable and individual donations.

Each NLS project is archived at the British Library and comprises recorded in-depth interviews, plus content summaries and (if funds allow) transcripts to assist users.  Alongside the British Library’s oral history collections, which stretch back to the beginning of the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/oralhistory Oral History collections at the British Library]&lt;/ref&gt; NLS recordings form a unique and invaluable record of people’s lives in Britain today.

== History ==
The proposal for NLS was first developed by [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)]] and [[Asa Briggs]] in 1985-6.  The project for a ‘National Life Story Collection’ had a number of distinct features; it was to be a ‘life story’ project intending to collect full autobiographical material including both written autobiographies as well as recorded ‘[[oral history]]’.  And it was intended to 'record first-hand experiences of as wide a cross-section of present-day society as possible'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/nls National Life Stories webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; combining recordings with both elites (who at that time had been largely neglected by British oral historians) and a cross-section of ordinary men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsreports/nlsreport2007.pdf Professor Paul Thompson, ‘Twenty Years of National Life Stories 1987 – 2007’, National Life Stories Review and Accounts 2007/2008 pp18]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1986 Thompson and Briggs recruited a distinguished body of trustees, including [[Baroness Ewart-Biggs]], [[Penelope Lively]], [[Austin Mitchell]], Sir [[Russell Johnston (politician)|Russell Johnson]] MP, [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]], [[Elizabeth Longford]], Professor Peter Laslett, Professor John Saville and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)]].  Advisors included [[Melvyn Bragg]].  Other important early trustees included the property developer Jack Rose and the first Treasurer, Peter Hands.  With Lord Briggs as Chairman and Paul Thompson as Director, an inaugural meeting of the National Life Story Collection (NLS) as a company was held on 11 November 1986, and registration as a charity was obtained in October 1987. &lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=327571&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 Charity Commission, charity overview for National Life Story Collection, 2017].  Retrieved 7 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial endowment funding for NLS came from Paul Thompson’s gift of a Henry Moore sculpture (Working Model For Draped Seated Woman: Figure On Steps), which was sold in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159576102 Sotheby’s Sold Lot Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as donations from the Wingate Foundation and the Nuffield Foundation.  

NLS gained the early support of Dr Christopher Roads, Director of the [[National Sound Archive]] (1983 - 1992) and in return for archiving interviews, NLS was given a free office in the National Sound Archive (then at Exhibition Road, London), materials and technical support.  The appointment of a Curator in Oral History, whose role would be to work closely with the National Life Story Collection, was made in late 1988 (Dr Rob Perks, who took over from Thompson as NLS Director in 1995). The first projects established (all in 1988) were City Lives, The Living Memory of the Jewish Community and Leaders of National Life.  Artists’ Lives, established in 1990, is the longest running continuous project, with more than 350 interviews.  In 2005 National Life Stories was adopted as a trading name.

== Interviewing Methodology ==
NLS was initially conceived to have two spheres of activity.  One sphere was the creation of a ‘Life Story Archive’ of manuscript autobiographies.   However, the main focus was always to be the creation of a ‘National Biography in Sound’, a collection of recorded and transcribed interviews of two kinds; the first was ‘autobiographical interviews with leading British men and women in all fields - politics, industry, administration, the professions, culture or religion’; and interviews with systematic representatives of ordinary citizens, beginning with a national cross-section of all classes and regions, and then concentrating on particular groups in special need of being recorded.  All NLS projects were to follow the in-depth life story approach, starting with family background and childhood, and moving on to education, work and leisure and the community.   This methodology has continued to be followed for projects, and each NLS interview normally averages 8 to 15 hours in length.

== Oral History Programme ==
'''Early Projects'''&lt;br /&gt;
The first NLS project was Leaders of National Life which began in 1988 and which is still added to occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsgen/general.html Leaders of National Life webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  The project aimed to ‘record autobiographical interviews with leading British men and women covering their life experience as a whole’ with subjects selected from all fields – including politics, industry, administration, the professions, culture or religion – in order to achieve a balance.  The project specifically aimed to collect interviews with those life stories had not been recorded or published.  
&lt;br /&gt;
As well as the Leaders of National Life project, which was funded from NLS’s core funds, NLS sought to undertake ‘Special Collections’ with funding sought from professional associations, industry and other institutions - this is the model which has been used ever since.  One of the first of these projects was City Lives, which also began in 1988.  It was led by Paul Thompson (with particularly important help from Sir [[Nicholas Goodison]]) and later by Cathy Courtney.  City Lives was funded entirely from within the City, mostly from smaller donations, but including an especially important grant from the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]].  This project resulted in a unique collection of nearly 150 in-depth interviews of the financial elite of the City of London.  The project culminated in an exhibition of memorabilia and photographic portraits of City interviewees at the [[Bank of England Museum]], and in the publication of the book City Lives: The Changing Voices of British Finance (Methuen, 1996, {{ISBN|0-413-67890-3}}), edited by Cathy Courtney with an introduction by Paul Thompson. A follow-up project, focusing specifically on [[Barings Bank]] (An Oral History of Barings) began in 2009 in partnership with the Baring Archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/barings/barings.html An Oral History of Barings project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another ‘Special Collection’, also begun in 1988, was The Living Memory of the Jewish Community (which ran until 1999);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsjew/jewish.html The Living Memory of the Jewish Community project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; the project was led by Jennifer Wingate and received donations from [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|Lord Young]] and the Clore Foundation.  Although the original concept was broader, the project quickly focused its aims on the recording of Jewish Holocaust survivors in Britain, which at that time had been neglected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsreports/NLSnewsletter2.pdf ‘The Growth of ‘Living Memory of the Jewish Community’, Jennifer Wingate, NLS Newsletter Issue 2: Summer 1999, pp 5-6]&lt;/ref&gt;  This project (helped with funding secured through Martin Paisner and the Edith and Ferdinand Porjes Charitable Trust) culminated with the publication of an educational pack, Voices of the Holocaust (British Library, 1994) edited by Carrie Supple and Rob Perks; the educational pack later became an online web resource on the British Library website, Voices of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/voices/holocaust.html Voices of the Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Visual Arts and Crafts'''&lt;br /&gt;
NLS has shown a strong emphasis on recording those involved in the visual arts and in design in general, from architects to theatre designers.  The first project to concentrate on the arts was Artists’ Lives, which began in 1990 with crucial seed money for five initial interviews provided by the [[Henry Moore Foundation]].  The project, which by 2011 had over 300 interviews, is directed by Cathy Courtney and is run in collaboration with Tate.  Artists’ Lives has concentrated on painters (through grants especially from the Linbury Trust, the Elephant Trust, the [[Pilgrim Trust]], the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and the [[Arts Council England]]) and sculptors (with key support from the Henry Moore Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsart/artistslives.html Artists’ Lives project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  A smaller proportion of interviews have been carried out with ‘art professionals’ (with support from the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]).  The project had had a number of published outputs including the CDs The Sculptor Speaks: Extracts From Recordings With Post-War British Sculptors and Connecting Lines: Artists Talk About Drawing (which is also available online via the British Library’s website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/nls/drawing Connecting Lines: Artists Talk About Drawing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the interviews with no access restrictions are available online to those within UK Higher Education via the [[British Library Sounds]] website.  In addition, all of the open interviews, with no access restrictions, are available to researchers at Tate Archive.  Recordings sponsored by the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] are available at the [[Henry Moore Institute]]; recordings sponsored by the [[Fleming Collection]] are available via the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] archive, and those sponsored by the [[Yale Center for British Art]] are available through their archives.  

Architects’ Lives began in 1990 and at 2011 had interviewed more than 100 architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsarch/architectslives.html Architects’ Lives project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  Crafts Lives began in 1999 and, at 2011 has interviewed over 100 studio crafts practitioners including glass artists, textile artists and furniture makers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlscrafts/crafts.html Crafts Lives project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  Interviews from Architects' Lives and Crafts Lives are available via the [[British Library Sounds]] website.  Other NLS projects concentrating on visual arts and design (but which are no longer in-progress) include An Oral History of British Fashion (2002 – 2007); and An Oral History of British Theatre Design (2005 – 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlstheatre/theatre.html An Oral History of British Theatre Design project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  A project recording the life stories of British Photographers (An Oral History of British Photography) is carried out by the British Library’s Oral History section; some of the interviews with no access restrictions are available online to those within UK Higher Education via the [[British Library Sounds]] website.   

'''Industry and Utilities'''&lt;br /&gt;
NLS has always strived to capture the life stories of those involved in industry.  The original idea was for a project on ‘Industrial Lives’, to collect life story interviews from top industrial management from the 1950s onwards, in both public and private industries.  However, instead of one large project more industry-specific projects emerged.  The first of many projects to focus on British utility companies was Lives in Steel (1991 – 1992), which was funded by the General Division of British Steel through the support of David Grieves.  This project resulted in the recording of 90 interviews by Alan Dein of former and current staff at all levels of the industry from directors to manual workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlssteel/steel.html Lives in Steel project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999 another project focusing on British industry, Lives in the Oil Industry, began, a partnership with the [[University of Aberdeen]], running until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsoil/oil.htm Lives in the Oil Industry project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  The project resulted in an archive of interviews with 177 people involved in all sectors of the industry; a number of [[BBC Radio 4]] Archive Hours have used material from the archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00cd3gs The Archive Hour, Piper Alpha’s Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent project to focus on the British utility industries is An Oral History of the Water Industry, which began in 2009 with sponsorship from Cambridge Water, Northumbria Water, [[Scottish Water]], [[Southern Water]], [[Wessex Water]] and [[Yorkshire Water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/water/water.html An Oral History of the Water project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;
The largest project to focus on one industrial sector was Food: From Source to Salespoint, which ran between 1995 and 2007 and resulted in an archive of over 202 interviews.  The project covered many aspects of the UK food industry, from production through to consumption, and interviewed farmers, butchers, supermarket workers, food technologists and retailers, amongst others.  It received sponsorship from a number of the livery companies as well as UK food manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsfood/food.html  Food: From Source to Salespoint  project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  A supplementary set of recordings with Chefs, generously funded by [[Sir John Craven]], began 2009, and [[Tesco]] funded their own oral history project (but conducted by NLS) between 2003 – 2007 (Tesco: An Oral History&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlstesco/tesco.html Tesco: An Oral History project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;).  An Oral History of the Wine Trade (2003 – 2005), was funded by the [[Vintners' Company]] and the [[Institute of Masters of Wine]], and gathered a further forty interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlswine/wine.html An Oral History of the Wine Trade project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Businesses and Corporations'''&lt;br /&gt;
National Life Stories has worked in partnership with a number of individual businesses and corporations to collect oral histories with employees from all levels of a corporation.  An Oral History of Barings, a project in partnership with the Baring Archive, includes interviews with employees from all levels of the bank, including messengers, secretaries, and one of the bank’s first female senior executives.  Other corporate-specific projects have been undertaken with the brand consultancy [[Wolff Olins]] (An Oral History of Wolff Olins), the [[Royal Mail Group]] and [[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] (An Oral History of the Post Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlspost/postoffice.html An Oral History of the Post Office project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;) and with Tesco (Tesco: An Oral History).

'''Writing and Publishing'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Penelope Lively and Sarah O'Reilly Gaisberg Studio BLCC.jpg|thumb|upright| Sarah O'Reilly (interviewer for Authors’ Lives) and Penelope Lively (interviewed for Authors’ Lives and Trustee of NLS) in the British Library interview studio.]] --&gt;
Book Trade Lives, which was led by [[Martyn Goff]] and which received generous funding from the Unwin Foundation, ran between 1997 and 2006.   The project interviewed nearly 120 of those involved in bookselling from the 1920s through the twentieth century, including secretaries, sales managers, editors and publishers' representatives, and specialists in production and design. A CD featuring extracts from the project entitled Book Trade Lives was published by The British Library in 2002 and over 80 interviews from Book Trade Lives were used in The British Book Trade: An Oral History (British Library, 2008 and 2010), edited by the project interviewer Sue Bradley.   A complimentary project, Authors’ Lives began in 2007, and includes life story interviews with novelists, poets, biographers, historians and children’s writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsauthor/authorslives.html Authors’ Lives project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Writing Life: Authors Speak, a CD containing edited extracts from the collection was published in 2011.  An Oral History of British Press&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlspress/press.html An Oral History of the British Press project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; ran between 1994 and 2006, and collected the life stories of key press and newspaper figures. 

'''Science'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2009 NLS received funding from the Arcadia Fund and the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]] for a new project ([[Oral History of British Science]]).  The project has collected over 100 audio interviews, each 8 to 15 hours in length, with scientists, engineers and others linked with science and technology in Britain, as well as shorter on-location video recordings, over two themed strands: Made in Britain and A Changing Planet. In 2013 National Life Stories began a new oral history project entitled 'Inspiring Scientists: Diversity in British Science', in partnership with the [[Royal Society]] Diversity Programme.  Interviewees range from Professors to PhD students and the focus on science is wide, covering academia, big industry and individual entrepreneurship. Many of the interviews recorded for the projects are available in full on [[British Library Sounds]], while the Voices of Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/voices-of-science Voices of Science web resource]&lt;/ref&gt; web resource provides curated access to audio and video highlights from the interviews organised by theme, discipline and interviewee.

'''Other Projects'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Fawcett Collection was a project supported by The Women’s Library, which ran between 1990 and 1992, collecting.  Rebecca Abrams’ book, Woman in a Man's World (Methuen, 1993, {{ISBN|0-413-66350-7}}) was based on this collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsfaw/fawcett.html The Fawcett Collection project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneers in Charity and Social Welfare (2004 – present) was initiated with funding from the J. Paul Getty Jnr Charitable Trust,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpgettytrust.org.uk/ J Paul Getty Jnr Charitable Trust website]&lt;/ref&gt; and comprises interviews with key (and often unsung) individuals connected to social welfare, social policy and charity work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlscharity/charity.html Pioneers in Charity and Social Welfare project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''A National Cross-Section'''&lt;br /&gt;
The attempt to record a ‘national cross-section’ of life stories of ordinary men and women has been approached in a number of different ways.  The first was through a life story competition.  In 1991 NLS received a pilot grant from the Literature section of the Arts Council of England to develop the National Life Story Awards as an independent written and audio autobiographical competition; additional funding was received from the European Community Year of Older People and [[ITV Telethon]].  The project was especially well-publicised on both radio and television, and the ambitious official launch included [[Lord Soper]], [[Baroness Blackstone]] and [[Glenda Jackson]].   There were nearly 950 entries, of which 710 were written and 217 recorded (fifteen in video); twenty entries reached the final shortlist all of which highlighted a striking range of social background.  The judges for the final round were Asa Briggs, [[Penelope Lively]], Ann Paul, Rob Perks and [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)]], and the awards ceremony at the Barbican in September 1994 was compared by [[Melvyn Bragg]], one of NLS’s long-standing Advisors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsgen/general.html  National Life Story Awards webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A second initiative for a national ‘memory bank’ was first discussed in 1996 and an application was made to the [[Millennium Commission]].  Eventually a joint scheme (1998 – 2000), with the British Library leading with NLS as a partner along with the BBC, resulted in The Century Speaks: Millennium Oral History Project, archived at the British Library as The Millennium Memory Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohcoll/ohmaj/majorprojects.html The Millennium Memory Bank project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''political midlife crisis''' is a turning point or watershed moment in the fortunes of a governance entity such as an empire, nation, faction, political party, or international alliance. The concept was first advanced by Arab thinker [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406), who compared an individual's decline after reaching the age of forty, with the sedentary decline that occurs in a dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, political scientist [[Joshua S Goldstein]] has used the concept in his 1988 book, ''Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age''.

A political midlife crisis occurs following a prolonged [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of optimism, economic progress, conquest, or other success, and typically features attacks on, or threats toward, a rival power. The attacks are vigorously opposed, ending in stalemate or defeat.

The term "political midlife crisis" adverts to the concept of "[[midlife crisis]]", which describes a supposed crisis in a middle-aged person's identity and self-confidence, caused by events that highlight the person's aging, mortality, and any perceived deficiencies in life attainments.  The concept of political midlife crisis applies the concept of midlife crisis to the concepts of "[[social organism]]" and "[[body politic]]", which view an entire human [[society]] as a kind of single super-organism.

==History of the concept==
[[Ibn Khaldun]], in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), set out a general theory of the rise and fall of regimes.  A ruthless conqueror with a 
"[[desert]] attitude" establishes a new dynasty.  Over some years, royal authority and ''asabiyyah'' ([[social cohesion]]) enable "expansion to the limit". Then, as in the life of an individual, a turning point is reached.  According to Ibn Khaldun, when a man reaches forty he naturally stops growing, then begins to decline.  The same is the case with a sedentary civilization's culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dynasty's new sedentary culture fosters a love of luxury and pomp.  The people become over-taxed and acquire a "habit of subservience".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their rulers subvert property rights and become weak, dishonest, and divided.  Finally, after three generations—equivalent to a human lifespan—the dynasty becomes "senile and coercive".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, pp. 245, 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  There may follow a final "brightly burning show of power",&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; but collapse of the dynasty is inevitable.  A new dynasty takes over, and the cycle continues.  Ibn Khaldun says:  "This senility is a chronic disease that cannot be cured, because it is something natural."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 [[Joshua S Goldstein]] advanced the concept of the political midlife crisis in his book on "[[Long Cycle Theory|long cycle theory]]", ''Long Cycles:  Prosperity and War in the Modern Age'',&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;{{citation |first=Joshua |last= Goldstein |authorlink=Joshua S Goldstein |title=Long Cycles:  Prosperity and War in the Modern Age |url=http://www.joshuagoldstein.com/jgcycle.htm |publisher= Yale University Press |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=October 2017}} which offers four examples of the process:

*The [[British Empire]] and the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856): A century after Britain's successful launch of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and following the subsequent British railway boom of 1815–1853, Britain, in the [[Crimean War]], attacked the [[Russian Empire]], which was perceived as a threat to [[Company rule in India|British India]] and to eastern Mediterranean trade routes to India. The Crimean War highlighted the poor state of the [[British Army]], and Britain took no further part in European wars until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.
*The [[German Empire]] (Second Reich) and [[World War I]] (1914–1918): Under Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], Germany had been unified between 1864 and 1871, and then had seen 40 years' rapid industrial, military, and colonial expansion. In 1914 the [[Schlieffen Plan]] for conquering [[French Third Republic|France]] in eight weeks was to have been followed by the subjugation of the [[Russian Empire]], leaving Germany the master of ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' ([[Central Europe]]).  In the event, France, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], Russia, and the [[United States]] fought Germany to a standstill, to defeat, and to a humiliating peace settlement at [[Versailles Treaty|Versailles]] (1919) and the establishment of Germany's unstable [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33), in a prelude to [[World War II]].
*The [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962): The Soviet Union had industrialised rapidly under [[Joseph Stalin]] and, following World War II, had become a rival nuclear [[superpower]] to the [[United States]]. In 1962 Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], intent on securing strategic parity with the United States, covertly, with the support of [[Fidel Castro]], shipped nuclear missiles to Castro's [[Cuba under Fidel Castro|Cuba]], 70 miles from the US state of [[Florida]]. US President [[John F.

*The [[United States]] and the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975): During World War II and the ensuing postwar period, the United States had greatly expanded its military capacities and [[military-industrial complex|industries]]. After France, supported financially by the US, had been defeated in Vietnam in 1954 and that country had been temporarily split into [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]] under the 1954 [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Accords]]; and when war had broken out between the North and South following South Vietnam President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]'s refusal to permit all-Vietnam elections in 1956 as stipulated in the Geneva Accords, the ideologically [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] United States supported South Vietnam with materiel in a [[Cold War]] [[proxy war]] and by degrees allowed itself to be drawn into South Vietnam's losing struggle against communist North Vietnam and the [[Viet Cong]] acting in South Vietnam. Ultimately, following the defeat of South Vietnam and the United States, the US's governing belief that South Vietnam's defeat would result in all of remaining [[Indochina]] "going communist" (as proclaimed by the US's "[[domino theory]]"), proved erroneous.&lt;ref name=goldstein/&gt;{{pn|date=October 2017}}

Following [[Al Qaeda]]'s [[September 11 attacks| attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001]], and the United States' subsequent inconclusive wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan (2001–present)]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq (2003–2011)]], initiated by US President [[George W. Bush]], Professor [[Gary Weaver]] and his co-author [[Adam Mendelson]], writing in 2008, cited a survey of 109 historians, 99% of whom rated Bush a "failure" as president, two-thirds rating him the "worst ever". Weaver and Mendelson wrote that the United States had been in its "childhood" before 1898; in its "adolescence", 1898–1945; in "young adulthood", 1945–1991; in "adulthood", 1991–2001. Weaver and Mendelson, from their 2008 perspective, anticipated that the traumas of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush presidency]] would "season [the Unitied States] with new strength, wisdom and maturity", enabling it to move forward from this political midlife crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Weaver and [[Adam Mendelson]], ''America's Midlife Crisis'', Intercultural Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=December 2017}}

The '''Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg''' ({{lang-de|Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg}}) or '''SPSG''', was founded by a treaty of 23 August 1994 between the German federal states of [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]] as a public [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]] following [[German reunification]]. The treaty came into force on 1 January 1995.
The foundation is separate from the considerably larger [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] (''Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz'').

== History ==

The SPSG is an amalgamation of the Potsdam-Sanssouci State Palaces and Gardens (''Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten Potsdam-Sanssouci'') in the former [[East Germany]] and the State Palaces and Gardens Administration (''Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten'') in [[West Berlin]] that had been formed following the [[division of Germany]]. These institutions were formed from the Prussian State Palaces and Gardens Administration that had been founded on 1 April 1927 as a result of the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and the [[Prussia]]n state and which was disbanded in 1945.

The SPSG has its headquarters in Brandenburg's capital city, [[Potsdam]]. Its owners are the states of Berlin (21.35%) and Brandenburg (36.60%) and the federal government (42.05%) (as at: 2007). The foundation receives other support from numerous societies and private sponsors.

The Berlin-Brandenburg Foundation For Prussian Palaces and Gardens was listed in 2001 in the "Blue Book" that publishes a list of heritage sites in eastern Germany that are of national significance and currently includes 20 so-called "cultural beacons" (''kulturelle Leuchttürme''). The selection of heritage sites was based on an initiative of the commissaries of the Federal Office of Heritage and the Media and voted on by the East German ministers of culture.

== Properties of SPSG ==
The Foundation manages and administers approximately 500 employees in Potsdam, Brandenburg and Berlin, about 300 buildings or structures, including more than 150 historic buildings and nearly 800 acres of gardens, with Potsdam-Berlin's cultural landscape forming the largest part. With the treaty of SPSG coming into force, these land and buildings are included in the inventory:

=== In Brandenburg ===

&lt;!--

== Goals ==
In über dreihundertjähriger Bautätigkeit entstanden durch die brandenburg-preußischen Herrscher Schlösser und Gartenanlagen von internationaler Anerkennung. 1990 wurden die Schlösser und Gärten in Potsdam, die auf Berliner Gebiet liegende Pfaueninsel sowie Schloss und Park Glienicke als Weltkulturerbe unter den Schutz der [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] gestellt.

Um die kulturhistorisch bedeutenden Anlagen und Gebäude zu erhalten, ist die SPSG nach dem Gesetz zum Staatsvertrag, Artikel 2 (1), verpflichtet:
:''„…, die ihr übergebenen Kulturgüter zu bewahren, unter Berücksichtigung historischer, kunst- und gartenhistorischer und denkmalpflegerischer Belange zu pflegen, ihr Inventar zu ergänzen, der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen und die Auswertung dieses Kulturbesitzes für die Interessen der Allgemeinheit insbesondere in Wissenschaft und Bildung zu ermöglichen.“''

Neben der denkmalpflegerischen Aufgabe und der Öffnung der Schlossanlagen für Besichtigungen werden jährlich Sonderveranstaltungen und Sonderausstellungen, vor allem zu Themen der preußischen Kulturgeschichte, durchgeführt. Konzerte, wie die „Schlössernacht“ in Potsdam-Sanssouci oder das „Kammeroperfestival“ in Rheinsberg, gehören seit Jahren zu den feststehenden, gut besuchten Veranstaltungen in den Schlossanlagen.

== Die Vermögensauseinandersetzung ==

Nach dem [[Erster Weltkrieg|Ersten Weltkrieg]] und dem Ende der Monarchie wurde im November 1918 das Vermögen, der Grundbesitz und die Immobilien des Hauses Hohenzollern von der neuen Regierung beschlagnahmt. Nach achtjähriger Verhandlung zwischen dem ehemaligen Königshaus und dem preußischen Staat mit dem Ziel eines [[Vergleich (Recht)|Vergleichs]] wurde am 26. Oktober 1926 ein „Gesetz über die Vermögensauseinandersetzung zwischen dem Preußischen Staat und den Mitgliedern des vormals regierenden Preußischen Königshauses“ verabschiedet.

Dem voraus ging ein von [[Sozialdemokratie|sozialdemokratischen]] und [[Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands|kommunistischen]] Parteien angestrebter [[Volksentscheid]] mit dem Ziel der entschädigungslosen [[Enteignung]] aller zweiundzwanzig Fürstenhäuser des [[Deutsches Reich|Deutschen Reichs]]. Die am 20. Juni 1926 durchgeführte Abstimmung, die erste in der [[Weimarer Republik]], brachte 14,5 Millionen Wahlstimmen, die einem „Gesetz zur Enteignung des Fürstenvermögens“ zusagten. Eine für die Durchführung erforderliche Stimmenzahl von mindestens 20 Millionen wurde jedoch nicht erreicht. (''siehe'': [[Fürstenenteignung]])

In Folge weiterer Zugeständnisse von Seiten des Hauses Hohenzollern konnte im Oktober 1926 ein Vertrag zwischen dem ehemaligen Königshaus und der preußischen Regierung ratifiziert werden. Der als Eigentum verbliebene Immobilien- und Grundbesitz, der hauptsächlich im Osten des ehemaligen Deutschen Reichs lag, ging jedoch durch Zerstörung und Enteignung während und nach dem [[Zweiter Weltkrieg|Zweiten Weltkrieg]] verloren. Nur ein Bruchteil des durch den Vertrag zugesprochenen Besitzes blieb erhalten. Heute ist nur noch die [[Burg Hohenzollern]] bei [[Hechingen]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]]) Eigentum des Hauses Hohenzollern.

Zur Verwaltung und Instandhaltung der in Staatsbesitz gekommenen Gebäude und Gartenanlagen wurde am 1. April 1927 die preußische „Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten“ gegründet, die die Schlossanlagen als Museen der Öffentlichkeit zugänglich machten. Auch hier gab es durch Kriegseinwirkung, Gebietsverlust und Beutenahme von Kulturgut durch die [[Rote Armee|Sowjetarmee]] erhebliche Verluste. Obwohl 1955 und 1957/58 Kunstschätze aus der [[Sowjetunion]] nach Deutschland zurückkamen, fehlen in den Schlössern der SPSG bis heute mehr als 3.000 Ölgemälde, circa 1.000 Skulpturen, Tausende von Porzellanen, Möbel, 80.000 Bände aus den königlichen Bibliotheken und mehrere tausend Grafiken.

== Bildrechte ==

Im Jahre 2010 gewann die Stiftung einen Rechtsstreit um die Verwertung von Fotografien ihrer Liegenschaften vor dem Bundesgerichtshof.&lt;ref&gt;V ZR 44/10&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13364">'''Psychobiography''' aims to understand historically significant individuals, such as [[artist]]s or [[political leader]]s, through the application of [[psychological theory]] and research.

Through its merging of [[personality psychology]] and historical evidence,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality'' (2009) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; psychobiography may be considered a historical form of therapeutic [[case study]]: it represents a growing field in the realm of [[biography]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Rollyson, ''Biography'' (2007)   p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; '''Psychopathography''' is sometimes used as a term to indicate that the person being analyzed was not mentally healthy, "path" coming from ''pathos'' (πάθος)—Ancient Greek for suffering or illness. 

==Background==

Psychobiography is a field within the realms of [[psychology]] and [[biography]] that analyzes the lives of historically significant individuals through psychological theory and research. Its goal is to develop a better understanding of notable individuals by [[applied psychology|applying psychological]] theories to their biographies to further explain the motives behind some of the subjects actions and decisions. Popular subjects of psychobiographies include figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Saddam Hussein]]. A typical biography is often very descriptive, and tries to record every notable event that happened in a person's lifetime, whereas a psychobiography primarily focuses on some particular events, and tries to better understand why they happened. This field's potential has not only aided in developing a better understanding to many notable biographies throughout history, but has also inspired direction and insight into the field of psychology.

One of the first great examples of this field's utility was Dr. [[Henry Murray]]'s report on the analysis of Adolf Hitler's personality during the end of [[World War II]]. Forced to psychoanalyze from a distance, Dr. Murray used multiple sources, including Hitler's genealogy, Hitler's own writings, and biographies of Hitler, so that the Allied forces could understand his personality to better predict his behavior. By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, Dr. Murray presumed Hitler's personality as "counteractive narcism", and was able to correctly predict the German leader's suicide in the face of his country's defeat. This work by Dr. Murray not only helped establish personality psychology as a behavioral science, but it also showed how the field of psychobiography could be applied as a means of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Henry. "The Analysis of The Personality of Adolph Hitler." The Analysis of The personality of Adolph Hitler (1943). N.p., n.d. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s analysis of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (titled ''[[Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood]]'') is generally considered the first "modern" psychobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons who have been the subject of psychobiographical research include Freud, [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Robert G.L. ''[[The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler]].'' New York: First DaCapo Press Edition, (1993) (orig. pub. 1977). {{ISBN|0-306-80514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;G, R, Elton, ''The Practice of History'' (1969) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger.  ''Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography'' Granta Books, London, (2002); Vienna, (2000); New York (2002) {{ISBN|0-393-05008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Barzun/H. F. Graff, ''The Modern Researcher'' (1977) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Major psychobiographical authors include [[Erik Erikson]],&lt;ref&gt;Carducci, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; [[James William Anderson]], [[Henry Murray]], [[George Atwood]], and [[William Runyan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Many psychobiographies are [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] or [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] in orientation, but other commonly used theories include narrative models of identity such as the life story model, [[script theory]], [[Object relations theory|object relations]], and [[existentialism]]/[[Existential phenomenology|phenomenology]]; and psychobiographers are increasingly looking for explanatory complexity through an eclectic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Elms, ''Uncovering Lives'' (1997) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were other psychobiographies written before [[Freud]]'s ''Leonardo da Vinci and A Memory of His Childhood'' in 1910, it is considered the most significant contribution of its time, despite its flaws. Psychobiographies about [[William Shakespeare]] (Jones, 1910), [[Giovanni Segantini]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Richard Wagner]] (Graf, 1911), [[Amenhotep IV]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Martin Luther]] (Smith, 1913), and [[Socrates]] (Karpas, 1915) were also published between 1910 and 1915, but are not as well known.&lt;ref name="Runyan"&gt;Runyan, W., M. (1988). Progress in psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 295-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1920 and 1926, psychobiographies of [[Margaret Fuller]] (Anthony, 1920), [[Samuel Adams]] (Harlow, 1923), [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (Krutch, 1926), and [[Abraham Lincoln]] (Clark, 1923) were published by authors from a psychoanalytic perspective without a background in psychoanalysis. During the 1930s [[Tolstoy]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Molière]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[Goethe]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Nietzsche]], Poe, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Caesar]], Lincoln, [[Napoleon]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], and [[Alexander the Great]] were the subjects of psychobiographies, and soon afterward in 1943 a psychobiography of [[Adolf Hitler]], predicting his suicide, was written during World War II, but was not published until 1972. Recent, significant contributions between 1960 and 1990 include psychobiographies of [[Henry James]] (Edel, 1953–72), [[Isaac Newton]] (Manuel, 1968), [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (Erikson, 1969), [[Max Weber]] (Mitzman, 1969), [[Emily Dickinson]] (Cody, 1971), [[Joseph Stalin]] (Tucker, 1973), [[James Mill|James]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] ([[Bruce Mazlish|Mazlish]], 1975), [[T. E. Lawrence]] (Mack, 1976), Adolf Hitler (Waite, 1977), [[Beethoven]] (Solomon, 1977), [[Samuel Johnson]] (Bate, 1977), [[Alice James]] (Strouse, 1980), [[Wilhelm Reich]] (Sharaf, 1983), and [[William James]] (Feinstein, 1984).&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schultz, W., T. (2005). Handbook of psychobiography. New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychobiographies at this time were also written about groups of people, focusing on an aspect they had in common such as American presidents, philosophers, utopians, revolutionary leaders, and personality theorists. These psychobiographies are the most well known, but since 1910 there have been over 4000 psychobiographies published.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;

As psychobiography gained recognition, authors from a variety of professions contributed their own work from alternate perspectives and varying methods of analysis of the psychobiographical subjects, significantly expanding psychobiography beyond the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical perspective]]. Apart from psychoanalysts and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] who wrote the first psychobiographies, there have been historians, [[political science|political scientists]], [[personality psychology|personality psychologists]], literary critics, [[sociology|sociologists]], and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] that have contributed to the growth of the field.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;
Psychobiography has also conflicted with contemporary views of science since its origin because it contains no controlled variables or experimentation. In its early years it was dismissed as unscientific and not a legitimate addition to the field of [[psychology]] due to the push towards experimentation focused on physiological and biological factors, and away from philosophical psychology, to establish it as a natural science. The value of psychobiography to psychology is comparable to [[evolutionary psychology]], [[archeology]], and [[historical geology]], offering detailed analyses of subjects with an emphasis on contextual information, but due to the qualitative nature of this information it remains a challenge to validate psychobiographical works as empirically based applications of psychology.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

The discipline of psychobiography has developed various methodological guidelines for psychobiographical study.  Some of the most prominent are these:

# The use of prototypical scenes in the life of the subject to serve as a model of their personality pattern
# The use of a series of indicators of salience, markers such as primacy, frequency, and uniqueness of an event in a life, to identify significant patterns
# The identification of pregnant [[metaphor]]s or images that organize autobiographical narratives
# Logical coherence or consistency as a criterion for adequate psychological interpretations

Scholars untrained in the discipline who do not follow these guidelines continue to produce psychobiographical studies.

==Contributors==

===Sigmund Freud===

Freud's psychoanalytic approach (Freudian perspective) is not commonly used in its entirety in psychobiography, but it has had a lasting influence on the analysis of behavior in other areas of psychology. To sift through a lifetime of information and locate significant areas in the subject's development requires a system of identification, and psychoanalysis provided the base for this. Primacy, the initial exposure or experience, was recognized by Freud as an important factor in personality development and has remained an important aspect of personality psychology, [[psychotherapy]], and psychobiography. Frequency, repeated exposure or actions, is also important, but its significance can vary. If the frequency of an action is low then it is seen as unimportant, and if the frequency is too high it becomes passive and overlooked, also becoming less important in psychobiography. Freud's knowledge of the importance of frequency is shown in the analysis of dreams, slips, errors, and humor by recognizing that repetition leads people to disregard these behaviors or stimuli. The importance of error in psychobiography, including [[Freudian slip|slips]] and distortions, is also rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis and is used to identify hidden motives.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, I., E. (1988). Personality, psychological assessment, and psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elms===

Elms has contributed to psychobiography through many published works including psychobiographies on [[Gordon Allport|Allport]] (1972), Freud (1980), [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] (1981), and [[Henry Murray|Murray]] (1987). He has also written about the subject of psychobiography in ''Psychobiography and Case Study Methods'' and ''Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology'' defining psychobiography and its methods, and explaining the value of psychobiography in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (2007). Psychobiography and case study methods. In R. W. Robins, R. C. Fraley, &amp; R. F. Krueger (Eds.), The Handbook of Research Methods in Personality Psychology. New York: Guilford Press, pp. 97-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (1994). Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press. Paperback reprint, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Psychobiography has faced criticism from the very start,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 312-3&lt;/ref&gt; crystallised above all in the production of what Erikson caricatured as "originology"—the explaining away of significant public events and actions as the product of some minute childhood detail.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad psychobiography—using mechanical psychologising, a selective mining of the facts,&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; overdeterminism, and a tendency to pathologise&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;—is considered easy to write.  [[Anna Freud]] condemned the study of [[Woodrow Wilson]] Freud himself co-authored with [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]] on just such grounds,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 559 and 776&lt;/ref&gt; and the haphazard historical evolution of the disciple has not helped reduce its prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sacred history''' is the parts of the [[Torah]] narrative on the boundary of historicity, especially the [[Moses]] and [[The Exodus|Exodus]] stories which can be argued to have a remote historical nucleus without any positive evidence to the effect.&lt;ref&gt;
Rabbi [[Neil Gillman]], professor of Jewish philosophy at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], states
{{cquote|"I prefer to understand the [[Plagues of Egypt|plagues]] and the broader narrative of the Exodus from Egypt as redemptive or sacred history. There is a historical kernel to the story, as Tigay notes, but this kernel was elaborated and embellished by generations of [[Israelite]]s as they told and retold the story from generation to generation, first orally as a [[Folklore|folk tale]], then later in highly crafted literary documents that even later were [[Conflation|conflated]] into the biblical narrative we read today. The thrust of the entire narrative is our ancestors' conviction that Israel's Exodus from Egypt was part of God's redemptive work, the fulfillment of [[Covenant (biblical)|God's promise]] to our forefathers.

"[[Martin Buber]] puts it this way in his book titled "Moses." It may be impossible to reconstitute the course of the events themselves, he notes, but "it is nevertheless possible to recover much of the manner in which the participating people experienced those events. We become acquainted with the meeting between this people and a vast historical happening that overwhelmed it; we become conscious of the saga-creating ardor with which the people received the tremendous event and transmitted it to a moulding memory."

"Not "the events themselves," then, but "the manner in which the participating people experienced those events" is what we are reading in these [[Torah]] portions from the [[Shemot (parsha)|Book of Shemot]]. And it is this version that continues to have such an impact on us when we recite the story annually at our [[Passover Seder|Passover seders]], dipping our fingers into our wine in tribute to the suffering caused by the plagues". ''The Jewish Week'' Jan 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a wider sense, the term is used for all of the historical books of the Bible, i.e. [[Books of Kings]], [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] and [[Books of Chronicles]], spanning the period of the 10th to 5th centuries BC, and by extension also of the later books such as  [[Maccabees]] and the books of the [[New Testament]]. The term in this sense is used by [[Thomas Ellwood]] in ''Sacred history, or, the historical part of the holy scriptures of the Old and New Testaments'', published 1709.

In yet another sense, the term may refer to [[ecclesiastical history]].

'''Subjectivity''' is a central [[philosophical]] concept, related to [[consciousness]], [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[personhood]], [[reality]], and [[truth]], which has been variously defined by sources. Three common definitions include that subjectivity is the quality or condition of:
* Something being a ''[[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]'', narrowly meaning an individual who possesses conscious experiences, such as perspectives, feelings, beliefs, and desires.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon|Solomon, Robert C.]] "Subjectivity," in Honderich, Ted. ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] (Oxford University Press, 2005), p.900.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Something being a ''subject'', broadly meaning an entity that has [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], meaning that it acts upon or wields power over some other entity (an ''[[Object (philosophy)|object]]'').&lt;ref name=Allen2002&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09672550210121432 |title=Power, Subjectivity, and Agency: Between Arendt and Foucault |journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=131–49 |year=2002 |last1=Allen |first1=Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some information, idea, situation, or physical thing considered true only from the perspective of a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] or subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 |title=Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography |journal=Geoforum |volume=75 |pages=249–52 |year=2016 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These various definitions of subjectivity are sometimes joined together in philosophy. The term is most commonly used as an explanation for that which influences, informs, and biases people's judgments about truth or reality; it is the collection of the perceptions, experiences, expectations, personal or cultural understanding, and beliefs specific to a person. 

Subjectivity is contrasted to the philosophy of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], which is described as a view of truth or reality that is free of any individual's biases, interpretations, feelings, and imaginings.&lt;ref name="solomon" /&gt; 

==Philosophy==
The rise of the notion of subjectivity has its philosophical roots in the thinking of [[Descartes]] and [[Kant]], and its articulation throughout the modern era has depended on the understanding of what constitutes an individual. There have been various interpretations of such concepts as the self and the soul, and the identity or [[self-consciousness]] which lies at the root of the notion of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strazzoni |first1=Andrea |year=2015 |title=Subjectivity and individuality: Two strands in early modern philosophy: Introduction |journal=Societate si Politica |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |hdl=1765/92270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjectivity is, for instance, frequently the implicit topic of [[existentialism]], Sartre as one of its main proponents emphasizing subjectivity in his phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.ophen.org/2016/11/02/jean-paul-sartre-subjectivity-2/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre: What is Subjectivity?
 |last=Thalos |first=Mariam |date=2016 |website=http://reviews.ophen.org/ |publisher=(Article review of Sartre's 'What is Subjectivity' published byVerso Books) |access-date=11/10/18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his colleague [[Merleau-Ponty]], Sartre believed that, even within the material force of human society, the ego was an essentially transcendent being- posited, for instance, in his opus ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' through his arguments about the 'being-for-others' and the 'for-itself' (i.e., an objective and subjective human being).

==Sociology==
Subjectivity is an inherently social mode that comes about through innumerable interactions within society. As much as subjectivity is a process of [[individuation]], it is equally a process of socialization, the individual never being isolated in a self-contained environment, but endlessly engaging in interaction with the surrounding world.
Culture is a living totality of the subjectivity of any given society constantly undergoing transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, H.J. ed., 2014. Questioning foundations: truth, subjectivity and culture. Routledge.{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectivity is both shaped by it and shapes it in turn, but also by other things like the economy, political institutions, communities, as well as the natural world.

Though the boundaries of societies and their cultures are indefinable and arbitrary, the subjectivity inherent in each one is palatable and can be recognized as distinct from others. Subjectivity is in part a particular experience or organization of [[reality]], which includes how one views and interacts with humanity, objects, consciousness, and nature, so the difference between different cultures brings about an alternate experience of existence that forms life in a different manner. A common effect on an individual of this disjunction between subjectivities is [[culture shock]], where the subjectivity of the other culture is considered alien and possibly incomprehensible or even hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00330124.2012.693876 |title=Learning Wisdom Through Geographical Dislocations |journal=The Professional Geographer |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=390–5 |year=2013 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political subjectivity]] is an emerging concept in social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref name=Allen2002/&gt; Political subjectivity is a reference to the deep embeddedness of subjectivity in the socially intertwined systems of power and meaning.  "Politicality," writes [http://artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/SRahimi Sadeq Rahimi] in ''[http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/ Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity]'', "is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject ''is''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rahimi|first1=Sadeq|title=Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity: A Study of Schizophrenia and Culture in Turkey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxford &amp; New York|isbn=1138840823|page=8|url=http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/|ref=Rahimi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia''''' is a book written by [[Eric Jones (economic historian)|Eric Jones]] in 1981 to refer to the [[Great Divergence|sudden rise of Europe]] during the [[late Middle Ages]]. Ahead of the [[Caliphate|Islamic]] and [[History of China#Imperial era|Chinese]] civilizations, Europe steadily rose since the [[Early Modern period]] to a complete domination of  world trade and politics that remained unchallenged until the early 20th century.

This process started with the [[Age of discovery|first European contacts]] and subsequent [[colonization]] of great expanses of the world. The [[industrial revolution]] further reinforced it.

Jones's book gave rise to the term ''European miracle''. It is closely related to the idea of the [[Great divergence]], which rather than on the origins of the rise of Europe during the [[Renaissance]] focuses on the culmination of the process in the 18th century and the subsequent "[[British empire#The imperial century .281815.E2.80.931914.29|imperial century]]" of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].

==Argument==
Jones aims at providing an answer to the question of "Why did modern states and economies develop first in the peripheral and late-coming culture of Europe?"  Jones attempts to argue a concatenation of various factors, in particular the interplay of natural and economic factors which have worked to Europe's advantage and to the disadvantage of its Asian competitors.

The European miracle theory purports that because the European family was nuclear, women married late, and had few children, Europe's population was better controlled than the rest of the world, which "multiplied insensately" according to Jones.&lt;ref&gt;''The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia'', 2nd Edition, Cambridge UP,  p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Europe was not vulnerable to [[Malthusian Catastrophe|Malthusian Crises]] and therefore able to form a progressive, [[capitalism|capitalist]] society.

[[Urbanization]] is also adduced as a factor. Crucially, these cities were also ''semi-autonomous'', especially the [[Italian city-states]]. The growth of banking, accounting and general financial infrastructure in such cities is seen as unique and vital to the rise of Europe.

==Reception==
Jones's 1981 study is one of the most influential books dedicated to the question of [[Eurocentrism|European exceptionalism]]. Some historians, in particular of the "California school" have felt that Jones has over-stated the degree of difference between Europe and non-European regions on the eve of the Industrial Revolution.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The attention attracted by the book has also resulted in it being described by American historian [[Joel Mokyr]] as "the whipping boy of those who have resented what they viewed as historiographical triumphalism, eurocentricity, and even racism."&lt;ref name="jmokyr "&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jmokyr/Riverside.PDF | title=The Enduring Riddle of the European Miracle | accessdate=October 27, 2011 | author=Mokyr, Joel | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been attacked by thinkers such as [[James Blaut]], [[Andre Gunder Frank]], [[Kenneth Pomeranz]], and [[John M. Hobson]]. They accuse Jones of [[Eurocentrism]] and "cultural racism" (Blaut's term&lt;ref name="blaut1993p64"&gt;{{Citation | last=Blaut | first=James Morris | title=The colonizer's model of the world: geographical diffusionism and Eurocentric history | page=64 | year=1993 | publisher=The Guilford Press | place = New York, NY | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRvn-NXUQUQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20racism%22&amp;f=false| isbn=9780898623482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''The Jew of Linz''''' is a 1998 book by Australian writer Kimberley Cornish, in which the author alleges that the Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] had a profound effect on [[Adolf Hitler]] when they were both pupils at the [[Realschule]] ([[lower secondary school]]) in Linz, Austria, in the early 1900s. Cornish also alleges that Wittgenstein was involved in the [[Cambridge Five]] Soviet spy ring during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Douglas. "Hitler's pet hate," ''Jerusalem Post'', 20 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

===Summary===
#The occasion for Adolf Hitler becoming [[anti-Semitic]] was a schoolboy interaction in [[Linz]], circa 1904, with Ludwig Wittgenstein
#In the 1920s, Wittgenstein joined the ''[[Comintern]]''
#As a [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] don, and a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], Wittgenstein recruited fellow Apostles [[Guy Burgess]], [[Kim Philby]] and [[Anthony Blunt]], all students at Trinity&amp;mdash;as well as [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] from nearby [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]]&amp;mdash;to work for the [[Soviet Union]].
#Wittgenstein was responsible for the secret of decrypting the German "[[Enigma machine|Enigma]]" code being passed to [[Joseph Stalin]], which resulted ultimately in the Nazi defeats on the Eastern Front and liberation of the surviving Jews from the camps.
#Both Hitler's oratory and Wittgenstein's philosophy of language derive from the [[hermetic tradition]], the key to which is Wittgenstein's "no-ownership" theory of mind, described by [[P. F. Strawson]] in his book ''Individuals'' (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, Peter. ''Individuals''. Methuen, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realschule===
Cornish used a school photograph from the ''[[Realschule]]'' ([[lower secondary school]]) in Linz, Austria, on his book cover. That boy in the top-right corner is undisputedly Hitler (see above right). Cornish alleges that Wittgenstein is the boy on the bottom left; he says the [[Victoria Police]] photographic evidence unit in Australia examined the photograph and confirmed that it was "highly probable" the boy is Wittgenstein.

&lt;/ref&gt;
date the photograph to 1901, slightly after Hitler's arrival at the school, but two years prior to Wittgenstein's enrollment. 

Wittgenstein and Hitler both attended the Linz ''Realschule'', a state school of about 300 students, and were there at the same time only from 1903 to 1904, according to Wittgenstein's biographers.&lt;ref&gt;McGuinness, Brian. ''Young Ludwig: Wittgenstein's Life 1889-1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 51, and Monk, Ray. ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius''. Penguin, 2001 (first published 1990), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; While Hitler was just six days older than Wittgenstein, they were two grades apart at the school&amp;mdash;Hitler was repeating a year and Wittgenstein had been advanced a year. Cornish's thesis is not only that Hitler knew the young Wittgenstein, but that he hated him, and that Wittgenstein was specifically the one Jewish boy from his school days referred to in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. The last claim referred to the following quote:

{{Quote|text= Likewise at school I found no occasion which could have led me to change this inherited picture. At the Realschule, to be sure, I did meet one Jewish boy who was treated by all of us with caution, but only because various experiences had led us to doubt his discretion and we did not particularly trust him; but neither I nor the others had any thoughts on the matter.|author=Adolf Hitler|source=''Mein Kampf'', 1943 English translation by Ralph Manheim}}

Cornish argues further that Hitler's anti-Semitism involved a projection of the young Wittgenstein's traits onto the whole Jewish people. It should be noted that Wittgenstein did have three Jewish grandparents but Wittgenstein himself, and his mother and father, were Roman Catholics.

===The Cambridge Five===
Cornish also argues that Wittgenstein is the most likely suspect as recruiter of the "[[Cambridge Five]]" spy ring.  The author suggests that Wittgenstein was responsible for British [[decryption]] technology for the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] code reaching the [[Red Army]] and that he thereby enabled the Red Army victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] that liberated the camps and ultimately overthrew the Reich.

He writes that the Soviet government offered Wittgenstein the chair in philosophy at what had been Lenin's university ([[Kazan University|Kazan]]) at a time (during the [[Great Purge]]) when ideological conformity was at a premium amongst Soviet academics and enforced by the very harshest penalties. Wittgenstein wanted to emigrate to Russia, first in the twenties, as he wrote in a letter to [[Paul Engelmann]], and again in the thirties, either to work as a labourer or as a philosophy lecturer. Cornish argues that given the nature of the Soviet regime, the possibility that a non-Marxist philosopher (or even one over whom the government could exert no ideological control) would be offered such a post, is unlikely in the extreme.

===No-ownership theory of mind===
Other sections of the book deal with Cornish's theories about what he claims are the common roots of Wittgenstein's and Hitler's philosophies in mysticism, magic, and the "no-ownership" theory of mind. Cornish sees this as Wittgenstein's generalisation of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s account of the Unity of the Will, in which despite appearances, there is only a single Will acting through the bodies of all creatures. This doctrine, generalized to other mental faculties such as thinking, is presented in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s "Essays". The doctrine, writes Cornish, was also held by the Oxford philosopher [[R. G. Collingwood]] who was one of Wittgenstein's electors to his Cambridge chair. Cornish tries to tie this to Wittgenstein's arguments against the idea of "mental privacy" and in conclusion says "I have attempted to locate the source of the [[Holocaust]] in a perversion of early Aryan religious doctrines about the ultimate nature of man". Cornish also suggests that Hitler's oratorical powers in addressing the group mind of crowds and Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and denial of mental privacy, are the practical and theoretical consequences of this doctrine.

==Reception==
The  book proved controversial, with reviewers criticizing it for drawing unwarranted connections between disparate events. The main criticisms were that:

# Cornish's evidence is contentious.
# Hitler and Wittgenstein did attend the same school at the same time, but there is little evidence that they knew each other.
# There is no evidence that there was a personal antagonism between them, or that Hitler's dislike of Wittgenstein shaped the course of Nazi anti-Semitism.
# Despite the wealth of material which has emerged from the archives of the [[KGB]] since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], there is no evidence that Wittgenstein was amongst the higher-level Soviet spies in the UK, or that he was a Soviet agent, or that he had pro-Soviet sympathies at all. 
# Cornish misrepresents Wittgenstein's thought and his philosophical context, or simply does not understand him.

One of the main issues of contention is the claim that Wittgenstein triggered or substantially contributed to Hitler's antisemitism while they were at school together. It is a view that has some support. British professor Laurence Goldstein, in his ''Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and His Relevance to Modern Thought'' (1999), called Cornish's book important, writing: "For one thing, at the K.u.k. Realschule in Linz, Wittgenstein met Hitler and may have inspired in him a hatred of Jews which led, ultimately, to the Holocaust. This, naturally enough, weighed heavily on Wittgenstein's conscience in his later years ... It is overwhelmingly probable that Hitler and Wittgenstein did meet, and with dire consequences for the history of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Laurence. ''Clear and Queer Thinking: Wittgenstein's Development and His Relevance to Modern Thought''. Duckworth, 1999, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing Goldstein's own book, Mary McGinn called it a sloppy and irresponsible argument: " [O]ne is amazed at the sheer looseness of thought that allows him to assert that 'at certain points in ''Mein Kampf'' where Hitler seems to be raging against Jews in general it is the individual young Ludwig Wittgenstein whom he has in mind', and to suggest that Wittgenstein 'may have inspired … (the) hatred of Jews which led, ultimately, to the Holocaust'. It is exactly this sort of sloppy, irresponsible, 'plausible' style of thought that Wittgenstein's philosophy, by its careful attention to the particular and to not saying more or less than is warranted, is directed against."&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Mary. "Hi Ludwig!" ''Times Literary Supplement'', 26 May 2000, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selected reviews===
[[Ray Monk]], one of Wittgenstein's biographers, concentrates on the inconsistencies in Cornish's theory that Wittgenstein was the head of the Cambridge spy ring, asking why Cornish has apparently not bothered to verify any of his theories by checking the [[KGB]] archives.  Ultimately, Monk says "As I read ''The Jew of Linz'', I found myself wondering how on earth Cornish had confected so strange a piece of work. I found it by turns puzzling, funny, challenging and outrageously nutty... Cornish calls his book 'pioneer detective work', but I think it is really pioneer detective fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Monk, Ray. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-21172488.html "The Jew of Linz: Wittgenstein, Hitler and Their Secret Battle for the Mind"], ''Quadrant'', Sept 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Johnson (journalist)|Daniel Johnson]] viewed ''The Jew of Linz'' as a "revisionist tract masquerading as psycho-history". He wrote, "Cornish correctly identifies 'the twist of the investigation' as the thesis that 'Nazi [[metaphysics]], as discernible in Hitler's writings... is nothing but Wittgenstein's theory of the mind modified so as to exclude the race of its inventor'. So the ''Jew of Linz'' was indirectly responsible, at least in part, for the Holocaust. Cornish tries to deflect the implications of his argument thus: 'Whatever 'the Jews' may have done, nothing humanly justifies what was done to them.' But he then offers 'a thought that might occur to a [[Hassidic]] Jew, and that is more fittingly a matter for Jewish, as opposed to gentile, reflection: the very engine that drove Hitler's acquisition of the magical powers that made his ascent and the Holocaust possible was the Wittgenstein [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] violation'. At this point, the nonsensical shades into the downright sinister.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Daniel. "What didn't happen in Linz," ''The Sunday Times Literary Supplement'', 17 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicci French|Sean French]] wrote in the ''New Statesman'': "There is something heroic about this argument and it would be a good subject for a novel about the dangers of creating theories out of nothing. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] should have written it. It is not just that there are weak links in the theory. There are no links in the theory. No evidence that Hitler, in his final unhappy year, even knew a boy two years above him. If they did know each other, there is no evidence that he was the boy Hitler distrusted, no evidence that Hitler's remarks on snitching related to specific incidents at the Linz Realschule, no evidence that Wittgenstein informed on his fellow pupils."&lt;ref&gt;French, Sean. ''New Statesman'', 3 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same journal, [[Roz Kaveney]] calls it "a stupid and dishonest book", and says "[Cornish's] intention is to claim Wittgenstein for his own brand of contemplative mysticism, which he defines as the great insight that IndoEuropeans (or, as he unregenerately terms them, Aryans) brought to Hinduism and Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;Kaveney, Roz. ''New Statesman'', 5 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antony Flew]] offers a mixed review: "Mr Cornish contends that the reason why the government of the USSR treated Wittgenstein with such peculiar generosity was that he had been the recruiter of all the Cambridge spies. The question whether or not this hypothesis is true or false can be definitively settled only if and when the relevant Soviet archives are examined. But I am myself as confident as without such knock-down decisive verification it is possible to be that Mr Cornish is right. On the other hand, 'On the very first page of Part III, Mr Cornish explains that the essence of this doctrine was expressed by Emerson in his restatement of the original Aryan doctrine of consciousness: '… the act of seeing and the thing seen, the see-er and the spectacle, the subject and the object is one'. I confess, not very shamefacedly, that confronted with such doctrines I want to quote Groucho Marx: 'It appears absurd. But don't be misled. It is absurd.'"&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Anthony. "The Jew of Linz: Wittgenstein, Hitler and their Secret Battle for the Mind," ''Free Life'', Issue 32, July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian ''Michael Rissmann'' argues that Cornish overestimates Hitler's intellectual capacities and uses fraudulent talks [[Hermann Rauschning]] claims to have had with Hitler to prove Hitler's alleged occultist interest."&lt;ref&gt;Rissmann, Michael. ''Hitlers Gott. Vorsehungsglaube und Sendungsbewußtsein des deutschen Diktators'', Zürich München: Pendo, 2001, p. 95 and footnote 456.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Philosophy Now'', John Mann argues that the contentions that so riled up the book's many critics were simply a clever ruse by Cornish designed to attract more readers. Mann writes: "Cornish is clever enough to know if he wrote a book on his 'no ownership' theory of language it would not have a wide readership. If he says this 'no ownership' theory was taught by Wittgenstein, learned and twisted for his own ends by Hitler, and actually needs Cornish to explain it all in great detail for the rest of the book he has the book reviewed in every paper and even serialised in the Sunday Times. ... If you’re looking for a book which offers history, politics, magic and philosophy, try ''The Jew of Linz''."&lt;ref&gt;Mann, John. "The Jew of Linz by Kimberley Cornish," ''Philosophy Now'', 19 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some are So Rich and Some So Poor''''' ({{ISBN|0-393-04017-8}}), published in 1998 (with an epilogue added to the 1999 paperback edition), is a book by the late [[David Landes]], formerly Emeritus Professor of Economics and former Coolidge Professor of History at [[Harvard University]]. In it, Landes elucidates the reasons why some countries and regions of the world experienced near miraculous periods of explosive growth while the rest of the world stagnated. He does this by comparing the long-term [[economic histories]] of different regions of the world, giving priority to Europe and the United States, as well as [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[Arab world]], and [[Latin America]]. In addition to analyzing economic and [[cliometric]] figures, he gives substantial credit to such intangible assets as culture and enterprise in the different societies he examines in order to explain economic success or failure.

In doing so, he revives, at least in part, several theories he believes have been incorrectly discarded by academics over the last 40 years:

* The 'cultural thesis' or [[Protestant work ethic]] of [[Max Weber]], whereby the values imposed by the [[Protestant]] religion on its adherents would have pushed them to value hard work, timeliness, enterprise, free market and free-thinking to a much greater extent than for their Catholic brethren, which would explain the great success of northern Protestant regions such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Great Britain]], [[Denmark]] and parts of [[Germany]] as compared to southern Catholic nations such as [[Spain]] and [[France]].
* The [[Hydraulic empire|'hydraulic thesis']] or 'Oriental Despotism thesis' of [[Karl A. Wittfogel]], in which despots would control the use of water in order to submit the population to its will.
* The 'climate thesis' that posits that [[tropical climes]] are, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', poor candidates for development.
* Many of the theories of [[Adam Smith]], whose ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' is borrowed from for the title. That does not necessarily mean a doctrinaire [[neoclassical economics|neoclassicism]], as Landes notes that 'comparative advantage' can change over time.

He also spends a good deal of effort to debunk claims that the [[Asian miracle]] did not happen, was not significant, or was financed by [[European colonialism]], and he draws a correlation between the economic level of a country and the way it treats its women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11831.html] https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11831.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, he argues that the vast economic growth of the [[Industrial Revolution]] was no accident but instead resulted from several qualities of Europe, including its climate, political competition, economic freedom and attitude towards science and religion, more specifically from certain countries in Western Europe, primarily England.

==Criticism and response==
Critics have charged Landes with [[eurocentrism]] in his analysis, a charge which Landes himself does not deny; in fact, he embraces it explicitly, arguing that an explanation for an economic miracle that happened originally only in Europe (though he deals with the later '[[Asian miracle]]' in ''Wealth and Poverty'') must of necessity be a Eurocentric analysis, thus siding at least at some level with thinkers such as [[Bernard Lewis]]. Following Daniel Bell, knowledge is the necessary link between 'The European miracle' and the American [[post-industrial society]].

Landes and Professor [[Andre Gunder Frank]], author of ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age'' ({{ISBN|0520214749}}), are noted for having come to very different conclusions about the long-vie significance of economic developments in "the West" during the modern era and publicly debated their findings in 1998 at Northwestern University.

Additionally, an alternate theory relies on literacy and the gap between Protestants and Catholics as an explanation for the difference in economic results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Becker|first1=Sascha O.|last2=Wößmann|first2=Ludger|year=2007|title=Was Weber Wrong?

The economist Paul Krugman remarked in The Trouble with History (article published on his MIT-hosted blog) that the book, while containing an enormous amount of information, offered very few ideas. « What (does) ... Landes actually believe? And the answer, which seems to me to be damning, is that I am not sure. (...) So I am still waiting for a book that helps me understand what really happened in this utterly perplexing century... Whoever writes that book will have to be a person unafraid of offering theories as well as facts, and therefore of saying things that might turn out to be wrong. »

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">In [[anthropology]] and [[archaeology]], the '''Urban Revolution''' is the process by which small, kin-based, nonliterate [[agricultural]] [[village]]s were transformed into large, socially complex, urban societies. 
&lt;!-- Origins, Etymology --&gt;
The term "urban revolution" was introduced in the 1930s by [[V. Gordon Childe]], an Australian archaeologist. Childe also coined the term [[Neolithic Revolution]] to describe the earlier process by which [[hunter-gatherer]] societies domesticated crops and animals and began a farming lifestyle. Childe was the first to synthesize and organize the large volume of new archaeological data in the early 20th century in social terms. Whereas previous archaeologists had concentrated on chronology and technology, Childe applied concepts and theories from the social sciences to interpret archaeological finds.
Childe first discussed the Urban Revolution in his 1936 book, ''Man Makes Himself'',&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V. Gordon  (1936)  Man Makes Himself. Watts and Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt; and then his 1950 article in the journal ''Town Planning Review''&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V. Gordon  (1950)  The Urban Revolution. Town Planning Review 21:3-17.&lt;/ref&gt; brought the concept to a much larger audience. In that paper, he presented a 10-point model for the changes that characterized the Urban Revolution:

# In point of size the first cities must have been more extensive and more densely populated than any previous settlements.
# In composition and function the urban population already differed from that of any village … full-time specialist craftsmen, transport workers, merchants, officials and priests.
# Each primary producer paid over the tiny surplus he could wring from the soil with his still very limited technical equipment as tithe or tax to an imaginary deity or a divine king who thus concentrated the surplus.
# Truly monumental public buildings not only distinguish each known city from any village but also symbolise the concentration of the social surplus.
# But naturally priests, civil and military leaders and officials absorbed a major share of the concentrated surplus and thus formed a “ruling class”.
# Writing.
# The elaboration of exact and predictive sciences – arithmetic, geometry and astronomy.
# Conceptualized and sophisticated styles 
# Regular “foreign” trade over quite long distances.
# A State organisation based now on residence rather than kinship.

Although sometimes interpreted as a model of the origins of cities and urbanism, Childe's concept in fact describes the transition from agricultural villages to state-level, urban societies. This change, which occurred independently in several parts of the world, is recognized as one of the most significant changes in human [[Sociocultural evolution]].
Although contemporary models for the origins of complex urban societies have progressed beyond Childe's original formulation,&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert McC.  (1966)  The Evolution of Urban Society: Early Mesopotamia and Prehispanic Mexico. Aldine, Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;
Johnson, Allen W. and Timothy K. Earle  (2000)  The Evolution of Human Societies: From Foraging Group to Agrarian State. 2nd ed. Stanford University Press, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; there is general agreement that he correctly identified one of the most far-reaching social transformations prior to the Industrial Revolution, as well as the major processes involved in the change.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E., “V. Gordon Childe and the Urban Revolution: An Historical Perspective on a Revolution in Urban Studies,” Town Planning Review 80 (2009) 3-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veritism''' was a socio-philosophical [[ideology]] promoted by the "Veritism Foundation" (apparently now defunct). It advocates that man has been presented with no conclusive evidence lending credence to the existence of a specific [[deity]], or supreme entity and thus has no justification for reaching any kind of conclusions on the nature of such a being other than that (as represented by humanity's current state) it is a benign force.

==Basic Propositions==

===On History===
Veritism proposes that man has been engaged in an unfruitful search for truth since his creation.
Veritism also emphasizes that some, not having found truth, or lacking direction in their own lives, have rejected the existence of [[absolute truth]], thus embracing [[atheistic]], [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] ideologies.
History is a crucial aspect in Veritism, as most of Veritistic theory rests upon the conclusion that truth must be revealed unto humanity by an external means. The past lends credence to this conclusion, as throughout human history multiple theories and ideologies have been discarded. Essentially, philosophy is a dynamic subject, constantly in a state of change: conclusions are eternally tested, challenged, and discarded, only to be quickly and efficiently replaced by those seemingly more plausible.

===On Ultimate Truth===
Veritism suggests that humanity may only theorize upon non-observable studies. Man can draw conclusions concerning solid, physical sciences such as mathematics or chemistry. But he cannot claim he has undeniably and irrefutably answered questions relative to philosophy. Thus the only logical [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] concerning [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] philosophical truth is that it simply does not exist. Yet many discard this statement, saying that it denies its own antecedent (one claims an absolute when he denies the existence of absolute truth). Yet upon examination of this particular antecedent we find that it is specific to a certain kind of truth, and thus claims only that truths asserted from a certain medium cannot be conclusive. As an example, any type of personal [[revelation]] or "vision" cannot be deemed as legitimate, as there is ultimately no way to prove that it was of divine cause or of personal accord. In Veritism the question becomes "what is the nature of truths presented?", "what is their claim?" and "is that claim plausible?"

===On Religion===
Veritism dismisses [[organized religion]] or any claim to ultimate truth as ignorant and without grounds.

===On Reality===
A veritistic view of reality is rather basic. That which can be perceived by the five senses is that which exists.

===On Ethics===
Veritistic [[ethics]] would advocate that humans have an inherent view of that which is right or wrong. This is demonstrated in law and government. The only humans lacking any type of self [[morals]] or ethical inclination are those with a mental or psychological dysfunction. Veritism consequently suggests that there are numerous cultural factors which influence behavior concerning ethics, sometimes in a negative way.
Veritistic thinking also attributes action to negative consequence. Some may subscribe to a religion simply because they fear a negative [[afterlife]]. Those who are truly moral, ethical people are those who do good with no ultimate reward, simply because it is the right thing to do.

The '''Wakker Prize''' (in German: ''Wakkerpreis'', in French ''Prix Wakker'', in Italian ''Premio Wakker'') is awarded annually by the [[Swiss Heritage Society]] to a [[Municipality of Switzerland]] for the development and preservation of its architectural heritage.

At the beginning, the prize honoured municipalities which did special needs for preservation of the old towns. Recently,{{When|date=January 2015}} the prize also honours municipalities that develop their townscapes on a specific leading point. This might be an estimated use of an old industrial facility or a successful combination between old and new basic structure of a building.

In 2005, the prize was given to the [[Swiss Federal Railways]], rather than a municipality, because of the jubilee of the Swiss Heritage Society.

The prize is named for [[Henri-Louis Wakker]].

==Criteria==
To get this prize, municipalities have to follow the named criteria:
* A visible, qualitative development and upgrading of townscape in a contemporary manner.
* To be respectful towards with old settlement pattern.
* An active input for above-average architectural quality, due to a good example of the municipality.
* The current place-planning prefers the development of the prize.
* At the end are following issues important for the overall assessment, protection of the area, sustainability, traffic planning and residential quality.

The '''William Lynch speech''' is an address purportedly delivered by a certain '''William Lynch''' (or '''Willie Lynch''') to an audience on the bank of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] in [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]] in 1712 regarding control of [[slavery|slaves]] within the colony.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite web | last= Taylor|first=Anne Cleëster| url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/library/blackstudies/narrate.htm |title=The Slave Consultant's Narrative: The life of an Urban Myth |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808080232/http://www.umsl.edu/services/library/blackstudies/narrate.htm |archivedate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter purports to be a verbatim account of a short speech given by a slave owner, in which he tells other slave masters that he has discovered the "secret" to controlling black slaves by [[divide and rule|setting them against one another]]. The document has been in print since at least 1970, but first gained widespread notice in the 1990s, when it appeared on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"&gt;Rosenzweig, p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has often been promoted as an authentic account of slavery during the 18th century, though its inaccuracies and anachronisms have led historians to conclude that it is a hoax.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch's Letter Real? |accessdate=27 December 2012 |last=Cobb |first=W. Jelani |coauthors= |date= |year=2004 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The reputed author, William Lynch, identifies himself as the master of a "modest plantation" in the [[British West Indies]] who has been summoned to the [[Virginia Colony]] by local slaveowners to advise them on problems they have been having in managing their slaves.

He briefly notes that their current violent method of handling unruly slaves – [[lynching]], though the term is not used – is inefficient and counterproductive. Instead, he suggests that they adopt his method, which consists of exploiting differences such as age and skin color in order to pit slaves against each other. This method, he assures his hosts, will "control the slaves for at least 300 hundred{{sic}} years."&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Some online versions of the text attach introductions, such as a foreword attributed to [[Frederick Douglass]], or citations falsely giving Lynch's name as the source of the word "[[wikt:lynch|lynching]]".&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt;

The text of the speech has been published since at least 1970.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt; It appeared on the internet as early as 1993, when a reference librarian at the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]] posted the document on the library's [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher server]].&lt;ref name=taylor1995&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/library/blackstudies/winbail.htm |accessdate= June 21, 2008 |last=Taylor |first=Anne Cleëster |title=Email to Samuel Winslow and Lee Bailey about researching The Narrative. |work=The Slave Consultant's Narrative: The life of an Urban Myth? |publisher=University of Missouri-St. Louis, Thomas Jefferson Library Reference Department |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808191222/www.umsl.edu/services/library/blackstudies/winbail.htm |archivedate=2007-08-08|quote=The publisher who gave me this wanted to remain anonymous on the gopher version because he couldn't trace it, either, and until now I've honored his wishes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The librarian later revealed that she had obtained the document from the publisher of a local annual business directory, ''The St. Louis Black Pages''&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070808191222/http://www.umsl.edu:80/services/library/blackstudies/winbail.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in which the narrative had recently appeared.&lt;ref name=taylor1995 /&gt; 

Though eventually convinced the document was a forgery, the librarian elected to leave it on the Gopher server, as she believed that "even as an inauthentic document, it says something about the former and current state of African America", but added a warning about its provenance.&lt;ref name=taylor1995 /&gt;

The text contains numerous anachronisms, including words and phrases such as "refueling" and "fool proof" which were not in use until the early 20th century,&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; while historian [[Roy Rosenzweig]] noted the divisions emphasized in the text – skin color, age, and gender – are distinctly 20th-century in nature, making little sense in an 18th-century context.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt;

As such, historians such as Rosenzweig and [[William Jelani Cobb]] of [[Spelman College]] regard the William Lynch speech as a hoax.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;

{{Main article|William Lynch (Lynch law)}}
Forewords attached to some online versions of the speech credit the narrator's name as the source of the terms [[lynching|"lynching" and "Lynch law"]], despite the narrator specifically advocating against lynching.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; A man named [[William Lynch (Lynch law)|William Lynch]] did indeed claim to have originated the term during the [[American Revolutionary War]], but he was born in 1742, thirty years after the alleged delivery of the speech.&lt;ref name="ANB"&gt;Brent Tarter.

The '''World Oral Literature Project''' was ''"an urgent global initiative to document and disseminate endangered oral literatures before they disappear without record"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/ World Oral Literature Project].&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Dr [[Mark Turin]] and co-located at the [[University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], at the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Yale University]], the project was established in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/about/project.html About the World Oral Literature Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 2013 the organization ceased funding projects, whilst maintaining online resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.oralliterature.org/about/project.html | title = About : The Project | accessdate = 11 Sep 2018 | quote = From March 2013 the World Oral Literature Project will no longer be offering grants. We regret that from the end of March it will not be possible to accept collections or answer emails. However, online resources and archival material will continue to be available to the public through this website.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The World Oral Literature Project provided small grants to fund the collecting of [[oral literature]], with a particular focus on the peoples of Asia and the Pacific, and on areas of cultural disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/grants/grants.html World Oral Literature Project Fieldwork Grants].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Project hosted training workshops for grant recipients and other engaged scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/research/workshops.html World Oral Literature Project Workshops].&lt;/ref&gt; The World Oral Literature Project also publishes oral texts and occasional papers, and makes collections of oral traditions accessible through online media platforms such as Cambridge Streaming Media Service and [[DSpace]].

==Activities==
===Research===
Fourteen funded oral literature fieldwork and documentation projects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/grants/grantees.html Grantees], World Oral Literature Project.&lt;/ref&gt; were completed between 2009-2013.

===Online collections===
The World Oral Literature Project collected data gathered by grantees and anthropology fieldworkers as well as historic collections. This data is primarily audio and visual files that are either born digital or are digitised by the Project. This material is archived using [[DSpace]] and, where culturally appropriate, disseminated to the public through the World Oral Literature Project websites and streaming media services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/collections/collections.html World Oral Literature Project: Collections], World Oral Literature Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occasional Paper series===

===Database===
Researchers at the World Oral Literature Project have compiled a database of language endangerment levels, including references to collections and recordings of oral literature that exist in archives around the world. Data on language endangerment are drawn from the ''online Ethnologue'', the ''UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger'', and from a 'red list' compiled by Professor William Sutherland in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref name = db&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/research/databaseterms.html Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

However the project states ''The World Oral Literature Project does not take responsibility for the accuracy of the materials that our researchers have compiled from these three sources, and the Project does not have the staffing capacity to keep these resources up to date.''.&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;
