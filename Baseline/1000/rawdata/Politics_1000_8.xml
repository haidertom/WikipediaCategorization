* "The restoration of Irish national sovereignty".
* "To seek to achieve unity among the Irish people on the issue of restoring national sovereignty and to promote the revolutionary ideals of republicanism and to this end involve itself in resisting all forms of colonialism and imperialism."
* "To seek the immediate and unconditional release of all Irish republican prisoners throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.32csm.info/const.html|title=32CSM|publisher=|access-date=20 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317214839/http://www.32csm.info/const.html|archive-date=17 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The organisation was founded as the '''32 County Sovereignty Committee'''&lt;ref name="p28" /&gt; on 7 December 1997 at a meeting of like-minded [[Irish republican]]s in [[Finglas]] in Dublin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Those present were opposed to the direction taken by [[Sinn Féin]] and other mainstream republican groups in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], which would lead to the [[Belfast Agreement]] (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) the following year. The same division in the republican movement led to the paramilitary group now known as the [[Real IRA]] breaking away from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] at around the same time.

Most of its founders had been members of Sinn Féin; some had been expelled from the party for challenging the leadership's direction, while others felt they had not been properly able to air their concerns within Sinn Féin at the direction its leadership had taken. [[Bernadette Sands McKevitt]],  wife of [[Michael McKevitt]] and a sister of [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|hunger striker]] [[Bobby Sands]], was a prominent member of the group until a split in the organisation.

The name refers to the 32 [[counties of Ireland]] which were created during the [[Lordship of Ireland|Lordship]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. With the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1920–22, twenty-six of these counties formed the [[Irish Free State]] which became the [[Republic of Ireland]]; the remaining six counties of [[Northern Ireland]] remain part of the [[United Kingdom]].

Before the referendums on the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]], the 32CSM lodged a legal submission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.32csm.info/UNsubmission.html|title=Submission to the UN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the United Nations challenging British sovereignty in Ireland. The referendums were opposed by the 32CSM, but were supported by 71% of voters in Northern Ireland and by 94% in the Republic of Ireland. In November 2005 the 32CSM launched a political initiative titled ''Irish Democracy, A Framework For Unity.''

On 24 May 2014 [[Gary Donnelly (Irish republican)|Gary Donnelly]], a member of the 32 Country Sovereignty Movement, was elected to the [[Derry]] and [[Strabane]] super council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27559217 |title=Gary Donnelly elected in Derry &amp; Strabane |publisher=BBC |date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/dissident-republican-gary-donnelly-takes-derry-and-strabane-super-council-seat-and-faces-ira-bomb-motion-30348381.html |title=Dissident republican Gary Donnelly takes Derry and Strabane super council seat and faces IRA bomb motion |publisher=The Belfast Telegraph |date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014 a delegation from the 32 County Sovereignty Movement travelled to Canada, to take part in a six-day speaking tour. On arrival the delegation was detained and refused entry into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ulsterherald.com/2014/07/28/canadian-detention-a-political-decision-francis-mackey/ |title=Canadian detention a ‘political decision’ – Francis Mackey |publisher=Ulster Herald |accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
[[File:Easter Rising Dublin Parade - 25 April 2010 -www.keepvid.com-.ogv|thumb |200px |32CSM march to commemorate [[Easter Rising]], Dublin, April 2010]]
The 32CSM has protested against what it calls "internment by remand" in both jurisdictions in Ireland.

Other protests include ones against former [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) leader [[Ian Paisley]] in [[Cobh]], County Cork, against former British Prime Minister [[John Major]] being given the Keys to [[Cork city]], against a visit to the Republic of Ireland by [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] head Sir [[Hugh Orde]], and against the Israeli [[Palestinian territories|occupation of Palestine]] and Anglo-American [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]].

In 2015 the 32CSM organised a demonstration in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] in solidarity with the men convicted of shooting Constable Stephen Carroll, the first police officer to be killed in Northern Ireland since the formation of the PSNI. The organisation says the "Craigavon Two" are innocent and have been victims of a [[miscarriage of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/video-tempers-flare-at-irish-republican-protest-in-dundee-1.804762|title=VIDEO: Tempers flare at Irish republican protest in Dundee|last=Dinnie|first=Steven|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The 32 County Sovereignty Movement has often been critical of the Real  IRA's military actions.&lt;ref&gt;After the [[Omagh bombing|Omagh bomb attack]], the organisation issued a statement saying "the killing of innocent people could not be justified," and that it was "deeply saddened and devastated" by the attack. From [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/152512.stm "Links with terror group rejected"], BBC News, 17 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; However the group is currently considered a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist organization]] (FTO) in the [[United States]], because the group is considered to be inseparable from the Real IRA, which is designated as an FTO.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm|title=Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)|website=2001-2009.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1330611/Real-IRA-designated-terrorists.html |title=Real IRA designated terrorists |publisher=The Telegraph |date=17 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a briefing in 2001 a spokesman for the [[US Department of State]] stated that "evidence provided by both the British and Irish governments and open source materials demonstrate clearly that the individuals who created the Real IRA also established these two entities to serve as the public face of the Real IRA. These alias organizations engage in propaganda and fundraising on behalf of and in collaboration with the Real IRA." The US Department of State's designation made it illegal for Americans to provide material support to the Real IRA, requires US financial institutions to block the group's assets and denies alleged RIRA members visas into the US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2001/2922.htm|title=Real IRA Designation (Taken question)|website=2001-2009.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Ireland==
The 32CSM also operates outside of the island of Ireland to some extent. The [[Michael Gaughan (Irish republican)|Gaughan]]/[[Frank Stagg (Irish republican)|Stagg]] Cumann covers England, Scotland and Wales and has an active relationship of mutual promotion with a minority of British [[hard left]] groups, including the [[Anti-Fascist Action|Anti-Fascist Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gaughanstaggcumann.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/gaughanstagg-cumann32csm-continues-to.html|publisher=Gaughan Stagg Cumann - 32CSM|title=Gaughan/Stagg Cumann(32CSM) continues to build on the unity between Antifascists and Irish Republicans|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=1542014856068531&amp;story_fbid=1544124079190942|publisher=Facebook|title=Gaughan Stagg Cumann - 32CSM |date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2012/07/497944.html?c=on|publisher=Liverpool Antifascists|title=Antifascist Solidarity Needed in Liverpool on Saturday 21st July!|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The James Larkin Republican Flute Band (founded in 1996) in [[Liverpool]] and the [[West of Scotland Band Alliance]] (founded in 1979)–the largest section of which is the [[Glasgow]]-based Parkhead Republican Flute Band–are also supporters of the 32CSM&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowe|2013|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (the larger flute band communities in these areas tend to be aligned to [[Sinn Féin]] instead). As of 2014 the 32CSM's paramilitary wing, the Real IRA, was also still involved in attempts to perpetrate bombings in Britain as part of the [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign]], which has been ongoing since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26229321 'IRA group' sent suspect packages to army offices].

==Birthplace==
According to government records, Fujimori was born on 28 July 1938, in [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]], a district of [[Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Champion|first=Margaret Y.|title=Peru and the Peruvians in the Twentieth Century: Politics and Prospects |year= 2006|publisher=Vantage Press|location=New York|page=476|isbn=0-533-15159-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Naoichi Fujimori (original surname ''Minami'', adopted by a childless relative; 1897–1971) and Mutsue Inomoto Fujimori (1913–2009), were natives of [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]], Japan, who migrated to Peru in 1934.&lt;ref name= "McClintockVallas50"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McClintock |first=Cynthia |author2=Fabián Vallas |title=The United States and Peru |year=2002 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |page=50 |isbn=0-415-93463-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=González Manrique |first= Luis Esteban|title=La encrucijada peruana: de Alan García a Fujimori|year=1993|publisher=Fundación CEDEAL|location= Madrid |page= 467|isbn=84-87258-38-7|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1997, the news magazine ''[[Caretas]]'' alleged that Fujimori had actually been born in Japan, in his father's hometown of [[Kawachi, Kumamoto|Kawachi]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="Caretas"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Valenzuela|first=Cecilia|title=Buscando La Cuna De Fujimori|url=http://www.caretas.com.pe/1475/fujimori/fujimori.htm |work=[[Caretas]]|year=1997|issue=1475|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Peru's constitution requires the president to have been born in Peru, this would have made Fujimori ineligible to be president.&lt;ref name="McClintockVallas50"/&gt; The magazine, which had been sued for libel by [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] seven years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dartnell|first=Michael York|title=Insurgency Online: Web Activism and Global Conflict|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|page=77|isbn=0-8020-8747-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Fujimori's birth and baptismal certificates might have been altered.&lt;ref name="Caretas"/&gt; ''Caretas'' also alleged that Fujimori's mother declared having two children when she entered Peru;&lt;ref name="Caretas"/&gt; Fujimori is the second of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= |first= |title=Fujimori's documents raise fresh controversy |url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19970727/20850523.html |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=27 July 1997 |accessdate=7 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108231520/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19970727/20850523.html |archivedate=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caretas''{{'}} contentions were hotly contested in the Peruvian media; the magazine ''Sí'', for instance, described the allegations as "pathetic" and "a dark page for [Peruvian] journalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Waisbord|first=Silvio Ricardo|title=Watchdog Journalism in South America|year=2000|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|page=83|isbn=0-231-11975-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American scholars [[Cynthia McClintock]] and Fabián Vallas note that the issue appeared to have died down among Peruvians after the Japanese government announced in 2000 that "Fujimori's parents had registered his birth in the Japanese consulate in Lima".&lt;ref name="McClintockVallas50"/&gt;

==Early years==
Fujimori obtained his early education at the Colegio Nuestra Señora de la Merced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Prieto Celi|first=Federico|title=Rescate en Lima|year=1997|publisher=Realidades S.A|location=Lima|isbn=|oclc=37997948|page=32|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and La Rectora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jochamowitz|first=Luis|title=Ciudadano Fujimori: la construcción de un político|year = 1994 |edition=2nd|publisher=PEISA|location=Lima|isbn=|oclc=31847656|page=87|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujimori's parents were Buddhists, but he was baptised and raised as a Roman Catholic. While he spoke mainly Japanese at home, Fujimori also learned to become a proficient Spanish speaker during his years at school.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Wilson Company (1996), p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Fujimori graduated from La gran unidad escolar Alfonso Ugarte in Lima.&lt;ref&gt;Jochamowitz, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to undergraduate studies at the [[La Molina National Agrarian University|Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina]] in 1957, graduating in 1961 first in his class as an [[Agricultural engineering|agricultural engineer]]. The following year he lectured on [[mathematics]] at the university. In 1964 he went to study [[physics]] at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in France. On a Ford scholarship, Fujimori also attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rochester.edu/undergraduate/sums/aftermath/famouspeople.html Famous people major in Mathematics], University of Rochester website. Retrieved on 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, where he obtained his master's degree in mathematics in 1969. 

In 1974, he married [[Susana Higuchi]], also Japanese-Peruvian. They had four children, including a daughter, [[Keiko Fujimori|Keiko]], and a son, [[Kenji Fujimori|Kenji]], who would later follow their father into politics. 

In recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the Universidad Nacional Agraria offered Fujimori the [[Dean (education)|deanship]] and in 1984 appointed him to the [[Rector (academia)|rector]]ship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also became president of the National Commission of Peruvian University Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores), a position which he has held twice. He also hosted a TV show called ''"Concertando"'' from 1988 to 1989, on Peru's state-owned network, [[TV Perú|Channel 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alberto-Fujimori|title=Alberto Fujimori|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|date=27 December 2017|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori won the 1990 presidential election as a [[dark horse]] candidate under the banner of  [[Cambio 90]] ("cambio" means "change") beating world-renowned writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] in a surprising upset. He capitalized on profound disenchantment with outgoing president [[Alan García]] and the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] party (APRA). He exploited popular distrust of Vargas Llosa's identification with the existing Peruvian political establishment, and uncertainty about his plans for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/154825/la-frugalidad-de-cambio-90-y-el-derroche-de-fredemo|title=La frugalidad de "Cambio 90" y el derroche de Fredemo|date=14 April 1990|publisher=El Proceso|language=es|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed ''El Chino'', which roughly translates to "[[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called ''chino'' in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always gladdened by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Fujimori, in Ellen Perry's ''The Fall of Fujimori''&lt;/ref&gt; With his election victory, he became just the second person of [[East Asia]]n descent to become [[head of government]] of a Latin American nation, after [[Fulgencio Batista]] of Cuba and the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after [[Arthur Chung]] of [[Guyana]] and [[Henk Chin A Sen]] of [[Suriname]] (each of whom had served as [[head of state]], rather than head of government).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mMY4-ffumwUC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=fujimori+%22Arthur+Chung%22+%22Henk+Chin+A+Sen+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BY2VdGPRv6&amp;sig=6t6zbibMxRX2jS8ZcFnov9Bzr0E&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmvc2EhqvYAhUI9IMKHSbLDLsQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=fujimori%20%22Arthur%20Chung%22%20%22Henk%20Chin%20A%20Sen%20%22&amp;f=false|title=The Affinity of the Eye: Writing Nikkei in Peru|author=Ignacio López-Calvo|date=2013|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First term==

===Fujishock===
During his first term in office, Fujimori enacted wide-ranging neoliberal reforms, known as Fujishock. During the presidency of [[Alan García]], the economy had entered a period of [[hyperinflation]] and the political system was in crisis due to the country's internal conflict, leaving Peru in "economic and political chaos".&lt;ref name=lp&gt;Benson, Sara and Hellander, Paul and Wlodarski, Rafael. ''[[Lonely Planet]]: Peru''. 2007, pages 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Fujimori's stated objective to pacify the nation and restore economic balance. This program bore little resemblance to his campaign platform and was in fact more drastic than anything Vargas Llosa had proposed.&lt;ref name=gouge3&gt;Gouge, Thomas. ''Exodus from Capitalism: The End of Inflation and Debt''. 2003, page 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the ''Fujishock'' succeeded in restoring Peru to the global economy, though not without immediate social cost.&lt;ref name=manz&gt;Manzetti, Luigi. ''Privatization South American Style''. 1999, page 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori's initiative relaxed [[private sector]] [[price controls]], drastically reduced government [[subsidies]] and government employment, eliminated all [[exchange controls]], and also reduced restrictions on investment, imports, and [[capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref name=manz /&gt; [[Tariff]]s were radically simplified, the [[minimum wage]] was immediately quadrupled, and the government established a $400 million poverty relief fund.&lt;ref name=manz /&gt; The latter seemed to anticipate the economic agony to come: the price of electricity quintupled, water prices rose eightfold, and gasoline [[price]]s 3,000%.&lt;ref name=gouge3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=manz /&gt;

However, many do not attribute the Fujishock to Fujimori. In the 1980s, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] created a plan for South American economies called the [[Washington Consensus]]. The document, written by [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]] in 1990, consists of ten measures that would lead to a healthy economic policy. Under pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]]  (IMF), the Peruvian government was to follow the guidelines set by the international finance community. The ten points were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/williamson0904-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

# Fiscal discipline
# Reordering of public expenditure
# Tax reform (Broadening)
# Liberalization of interest rates
# Competitive exchange rate
# Trade liberalization
# Liberalization of foreign direct investment
# Privatization
# Deregulation of barrier entry and exit, safety regulations, and governed prices
# Property rights for the informal sector

The IMF was content with Peru's measures, and guaranteed loan funding for Peru.&lt;ref name=gouge&gt;Gouge, Thomas. ''Exodus from Capitalism: The End of Inflation and Debt''. 2003, page 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation rapidly began to fall and foreign investment capital flooded in.&lt;ref name=gouge /&gt; The [[privatization]] campaign involved selling off of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, and replacing the country's troubled currency, the [[Peruvian inti|inti]], with the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|Nuevo Sol]].&lt;ref name=lp /&gt; The ''Fujishock'' restored [[macroeconomic]] stability to the economy and triggered a considerable long-term economic upturn in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Carol Stokes, Susan. ''Public Support for Market Reforms in New Democracies''. 2001, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Peruvian economy grew at a rate of 13%, faster than any other economy in the world.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt;

===Constitutional crisis===
{{Main|1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis}}

During Fujimori's first term in office, APRA and Vargas Llosa's party, the [[Democratic Front (Peru)|FREDEMO]], remained in control of both chambers of Congress, the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Senate]], hampering the enactment of economic reform. Fujimori also had difficulty combatting the [[Maoism|Maoist]] [[Shining Path]] ({{lang-es|Sendero Luminoso}}) guerrilla organization due largely to what he perceived as intransigence and obstructionism in Congress. By March 1992, Congress met with the approval of only 17% of the electorate, according to one poll; the president's approval rate stood at 42%, in the same poll.&lt;ref name=smith234&gt;Smith, Peter H. ''Latin America in Comparative Perspective: New Approaches to Methods and Analysis''. 1995, page 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis|political deadlock]], Fujimori, with the support of the military, on 5 April 1992, carried out a [[self-coup|presidential coup]].&lt;ref&gt;

He shut down Congress, suspended the constitution, and purged the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Levitsky, Steven "Fujimori and Post-Party Politics in Peru", ''Journal of Democracy''. 10(3):78&lt;/ref&gt;

The coup was welcomed by the public, according to numerous polls.&lt;ref name=smith236&gt;Smith, Peter H. ''Latin America in Comparative Perspective: New Approaches to Methods and Analysis''. 1995, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was the coup itself marked by favorable public opinion in several independent polls, but also public approval of the Fujimori administration jumped significantly in the wake of the coup.&lt;ref name=smith236 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Levitt&gt;

Fujimori's coup was immediately met with near-unanimous condemnation from the international community.&lt;ref name=smith236 /&gt; The [[Organization of American States]] denounced the coup and demanded a return to "[[representative democracy]]",&lt;ref name= smith238&gt;Smith, Peter H.

{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations between the OAS, the government, and opposition groups led Albert Fujimori initially to propose a referendum to ratify the auto-coup, but the OAS rejected this. Fujimori then proposed scheduling elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), which would draft a new constitution to be ratified by a national referendum. Despite a lack of consensus among political forces in Peru regarding this proposal, an ''ad hoc'' OAS meeting of ministers nevertheless endorsed this scenario in mid-May. Elections for the CCD were held 22 November 1992.&lt;ref name=Levitt /&gt;

Various states individually condemned the coup. [[Venezuela]] broke off diplomatic relations, and [[Argentina]] withdrew its ambassador. [[Chile]] joined [[Argentina]] in requesting Peru's suspension from the [[Organization of American States]]. International lenders delayed planned or projected loans, and the United States, Germany and Spain suspended all non-humanitarian aid to Peru. The coup appeared to threaten the reinsertion strategy for economic recovery, and complicated the process of clearing Peru's arrears with the [[International Monetary Fund]].

Peruvian–U.S. relations earlier in Fujimori's presidency had been dominated by questions of [[coca eradication]] and Fujimori's initial reluctance to sign an accord to increase his military's eradication efforts in the lowlands. Fujimori's ''autogolpe'' became a major obstacle to relations, as the United States immediately suspended all military and economic aid, with exceptions for counter-narcotic and humanitarian funds.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the self-coup, however, the [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W.

===Post-coup period===
With FREDEMO dissolved and APRA leader [[Alan García]] exiled to [[Colombia]], Fujimori sought to legitimize his position. He called elections for a [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]], to serve as a legislature and a [[constituent assembly]]. The [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] and [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action]] attempted a boycott of this election, but the Popular Christian Party (PPC, not to be confused with PCP, Partido Comunista del Peru) and many left-leaning parties participated in this election. Fujimori supporters won a majority of the seats in this body, and drafted a [[Constitution of Peru|new constitution]] in 1993. In a [[Peruvian constitutional referendum, 1993|referendum]], the coup and the Constitution of 1993 were approved by a narrow margin of less than five percent.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=pe011993 Peru, 31 October 1993: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, on 13 November, General [[Jaime Salinas]] led a failed military coup. Salinas asserted that his intentions were to turn Fujimori over to be tried for violating the Peruvian constitution.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1994, Fujimori separated from his wife [[Susana Higuchi]] in a noisy, public divorce. He formally stripped her of the title [[First Lady]] in August 1994, appointing their eldest daughter First Lady in her stead. Higuchi publicly denounced Fujimori as a "tyrant" and claimed that his administration was corrupt. They formally divorced in 1995.

In Fujimori's first term of office, over 3,000 Peruvians were killed in political murders.&lt;ref name="FTWD2" /&gt;{{context needed|Those may be refering to the terrorist killed.}}

==Second term==
The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, and in April 1995, at the height of his popularity, Fujimori easily won reelection with almost two-thirds of the vote. His major opponent, former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], won only 22 percent of the vote. Fujimori's supporters won comfortable majorities in the legislature. One of the first acts of the new congress was to declare an amnesty for all members of the [[Peruvian military]] or [[Law enforcement in Peru|police]] accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lum.cultura.pe/cdi/documento/fujimori-signs-amnesty-law-fujimori-firma-ley-de-amnist%C3%ADa|title=Fujimori signs amnesty law|publisher=Peruvian Ministry of Culture|accessdate=2017-12-27|author=National Security Archive|date=15 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his second term, Fujimori along with [[President of Ecuador|Ecuadorian President]] [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], signed a peace agreement with [[Ecuador]] over a [[History of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute|border dispute]] that had simmered for more than a century. The treaty allowed the two countries to obtain international funds for developing the border region. Fujimori also settled some issues with Chile, Peru's southern neighbor, which had been unresolved since the 1929 [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Jorge ''et al.'' (2003) ''Boundary Disputes in Latin America'' [[United States Institute of Peace]], Washington, D.C., [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?u=1&amp;num=33&amp;seq=3&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=mdp.39015052976985 page 33], {{OCLC|53067610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 election was the turning point in Fujimori's career. Peruvians began to be more concerned about freedom of speech and the press. However, before he was sworn in for a second term, Fujimori stripped two universities of their autonomy and reshuffled the national electoral board. This led his opponents to call him "Chinochet," a reference to his previous nickname and to [[Chile]]an ruler [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Latin America 2010 |last=Buckman |first=Robert T. |year=2010 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=[[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]] |isbn=978-1-935264-12-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll by the Peruvian Research and Marketing Company conducted in 1997, 40.6% of Lima residents considered President Fujimori an authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;Cathleen Caron, [http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/06/1peru.cfm Judiciary Firmly Under Control in Fujimori's Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207051241/http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/06/1peru.cfm |date=7 February 2012 }}, ''[[Human Rights Brief]]'', Volume 6 Issue 1 (1999). p.9 ''et. seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Atwood, 'Democratic Dictators: Authoritarian Politics in Peru from Leguia to Fujimori,' ''[[SAIS Review]]'', vol. 21, no. 2 (2001), p. 167.{{ doi|10.1353/sais.2001.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, 'Neopopulism and Neoliberalism in Latin America: Unexpected Affinities,' ''[[Studies in Comparative International Development]]'', vol. 31, no. 3 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the fate of democracy under Fujimori, Peruvians were becoming increasingly interested in the myriad allegations of criminality that involved Fujimori and his chief of the [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|National Intelligence Service (SIN)]], [[Vladimiro Montesinos]]. Using SIN, Fujimori gained control of the majority of the armed forces, with ''[[Financial Times]]'' stating that "[i]n no other country in Latin America did a president have so much control over the armed forces".&lt;ref name="FTWD2"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Financial Times]] World Desk Reference|last1=Heritage|first1=Andrew|date=December 2002|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=|isbn=9780789488053|location=|pages=462-465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 report by Health Minister {{Interlanguage link multi|Fernando Carbone|es|3=Fernando Carbone Campoverde}} later suggested that Fujimori was involved in the [[Compulsory sterilization#Peru|forced sterilizations]] of up to 300,000 indigenous women between 1996 and 2000, as part of a population control program.&lt;ref name="Sterilization" /&gt; A 2004 [[World Bank]] publication said that in this period Montesinos' abuse of the power Fujimori granted him "led to a steady and systematic undermining of the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;"State Society Interactions as Sources of Persistence and Change in Inequality" in ''Inequality in Latin America: Breaking With History?''

==Third term==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main|Peruvian national election, 2000}}

The 1993 constitution limited a presidency to two terms. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of "authentic interpretation" which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000. A 1998 effort to repeal this law by referendum failed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1999, Fujimori announced that he would run for a third term. Peruvian electoral bodies, which were politically sympathetic to Fujimori, accepted his argument that the two-term restriction did not apply to him, as it was enacted while he was already in office.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Krauss, [https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/americas/122899peru-fujimori.html Peru's Chief to Seek 3rd Term, Capping a Long Legal Battle], 'New York Times'', 28 December 1999. Retrieved 26 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exit polls showed Fujimori fell short of the 50% required to avoid an electoral runoff, but the first official results showed him with 49.6% of the vote, just short of outright victory. Eventually, Fujimori was credited with 49.89%—20,000 votes short of avoiding a runoff. Despite reports of numerous irregularities, the international observers recognized an adjusted victory of Fujimori. His primary opponent, [[Alejandro Toledo]], called for his supporters to spoil their ballots in the runoff by writing "No to fraud!" on them (voting is mandatory in Peru). International observers pulled out of the country after Fujimori refused to delay the runoff.

In the runoff, Fujimori won with 51.1% of the total votes. While votes for Toledo declined from 37.0% of the total votes cast in the first round to 17.7% of the votes in the second round, invalid votes jumped from 8.1% of the total votes cast in the first round to 31.1% of total votes in the second round.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;{{cite book

Although Fujimori won the runoff with only a bare majority, rumors of irregularities led most of the international community to shun his third swearing-in on 28 July. For the next seven weeks, there were daily demonstrations in front of the presidential palace. As a conciliatory gesture, Fujimori appointed former opposition candidate [[Federico Salas]] as prime minister. However, opposition parties in Parliament refused to support this move, and Toledo campaigned vigorously to have the election annulled. At this point, a corruption scandal involving [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] broke out, and exploded into full force on the evening of 14 September 2000, when the cable television station [[Canal N]] broadcast footage of Montesinos apparently bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri for defecting to Fujimori's ''Perú 2000'' party. The video was presented by [[Fernando Olivera]], leader of the FIM (Independent Moralizing Front), who purchased it from one of Montesinos's closest allies{{who|date=June 2016}} (nicknamed by the Peruvian press ''El Patriota'').

Fujimori's support virtually collapsed, and a few days later he announced in a nationwide address that he would shut down the SIN and call new elections, in which he would not be a candidate. On 10 November, Fujimori won approval from Congress to hold elections on 8 April 2001. On 13 November, Fujimori left Peru for a visit to [[Brunei]] to attend the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum. On 16 November, [[Valentín Paniagua]] took over as president of Congress after the pro-Fujimori leadership lost a vote of confidence. On 17 November, Fujimori traveled from Brunei to Tokyo, where he submitted his presidential [[resignation]] via fax. Congress refused to accept his resignation, instead voting 62–9 to remove Fujimori from office on the grounds that he was "permanently morally disabled."

On 19 November, government ministers presented their resignations en bloc. Because Fujimori's first vice president, [[Francisco Tudela]], had broken with Fujimori and resigned a few days earlier, his successor Ricardo Márquez came to claim the presidency. Congress, however, refused to recognize him, as he was an ardent Fujimori loyalist; Márquez resigned two days later. Paniagua was next in line, and became interim president to oversee the April elections.

==Terrorism==

{{See also|Tarata bombing|Japanese embassy hostage crisis}}
When Fujimori came to power, much of Peru was dominated by the [[Maoism|Maoist]] insurgent group Sendero Luminoso ("[[Shining Path]]"), and the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] group [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA). In 1989, 25% of Peru's district and provincial councils opted not to hold elections, owing to a persistent campaign of assassination, over the course of which over 100 officials had been killed by the Shining Path in that year alone. That same year, more than one-third of Peru's courts lacked a justice of the peace, because of Shining Path intimidation. Union leaders and military officials were also assassinated throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name= "Freeman"&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zonas donde se ha registrado actividad de Sendero Luminoso.png|thumb|right|200px|Areas where Shining Path was active in Peru.]]

By the early 1990s, some parts of the country were under the control of the insurgents, in territories known as "zonas liberadas" ("liberated zones"), where inhabitants lived under the rule of these groups and paid them taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Shining Path arrived in Lima, it organized "paros armados" ("armed strikes"), which were enforced by killings and other forms of violence. The leadership of the Shining Path was largely university students and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Two previous governments, those of [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] and [[Alan García]], at first neglected the threat posed by the Shining Path, then launched an unsuccessful military campaign to eradicate it, undermining public faith in the state and precipitating an exodus of elites.&lt;ref&gt;"By the time Fujimori was elected you had a population in the cities, and particularly in [[Lima]], that was living in fear." [https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2006/falloffujimori/special_goldman.html The Fall of Fujimori: Peru's war on terror] 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1992, Shining Path guerrilla attacks had claimed an estimated 20,000 lives over preceding 12 years. On 16 July 1992 the [[Tarata bombing|Tarata Bombing]], in which several car bombs exploded in Lima's wealthiest district, killed over 40 people; the bombings were characterized by one commentator as an "offensive to challenge President Albert Fujimori."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/18/world/car-bomb-blasts-in-peru-kill-18-and-hurt-140-in-wealthy-sector.html Car-Bomb Blasts in Peru Kill 18 And Hurt 140 in Wealthy Sector] 18 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The bombing at Tarata was followed up with a "weeklong wave of car bombings ... Bombs hit banks, hotels, schools, restaurants, police stations and shops ... [G]uerrillas bombed two rail bridges from the [[Andes]], cutting off some of Peru's largest copper mines from coastal ports."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/23/world/peruvian-guerrillas-test-government-with-bombs.html Peruvian Guerrillas Test Government With Bombs] 23 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori has been credited by many Peruvians with ending the fifteen-year reign of terror of the Shining Path. As part of his anti-insurgency efforts, Fujimori granted the military broad powers to arrest suspected insurgents and try them in secret military courts with few legal rights. This measure has often been criticized for compromising the fundamental democratic and human right to an open trial wherein the accused faces the accuser. Fujimori contended that these measures were both justified and also necessary. Members of the judiciary were too afraid to charge the alleged insurgents, and judges and prosecutors had very legitimate fears of reprisals against them or their families.&lt;ref&gt;Fujimori advances this argument in [[Ellen Perry]]'s documentary film, ''[[The Fall of Fujimori]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Fujimori's government armed rural Peruvians, organizing them into groups known as "[[Ronda Campesina|rondas campesinas]]" ("peasant patrols").

Insurgent activity was in decline by the end of 1992,&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Steve J. ''Shining and Other Paths: War and Society in Peru, 1980–1995''. 1998, page 307.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fujimori took credit for this abatement, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the [[DIRCOTE|DINCOTE]] (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and the Shining Path, including notorious Shining Path leader [[Abimael Guzmán]]. Guzmán's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian [[Ellen Perry]], Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzmán's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the image of his capture in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Perry's ''The Fall of Fujimori''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics charge that to achieve the defeat of the Shining Path, the Peruvian military engaged in widespread [[human rights]] abuses, and that the majority of the victims were poor highland countryside inhabitants caught in a crossfire between the military and insurgents. The final report of the Peruvian [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], published on 28 August 2003, brought out that Peruvian armed forces were also guilty of destroying villages and murdering countryside inhabitants whom they suspected of supporting insurgents. The majority of the atrocities committed between 1980 and 1995, however, were indeed the work of the Shining Path.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] began on 17 December 1996, when fourteen [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]] militants seized the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima during a party, taking hostage some four hundred diplomats, government officials, and other dignitaries. The action was partly in protest of prison conditions in Peru. During the four-month standoff, the ''Emerretistas'' gradually freed all but 72 of their hostages. The government rejected the militants' demand to release imprisoned MRTA members and secretly prepared an elaborate plan to storm the residence, while stalling by negotiating with the hostage-takers.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Paul. ''The Lima Embassy Siege and Latin American Terrorism''. 2006, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 1997, a team of military [[commando]]s, codenamed "[[Chavín de Huantar (military)|Chavín de Huantar]]", raided the building. One hostage, two military commandos, and all 14 MRTA insurgents were killed in the operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginperu.com/blogs/features/234 Japanese embassy hostage crisis in Peru started 10 years ago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106011927/http://www.livinginperu.com/blogs/features/234 |date=6 January 2007 }} 18 December 2006.

==Accusations of human rights abuses==
{{See also|Barrios Altos massacre|La Cantuta massacre|Operation Chavín de Huántar}}
Several organizations criticized Fujimori's methods against the [[Shining Path]] and the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]]. [[Amnesty International]] said "the widespread and systematic nature of human rights violations committed during the government of former head of state Albert Fujimori (1990–2000) in Peru constitute crimes against humanity under international law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kintera.org/site/c.luLVJ8MRKrH/b.1419663/k.BE3C/Home.htm Bring Former President Fujimori to Justice], Amnesty International.

The 1991 [[Barrios Altos massacre]] by members of the death squad ''[[Grupo Colina]]'', made up solely of members of the [[Military of Peru|Peruvian armed forces]], was one of the crimes that Peru cited in its request to Japan for his extradition in 2003.

From 1996 to 2000, the Fujimori government oversaw a massive forced sterilization campaign known as Voluntary Surgical Contraception. [[United Nations|The United Nations]] and other international aid agencies supported this campaign.

The success of the military operation in the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] was tainted by subsequent allegations that at least three and possibly eight of the insurgents were summarily executed by the commandos after surrendering. In 2002, the case was taken up by public prosecutors, but the [[Peruvian Supreme Court]] ruled that the military tribunals had jurisdiction. A military court later absolved them of guilt, and the "[[Chavín de Huantar]]" soldiers led the 2004 military parade. In response, in 2003 MRTA family members lodged a complaint with the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) accusing the Peruvian state of human rights violations, namely that the MRTA insurgents had been denied the "right to life, the right to judicial guarantees and the right to judicial protection". The IACHR accepted the case and is currently{{when|date=June 2016}} studying it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidh.org/annualrep/2004eng/Peru.136.03.eng.htm Report Nº 13/04, Petition 136/03, Admissibility, Eduardo Nicolas Cruz Sanchez et al., Peru, 27 February 2004], on the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) site.

He arranged meetings with the Supreme Court, tax authorities, and other powers in Peru to "coordinate the joint efforts to bring the criminal Fujimori from Japan." His vehemence in this matter at times compromised Peruvian law: forcing the judiciary and legislative system to keep guilty sentences without hearing Fujimori's defense; not providing Fujimori with representation when Fujimori was tried ''in absentia''; and expelling pro-Fujimori congressmen from the parliament without proof of the accusations against those congressmen. These expulsions were later reversed by the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/politica/24922_1.php Valle Riestra: Pedido de extradición de Fujimori será rechazado por Chile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124032807/http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/politica/24922_1.php |date=24 November 2005 }} RPP Noticias, 16 November 2005.

The Peruvian Congress authorized charges against Fujimori in August 2001.

Meanwhile, the Peruvian government found that Japan was not amenable to the extradition of Fujimori; a protracted diplomatic debate ensued, when Japan showed itself unwilling to accede to the extradition request. Fujimori had been granted Japanese citizenship after his arrival in the country, and the Japanese government maintained that Japanese citizens would not be extradited.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/perus-fujimori-enters-election/|title=Peru's Fujimori Enters Election|last=|first=|date=October 6, 2005|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, Congressman Dora Dávila, joined by Minister of Health Luis Soari, denounced Fujimori and several of his ministers for crimes against humanity, for allegedly having overseen [[forced sterilization]]s during his regime. In November, Congress approved an investigation of Fujimori's involvement in the airdrop of [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifles into the [[Colombia]]n jungle in 1999 and 2000 for guerrillas of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC). Fujimori maintained he had no knowledge of the arms-trading, and blamed Montesinos. By approving the charges, Congress lifted the immunity granted to Fujimori as a former president, so that he could be criminally charged and prosecuted.

Congress also voted to support charges against Fujimori for the detention and disappearance of 67 students from the central Andean city of [[Huancayo]] and the disappearance of several residents from the northern coastal town of [[Chimbote]] during the 1990s. It also approved charges that Fujimori mismanaged millions of dollars from Japanese charities, suggesting that the millions of dollars in his bank account were far too much to have been accumulated legally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3710848.stm New Evidence in Fujimori Scandal]. ''BBC'', 2 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, the Special Prosecutor established to investigate Fujimori released a report alleging that the Fujimori administration had obtained US$2 billion though graft.&lt;ref name="Forero"&gt;Forero, Juan.

''The New York Times'', 5 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this money came from Vladimiro Montesinos' web of corruption.&lt;ref name=Forero /&gt; The Special Prosecutor's figure of two billion dollars is considerably higher than the one arrived at by [[Transparency International]], an NGO that studies corruption. Transparency International listed Fujimori as having embezzled an estimated USD $600 million, which would rank seventh in the list of money embezzled by heads of government active within 1984-2004.&lt;ref name="2004ti" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laksamana.net/vnews.cfm?ncat=25&amp;news_id=6841|title=Suharto Tops World Corruption League|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717153615/http://www.laksamana.net/vnews.cfm?ncat=25&amp;news_id=6841|archivedate=17 July 2004|deadurl=bot: unknown|accessdate=2005-04-02|df=dmy}}, 25 March 2004, Laksamana.Net, Jakarta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori dismissed the judicial proceedings underway against him as "politically motivated", citing Toledo's involvement. Fujimori established a new political party in Peru, ''[[Sí Cumple]]'', working from Japan. He hoped to participate in the [[Peruvian general election, 2006|2006 presidential elections]], but in February 2004, the Constitutional Court dismissed this possibility, because the ex-president was specifically barred by Congress from holding any office for ten years. Fujimori saw the decision as unconstitutional, as did his supporters such as ex-congressmembers [[Luz Salgado]], [[Marta Chávez]] and [[Fernán Altuve]], who argued it was a "political" maneuver and that the only body with the authority to determine the matter was the [[National Jury of Elections|Jurado Nacional de Elecciones]] (JNE). [[Valentín Paniagua]] disagreed, suggesting that the Constitutional Court finding was binding and that "no further debate is possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.terra.com.pe/noticias/nacional/18/18990.html No hay nada más que discutir sobre candidatura de Fujimori], ''Noticias'' on terra.com.peru, 27 February 2006 credited to ''Andina''.

Fujimori's ''Sí Cumple'' (roughly translated, "He Keeps His Word") received more than 10% in many country-level polls, contending with [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] for the second place slot,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, James.

By March 2005, it appeared that Peru had all but abandoned its efforts to extradite Fujimori from Japan. In September of that year, Fujimori obtained a new Peruvian passport in Tokyo and announced his intention to run in the [[Peruvian general election, 2006|Peruvian national election, 2006]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He arrived in Chile in November 2005, but hours after his arrival there he was arrested.  Peru then requested his extradition.

While under house arrest in Chile, Fujimori announced plans to run in [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 2007|Japan's Upper House elections in July 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0725/p04s01-woap.html|title=Still wanted in Peru, Alberto Fujimori runs for office in Japan|date=2007-07-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2018-10-25|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujimori was extradited from Chile to Peru in September 2007.

===Pardon requests===

Press reports in late 2012 indicated that Fujimori was suffering from tongue cancer and other medical problems. His family asked President [[Ollanta Humala]] for a pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Fujimori Family Requests Pardon for Former Peruvian President, by William Neuman, New York Times, 11 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; President Humala rejected a pardon in 2013, saying that Fujimori's condition was not serious enough to warrant it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Peru president rules out pardon for ex-leader Fujimori|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36892762|accessdate=7 August 2016|work=[[BBC]]|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, with three days left in his term, President Humala said that there was insufficient time to evaluate a second request to pardon Fujimori, leaving the decision to his successor [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Alberto Fujimori Files New Request for Presidential Pardon|url=http://www.peruviantimes.com/25/alberto-fujimori-files-new-request-for-presidential-pardon/27136/|website=Andean Air Mail &amp; Peruvian Times|publisher=Eleanor Griffis|accessdate=7 August 2016|location=[[Lima]]|date=25 July 2016|quote=The Presidential Pardons Commission met this Monday to begin evaluating a request filed on Friday July 22 by ex-President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for crimes against humanity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taj |first1=Mitra |editor-last1=Fernandez |editor-first1=Clarence |title=Peru's Humala rules out pardoning Fujimori during his term|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/peru-fujimori-idUSL1N1AC05U |accessdate=7 August 2016|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=26 July 2016|quote=Humala, who will be replaced by centrist President-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on Thursday, said in a broadcast interview that a serious evaluation of Fujimori's pardon request would take at least a couple months.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 December 2017, President Kuczynski pardoned him on health grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/25/perus-jailed-ex-president-alberto-fujimori-pardoned-sparking-protests|title=Peru's jailed ex-president Alberto Fujimori pardoned, sparking protests|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 December 2017|author=Dan Collyns|accessdate=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuczynski's office stated that the hospitalized 79-year-old Fujimori had a "progressive, degenerative and incurable disease".

A spokesman for [[Popular Force]] alleged there was a pact that, in exchange for the pardon, Popular Force members helped Kuczynski fight ongoing impeachment proceedings.&lt;ref name="cnn pardon"/&gt;

On 3 October 2018, the Peruvian Supreme Court reversed Fujimori's pardon and ordered his return to prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/peru-high-court-overturns-pardon-alberto-fujimori|title=Peru's high court overturns pardon of former strongman Fujimori|last=Collyns|first=Dan|date=2018-10-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

=== Economic achievements ===
Fujimori is credited by many Peruvians for bringing stability to the country after the violence and hyperinflation of the García years. While it is generally agreed that the "Fujishock" brought short/middle-term macroeconomic stability, the long-term social impact of Fujimori's free market economic policies is still hotly debated.

Neoliberal reforms under Fujimori took place in three distinct phases: an initial "orthodox" phase (1990–92) in which technocrats dominated the reform agenda; a "pragmatic" phase (1993–98) that saw the growing influence of business elites over government priorities; and a final "watered-down" phase (1999–2000) dominated by a clique of personal loyalists and their [[Clientelism|clientelist]] policies that aimed to secure Fujimori a third term as president. Business was a big winner of the reforms, with its influence increasing significantly within both the state and society.&lt;ref name = "Arce 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last= Arce |first= Moisés |year= 2005 |title= Market Reform in Society: Post-Crisis Politics and Economic Change in Authoritarian Peru |location= University Park, PA |publisher= [[Penn State University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-271-02542-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High growth during Fujimori's first term petered out during his second term. "[[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]]" phenomena had a tremendous impact on the Peruvian economy during the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gastón Antonio Zapata Velasco, Kenneth Broad, et al., [http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/un/peru.html Peru Country Case Study: Impacts and Responses to the 1997–98 El Niño Event] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905164739/http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/un/peru.html |date=5 September 2006 }}, Peru Country Case Study supported by the International Research Institute for climate prediction (IRI) and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s Office of Global Programs as a contribution to the UNEP/NCAR/WMO/UNU/ISDR study for the UN Foundation.

Furthermore, FAO reported Peru reduced undernourishment by about 29% from 1990–92 to 1997–99.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/y1500e/y1500e03.htm Undernourishment around the world: Reductions in undernourishment over the past decade], part of [http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/y1500e/y1500e00.HTM The state of food insecurity in the world 2001], FAO Corporate Document Repository.

Peru was reintegrated into the global economic system, and began to attract [[Mineral industry of Peru|foreign investment]]. The sell-off of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephony, mobile telephony and Internet. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company, at a cost of $607 for a residential line.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.up.edu.pe/ciup/AER/textos/Fernandez-Baca.ppt Las Privatizaciones y la Pobreza en el Perú: Resultados y Desafios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721214646/http://www.up.edu.pe/ciup/AER/textos/Fernandez-Baca.ppt |date=21 July 2006 }} ([[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentation), unsigned, undated, on the site of El Área de Economía de la Regulación, Centro de Investigación de la Universidad del Pacífico (CIUP).

By the end of the decade, Peru's international currency reserves were built up from nearly zero at the end of García's term to almost US$10 billion. Fujimori also left a smaller state bureaucracy and reduced government expenses (in contrast to the historical pattern of bureaucratic expansion), a technically minded (but widely perceived as politicized) administration of public entities like [[SUNAT]] (the tax collection agency), a large number of new schools, not only in Lima but in Peru's small towns, more roads and highways, and new and upgraded communications infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} These improvements led to a revival in tourism, agroexport, industries and fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www2.congreso.gob.pe/Sicr/Prensa/heraldo.nsf/0/bc520537f55e0ec805256f3a006beff6?OpenDocument Primer reporte-resumen ...

===Criticism===
Detractors have observed that Fujimori was able to encourage large-scale mining projects with foreign corporations and push through mining-friendly legislation laws because the post auto-coup political picture greatly facilitated the process.

Some analysts state that some of the GDP growth during the Fujimori years reflects a greater rate of extraction of non-renewable resources by transnational companies; these companies were attracted by Fujimori by means of near-zero royalties, and, by the same fact, little of the extracted wealth has stayed in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Chile, Peru – How much do mining companies contribute?

Fujimori's privatization program also remains shrouded in controversy. A congressional investigation in 2002, led by socialist opposition congressman [[Javier Díez Canseco|Javier Diez Canseco]], stated that of the USD $9 billion raised through the privatizations of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, only a small fraction of this income ever benefited the Peruvian people.

He was listed seventh and he was said to have amassed $600 million, but despite years of incarceration and investigation, none of these supposed stolen funds have ever been located in any bank account anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |title=World's Ten Most Corrupt Leaders1 |publisher=Infoplease.com Source: Transparency International Global Corruption Report 2004.|date= |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.transparency.org/content/download/479/1974/file/2004_GCR_PoliticalCorruption_EN.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |date= |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
Fujimori did have support within Peru. The Universidad de Lima March 2003 poll, taken while he was in Japan, found a 41% approval rating for his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/20/news/adfg-fujimori20 |title=In Japan, Fujimori Covets Post in Peru: Disgraced president plots his return to power in a land that accuses him of murder, treason and embezzlement|date=July 20, 2003|author=Natalie Obiko Pearson |agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted in March 2005 by the Instituto de Desarrollo e Investigación de Ciencias Económicas (IDICE) indicated that 12.1% of the respondents intended to vote for Fujimori in the 2006 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewItem&amp;itemID=6543 García, Fujimori Top Candidates In Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025170504/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewItem&amp;itemID=6543 |date=25 October 2005 }}, ''Angus Reid Global Monitor'' (Angus Reid Consultants), 30 March 2005.

Retrieved 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; An article from ''La Razon'', a Peruvian newspaper, stated in 2003 that: "Fujimori is only guilty of one big crime and it is that of having been successful in a country of failed politicians, creators of debt, builders of mirages, and downright opportunistic."

According to a more recent [[University of Lima|Universidad de Lima]] survey, Fujimori still retains public support, ranking fifth in personal popularity among other political figures. Popular approval for his decade-long presidency (1990–2000) has reportedly grown (from 31.5% in 2002 to 49.5% in May 2007).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Despite accusations of corruption and human rights violations, nearly half of the individuals interviewed in the survey approved of Fujimori's presidential regime.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In a 2007 [[University of Lima|Universidad de Lima]] survey of 600 Peruvians in Lima and the port of Callao, 82.6% agreed that the former president should be extradited from Chile to stand trial in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/15709 Peruvians Call for Fujimori's Extradition]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Angus Reid Global Monitor'' (Angus Reid Consultants), 12 May 2007. Retrieved 19 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lima-based newspaper ''Perú 21'' ran an editorial noting that even though the [[University of Lima|Universidad de Lima]] poll results indicate that four out of every five interviewees believe that Fujimori is guilty of some of the charges against him, he still enjoys at least 30% of popular support and enough approval to restart a political career.

In the 2006 congressional elections, his daughter [[Keiko Fujimori|Keiko]] was elected to the congress with the highest vote count. She came in second place in the [[Peruvian general election, 2011|2011 Peruvian presidential election]] with 23.2% of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elecciones2011.onpe.gob.pe/resultados2011/1ravuelta/onpe/presidente/rep_resumen_pre.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411191131/http://www.elecciones2011.onpe.gob.pe/resultados2011/1ravuelta/onpe/presidente/rep_resumen_pre.php |archivedate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lost the June run-off against [[Ollanta Humala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/06/06/peru.runoff/index.html|title=Left-leaning Humala wins Peruvian presidential election|author1=Rafael Romo |author2=Helena DeMoura|publisher=CNN|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She again ran for President in the [[Peruvian general election, 2016|2016 election]], narrowly losing the run-off to [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]].

'''Anarcho-conservatism''' or '''conservative anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Anarcho-conservatism opposes the state and all government control, while supporting social conservative policies. Conservative anarchism opposes state coercion but does not necessarily object to a naturally occurring hierarchy in certain social situations, e.g. religious institutions. Finally, it advocates the abolition of the state and the wholesale replacement of state law by moral laws. Differently from [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], anarcho-conservatives don't oppose all authority, but in consonance with them, they do oppose the authority of the modern nation state, which they deem artificial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/07/daniel-mccarthy/anarcho-conservatism/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|work=LewRockwell.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, conservative anarchists might oppose abortion, drug use and pornography, on moral grounds, while at the same time opposing their prohibition through government. This absolute rejection of the state legislation is what differentiates anarcho-conservatism from [[Libertarian conservatism|libertarianism conservatism]]. As conservatives typically do, conservative anarchists support traditional family structures and, much like all [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] orientations, support gun and property rights. These however take a backseat to traditional and religious morality, if a conflict between them arises. In particular, this differentiates anarcho-conservatism from anarcho-capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=conservative%20anarchist|title=Urban Dictionary: conservative anarchist|website=Urban Dictionary|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-conservatism has much in common with [[paleolibertarianism]], except the the support of right wing populists in political elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://libertarianuniverse.com/2015/08/20/anarcho-conservatism-explained-by-vincent-john/|title=Anarcho-Conservatism Explained|date=2015-08-20|work=LibertarianUniverse: A Right-Libertarian Blog|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian anarchism]] is an instance of anarcho-conservatism.

== History ==

=== Old Testament ===
[[Jacques Ellul]], a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the final verse of the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 21:25) states that there was no king in Israel and that "everyone did as they saw fit".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, as recorded in the first [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (1 Samuel 8) the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] wanted a king "so as to be like other nations".&lt;ref&gt;

God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to [[militarism]], [[conscription]] and [[Tax#History|taxation]], and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. [[Samuel]] passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they still demanded a king, and [[Saul]] became their ruler.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Modern age ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Young England movement of the 1830s and ‘40s argued that the more feudal models of traditional aristocracy and land ownership within the framework of communities which are self-policing (i.e. each community is autonomous rather than imposed by the state) was the best path to liberty, rather than mainstream liberal models. In short, Tory anarchists might have defended traditional and hereditary institutions like monarchy and aristocracy, but they had anarchist sympathies in the sense that they did not believe in a centralised, unitary government, and sometimes saw a reactionary counterrevolution as the only path to political success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theburkean.co.uk/anarcho-conservatism-even-thing/|title=Anarcho-conservatism – Is that even a thing?|date=2017-10-01|work=The Burkean|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Tory anarchist was first coined by Orwell to describe both Jonathan Swift and himself, and at its broadest it describes someone who is both a radical and a traditionalist. To be a Tory anarchist, then, is to embrace all manner of contradictions. It is a defence of good manners, good grammar, local customs and practices, respect for the individual and for privacy and an overwhelming hostility to the expanding power of the modern state. … Orwell saw Tory anarchism as a part of Britain's, mainly England's, rich social history, manifesting itself in particular figures at different times and places. These figures include not only Swift but Parson Bull, William Cobbett, Bishop Phillpotts and Richard Oastler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The strange case of Tory anarchism|last=1963-|first=Wilkin, Peter|date=2010|publisher=Libri Pub|isbn=9781907471100|location=Faringdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=662410383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There’s not a Tory anarchist tradition exactly, but the label has been applied, with good reason, to writers like Albert Jay Nock, Evelyn and Auberon Waugh, Mencken, Florence King, Dwight Macdonald, even Orwell and Max Beerbohm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ordinary-times.com/2011/01/03/tory-anarchism-in-america-an-interview-with-daniel-mccarthy/|title=Tory Anarchism in America: An Interview with Daniel McCarthy - Ordinary Times|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=2011-01-03|work=Ordinary Times|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoppe generally describes himself as libertarian or anarcho-capitalist, but I cannot see that he would reject the ultra-conservative label, or I certainly do not see how can do so consistently, since he prefers monarchy to democracy. That is he prefers rule by one hereditary individual to rule by a representative assembly, or by direct democracy, and clearly regards the global move from monarchy to democracy as regrettable. His explanation is that a hereditary ruler has a great interest in maintaining the state since it belongs to that ruler and the descendants of that ruler in perpetuity. The hereditary ruler’s interest in maintaining the state is certainly greater than that of elected politicians, as these politicians are temporary and have a greater interest in extracting resources from the state than in maintaining it’s long term existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/09/hoppe-habermas%E2%80%99s-anarcho-conservative-student/|title=Hoppe: Habermas’s Anarcho-Conservative Student|work=StephanKinsella.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Anarcho-conservative Quotes from Notable Authors ==

=== Albert Jay Nock (1870 – 1945) ===
[[Albert Jay Nock]] was the editor of ''[[The Freeman]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone knows that the State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime that I spoke of a moment ago, and that it makes this monopoly as strict as it can. It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or alien. There is, for example, no human right, natural or Constitutional, that we have not seen nullified by the United States Government. Of all the crimes that are committed for gain or revenge, there is not one that we have not seen it commit — murder, mayhem, arson, robbery, fraud, criminal collusion and connivance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Sosy1SDXYNUC|title=On Doing the Right Thing|last=Nock|first=Albert Jay|date=1956|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610163781|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== J.R.R. Tolkien (1892 – 1973) ===
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] was [[Merton Professors|Professor of English Language and Literature]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], and the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.&lt;blockquote&gt;My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning the abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) — or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate real of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! … Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so to refer to people … The most improper job of any many, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity … There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamating factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as ‘patriotism’, may remain a habit! But it won’t do any good, if it is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9eLCAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Letters+of+J.R.R.+Tolkien|title=The Letters of J.R.R.

=== Paul Weyrich (1942 – 2008) ===
[[Paul Weyrich]] was the co-founder of [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[The Free Congress Foundation]], and the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that we probably have lost the culture war. That doesn’t mean the war is not going to continue, and that it isn’t going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important. Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture. I would point out to you that the word "holy" means "set apart", and that it is not against our tradition to be, in fact, "set apart". You can look in the Old Testament, you can look at Christian history. You will see that there were times when those who had our beliefs were definitely in the minority and it was a band of hardy monks who preserved the culture while the surrounding society disintegrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815232714/http://www.freecongress.org:80/fcf/specials/weyrichopenltr.htm|title=Free Congress Foundation Online ---|date=2000-08-15|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hans-Hermann Hoppe (b. 1949) ===
[[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], Senior Fellow of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and founder and president of the [[Property and Freedom Society]].&lt;blockquote&gt;Many libertarians hold the view that all that is needed to maintain a libertarian social order is the strict enforcement of the non-aggression principle (NAP). Otherwise, as long as one abstains from aggression, according to their view, the principle of “live and let live” should hold. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control (and many youngsters have been initially attracted to libertarianism believing that this “live and let live” is the essence of libertarianism), and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does ''not'' hold and apply, or rather it is ''insufficient'', when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://misesuk.org/2017/10/20/libertarianism-and-the-alt-right-hoppe-speech-2017/|title=Libertarianism and the Alt-Right (Hoppe Speech, 2017)|date=2017-10-19|work=The Ludwig von Mises Centre|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Daniel McCarthy is the editor of ''[[Modern Age (periodical)|Modern Age]],'' director of the Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship Program at [[The Fund for American Studies]], and former editor of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (2010 – 2016).&lt;blockquote&gt;Conservatism and anarchism share some historical background, as reactions against liberalism, and they share some critiques of liberalism.&amp;nbsp; It’s not that liberalism — broadly construed to include the “classical” variety in practice as well as the modern version — is the worst socio-political system imaginable.&amp;nbsp; The various totalitarianisms of the 20th century were far worse, and anarchists and conservatives alike have to be careful that in making a deep critique of liberalism they’re not opening the door to something far deadlier. But liberalism is not the end of history, and it’s not the final picture of justice.&amp;nbsp;Under the guise of democracy and markets, and human rights, various kinds of powers and interests are able to run quite unchecked.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But for their own sake, as well as the sake of the civilization which they love, conservatives can and should deny the state’s legitimacy, on the grounds that it is destructive of the true, the good, and the beautiful. Affirming sovereignty in the hopes it may someday fall within conservative hands is a siren song that must be resisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2017/10/conservatism-seek-destroy-state-alexander-salter.html|title=Should Conservatism Seek to Destroy the State? ~ The Imaginative Conservative|date=2017-10-17|work=The Imaginative Conservative|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ancoats and Clayton''' is a defunct electoral district or [[ward (politics)|ward]] in the north of the City of [[Manchester]] in [[North West England]]. The population of this ward at the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] was 16,141.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&amp;b=13689194&amp;c=Ancoats+and+Clayton&amp;d=14&amp;e=62&amp;g=6342302&amp;i=1001x1003x1032x1004&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1451917364422&amp;enc=1|title= City of Manchester ward population 2011 | website = neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk | publisher = [[Gov.uk]]|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the [[Ancoats]] and [[Clayton, Manchester|Clayton]] districts and part of the [[Northern Quarter (Manchester)|Northern Quarter]].

'''Antimilitarism''' (also spelt '''anti-militarism''') is a doctrine that opposes war, relying heavily on a critical theory of [[imperialism]] and was an explicit goal of the [[First International|First]] and [[Second International]]. Whereas [[pacifism]] is the doctrine that disputes (especially between countries) should be settled without recourse to violence, Paul B. Miller defines anti-militarism as ''"ideology and activities...aimed at reducing the civil power of the military and ultimately, preventing international war"''.&lt;ref&gt;''From Revolutionaries to Citizens : Antimilitarism in France, 1870–1914'' by Paul B. Miller. Duke University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8223-2757-0}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cynthia Cockburn]] defines an anti-militarist movement as one opposed to "[[Military dictatorship|military rule]], high military expenditure or the imposition of foreign bases in their country".&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Cockburn, ''Antimilitarism: Political and Gender Dynamics of Peace Movements''. London, Palgrave Macmillan. 2012. {{ISBN|0230359752}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Ceadel points out that anti-militarism is sometimes equated with [[pacificism]]—general opposition to war or violence, except in cases where force is deemed absolutely necessary to advance the cause of peace.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;Martin Ceadel, 'Thinking about peace and war''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0192192000}}, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction between antimilitarism and pacifism ==
[[Pacifism]] is the belief that disputes between nations can and should be settled peacefully. It is the opposition to war and the use of violence as a means of settling disputes. It can include the refusal to participate in military action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = pacifism|url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pacifism|journal = The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antimilitarism does not reject war in all circumstances, but rejects the [[Militarism|belief or desire to maintain a large and strong military organization in aggressive preparedness for war]].&lt;ref&gt;"Antimilitarism is not pacifism or the total rejection of war". Lisa M. Mundy, ''American militarism and anti-militarism in popular media, 1945–1970''. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2012. {{ISBN|9780786466504}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = militarism|url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/militarism|journal = The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms on violence==
[[File:Detail of the Piano Score of Oscar Straus' The Chocolate Soldier.jpg|thumb|Cover of the Piano Score for the [[light opera]] ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'', based on [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' – both of which make fun of armies and militarist virtues and present positively a deserter who runs away  from the battlefield and who carries chocolate instead of ammunition.]]

[[Anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]] advocated the use of violence as a form of [[direct action]], calling it "revolutionary violence", which he opposed in ''Reflections on Violence'' (1908) to the violence inherent in [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reflections of Violence, by Georges Sorel – History in Review|url = http://www.historyinreview.org/gsorel.html|website = www.historyinreview.org|access-date = 2016-02-16|first = Rochelle|last = Caviness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities are seen between Sorel and the [[International Workingmen's Association|International Workingmens' Association]] (IWA) theorization of [[propaganda of the deed]].

[[Walter Benjamin]], in his ''Critique of Violence'' (1920) demarcates a difference between "violence that founds the law", and "violence that conserves the law", on one hand, and on the other hand, a "divine violence" that breaks the "magic circle" between both types of "state violence".  What distinguishes these two kinds of violence fundamentally is their mode of operation; whereas law-establishing and law-preserving violence operate instrumentally on a continuum of means and ends, wherein the means of physical violence justify the political-juridical ends of the law, the Benjaminian concept of 'divine violence' is unique insofar as it is a bloodless violence 'of pure means' through which the law itself is destroyed. The example Benjamin provides in his essay is that of a [[General Strike]], the latter of which is a key element of Sorel's Reflections on Violence (cited in this essay by Benjamin). The "violence that conserves the law" is roughly equivalent to the state's monopoly of legitimate violence. The "violence that founds the law" is the original violence necessary to the creation of a state. "Revolutionary violence" removes itself from the sphere of the law by shattering its instrumental logic of violence  (i.e. its deployment of violence as a means of instituting, preserving and enforcing its own authority).  &lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, ''Zür Kritik der Gewalt'' (1920) in ''Gesammelte Schriften'', vol. II, 1 (1977) ("Criticisms on Violence")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Agamben]] showed the theoretical link between the law and violence permitted Nazi-thinker [[Carl Schmitt]] to justify the "[[state of exception]]" as the characteristic of [[sovereignty]]. Thus indefinite suspension of the law may only be blocked by breaking this link between violence and right.

== Henry David Thoreau's anti-military views ==

[[Image:Mihály Zichy The Triumph of the Genius of Destruction 1878.jpeg|thumb|250px| [[Mihály Zichy]] painting "The Victory of the Genius of Destruction", made for [[Exposition Universelle (1878)| Paris Exposition]] of 1878,  was banned by French authorities because of its daring antimilitarist message.]]
[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s 1849 essay "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]" ([[wikisource:Civil Disobedience|see text]]), originally titled "Resistance to Civil Government", can be considered an antimilitarist point of view. His refusal to pay taxes is justified as an act of protest against [[slavery]] and against the [[Mexican–American War]], in accordance to the practice of [[civil disobedience]]. (1846–48).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anti-militarism in the 19th Century|url = http://jjohansen.net/2014/01/05/anti-militarism-in-the-19th-century/|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes in his essay that the individual is not with obligations to the majority of the State. Instead the individual should "break the law" if the law is "of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Thoreau: Civil Disobedience {{!}} Walden Woods|url = https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/Civil_Disobedience|website = www.walden.org|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitalism and the military-industrial complex==
[[Capitalism]] has often been thought by antimilitarist literature to be a major cause of wars, an influence which has been theorized by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] under the name of "[[imperialism]]". The [[military-industrial complex]] has been accused of "pushing for war" in pursuit of private economic or financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = War and Economic History|url = http://www.joshuagoldstein.com/jgeconhi.htm|website = www.joshuagoldstein.com|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second International]] was opposed to the participation of the working classes in war, which was analyzed as a competition between different national [[bourgeois]] classes and different state imperialisms. The assassination of French [[Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière|socialist]] leader [[Jean Jaurès]] days before the proclamation of World War I resulted in massive participation in the coming war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First World War.com – Who's Who – Jean Jaures|url = http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/jaures.htm|publisher = www.firstworldwar.com|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The other assassination that led up to World War I|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/07/31/the-other-assassination-that-led-up-to-world-war-i/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2014-07-31|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Ishaan|last = Tharoor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Mars; or,The Truth About War'' (1921), [[Émile Chartier|Alain]] criticizes the destruction brought about by [[militarism]], and demonstrated that it wasn't [[patriotism]] that forced the soldiers to fight, but the [[bayonet]]s behind them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alain {{!}} French philosopher|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Alain|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, US President [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s 1961 issued a warning on the influence of the "[[military-industrial complex]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Military-Industrial Complex Speech, Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961|url = http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~hst306/documents/indust.html|website = coursesa.matrix.msu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Right-wing antimilitarism in the United States ==
American right-wing antimilitarists draw heavily upon the statements of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] condemning standing armies and foreign entanglements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Civilian and the Military: A History of the American Antimilitarist Tradition|url = http://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=88#t-2|website = The Independent Institute|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's beliefs on maintaining a standing army are as follows: "There are instruments so dangerous to the rights of the nation and which place them so totally at the mercy of their governors that those governors, whether legislative or executive, should be restrained from keeping such instruments on foot but in well-defined cases. Such an instrument is a standing army."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jefferson on Politics &amp; Government: The Military|url = http://famguardian.org/Subjects/Politics/ThomasJefferson/jeff1480.htm|website = famguardian.org|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-wing antimilitarists in the United States generally believe that "A well regulated [[militia]], composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country", as stated by [[James Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The James Madison Research Library and Information Center|url = http://madisonbrigade.com/library_jm.htm|website = madisonbrigade.com|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, there is much overlap between the [[Militia movement]] and right-wing antimilitarists, although the two groups are not mutually inclusive. The term "well regulated" in the above quote (and in the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]]) is taken by such antimilitarists not to mean "regulated by the state" but rather "well equipped" and "in good working order", as was a common usage of the word "regulated" in the late 18th century.

==Antimilitarism in Japan==
After World War II Japan enacted its [[Constitution of Japan|postwar constitution]] which, in article 9, stated that "The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." Such antimilitarist constitution was based on the belief that Japan's military organizations were to blame for thrusting the country into World War II.

In Yasuhiro Izumikawa's article "Explaining Japanese Antimilitarism: Normative and Realist Constraints on Japan's Security Policy", the evidences for the constructivist's belief in the existence of the single norm of antimilitarism in Post war Japan are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Izumikawa|first1=Yasuhiro|title=Explaining Japanese Antimilitarism: Normative and Realist Constraints on Japan's Security Policy|journal=International Security|date=October 2010 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=123–160 |doi=10.1162/ISEC_a_00020|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00020|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These evidences include the [[Yoshida Doctrine]], adopted after the World War II, which emphasized the importance of Japan’s economic development and acceptance of the U.S. security umbrella. Also the institutional constraints imposed on Japan’s security policy after World War II and Japan’s [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]] which is about not possessing, producing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear  weapons into Japan are mentioned as the evidences for antimilitarism. In contrast to the constructivist's view, in Izumikawa's article, the realists are said to believe that the postwar security policy in Japan is a combination of pacifism, antitraditionalism, and the fear of entrapment rather than just being based on the single norm of antimilitarism.

However, the postwar constitution on which Japan’s antimilitarism is based has seen some proposed amendments, and article 9 has been renounced by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. Some [[2015 Japanese military legislation|new legislation]] allows Japan’s Self Defense Forces to act more like a conventional army, reinterpreting the constitutional restrictions. This legislation has been strongly opposed by Japanese opposition parties, especially the [[Japanese Communist Party]], which is strongly opposed to militarism.

== Antimilitarist groups ==
{{see also|List of anti-war organizations|Peace movement}}

Until its dissolution, the [[Second International]] was antimilitarist. Jaurès' assassination on July 31, 1914, marks antimilitarism's failure in the socialist movement. The [[American Union Against Militarism]] is an example of a US antimilitarist movement born in the midst of the First World War, from which the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) formed from after the war. In 1968, [[Benjamin Spock]] signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also arrested for his involvement in anti-war protests resulting from his signing of the anti-war manifesto "A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority" circulated by members of the collective [[RESIST (non-profit)|RESIST]].&lt;ref&gt;Barsky, Robert F. Noam Chomsky: a life of dissent. 1st ed. Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1998.

"Boston Grand Jury Indicts Five For Working Against Draft Law." Harvard Crimson. 08 Jan 1968: n. page. Web. 4 Jun. 2014. &lt;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/1/8/boston-grand-jury-indicts-five-for/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Refusenik (Israel)|''Refuseniks'']] in Israel, who refuse the draft, and draft resisters in the USA can be considered by some to be antimilitarist or pacifist.

[[War Resisters' International]], formed in 1921, is an international network of pacifist and animilitarist groups around the world, currently with 90 affiliated groups in over 40 countries.

Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized [[pogrom]]s by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the [[Rhineland massacres]] preceding the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion]] from England in 1290, the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|massacres of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the persecutions of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising#Jews|Cossack massacres in Ukraine]] from 1648 to 1657, various [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 [[Dreyfus affair]] in France, [[the Holocaust]] in [[Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]], official [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Jewish policies]], and Arab and Muslim involvement in the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].

The root word ''[[Wikt:Semite|Semite]]'' gives the [[misnomer|false impression]] that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic people]], ''e.g.'', including [[Arabs]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The compound word ''antisemite'' was popularized in Germany in 1879{{sfn|Bein|1990|p=595}} as a scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' ("Jew-hatred"),{{sfn|Chanes|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Rattansi|2007|p=4–5}}{{sfn|Roth|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Johnston|1983|p=27}}&lt;ref name=laqueur1&gt;{{harvp|Laqueur|2006}}.

==Origin and usage in the context of xenophobia==

===Etymology===
{{anchor|Etmyology and uses}}
[[File:Statuten der Antisemiten-Liga.jpg|thumb|1879 statute of the Antisemitic League]]

The origin of "antisemitic" terminologies is found in the responses of [[Moritz Steinschneider]] to the views of [[Ernest Renan]]. As [[Alex Bein]] writes: "The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the "Semites" as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 |last=Bein |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Bein |title=The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1990 |page=594 |isbn=0-8386-3252-1 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avner Falk]] similarly writes: 'The German word ''antisemitisch'' was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how "[[Semitic people#Ethnicity and race|Semitic races]]" were inferior to "[[Aryan race]]s"'.&lt;ref name="'The ''antisemitisch'' 18 60 (1816-1907) ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Renan's "&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pseudoscience|Pseudoscientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poliakov |first=Léon |author-link=Léon Poliakov |title=The History of Anti-Semitism, Vol. 3: From Voltaire to Wagner |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2003 |page=404 |isbn=978-0-8122-1865-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term "Semitic" almost synonymously with "Jewish", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falk |first=Avner |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWL4ja2BbnEC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Anti-Semitism: A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Praeger |page=21 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; based generally on linguistic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brustein |first=William I. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=118 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to "stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan M. |last=Hess |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/18229 |title=Johann David Michaelis and the Colonial Imaginary: Orientalism and the Emergence of Racial Antisemitism in Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=6 |number=2 |date=Winter 2000 |pages=56–101 |doi=10.1353/jss.2000.0003 |quote=When the term "antisemitism" was first introduced in Germany in the late 1870s, those who used it did so in order to stress the radical difference between their own "antisemitism" and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism. |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]

In 1879 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet, ''Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet'' (''The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective'') in which he used the word ''Semitismus'' interchangeably with the word ''Judentum'' to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaspal |first=Rusi |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38 |title=Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: Representation, Cognition and Everyday Talk |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |chapter=Antisemitism: Conceptual Issues |access-date=27 October 2018}} Jaspal erroneously gives the date of publication as 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/Marr-Wilhelm-Der-Sieg-des-Judenthums-ueber-das-Germanenthum-2-2 Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet]''. Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition/printing. Archive.org. Marr uses the word "Semitismus" (Semitism) on pages 7, 11, 14, 30, 32, and 46; for example, one finds in the conclusion the following passage: "Ja, ich bin überzeutgt, ich habe ausgesprochen, was Millionen Juden im Stillen denken: Dem Semitismus gehört die Weltherrschaft!" (Yes, I am convinced that I have articulated what millions of Jews are quietly thinking: World domination belongs to Semitism!) (p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marr |first=Wilhem |author-link=Wilhelm Marr |url=http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/Marr-Text-English.pdf |title=The Victory of Judaism over Germanism: Viewed from a Nonreligious Point of View |translator-first=Gerhard |translator-last=Rohringer |year=1879 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of ''[[Wikt:Semitismus|Semitismus]]'' was followed by a coining of "[[Wikt:Antisemitismus|Antisemitismus]]" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum'' (''The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit'', 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word '' Antisemitismus'', "antisemitism".

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm Marr |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wilhelm-marr |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently named to follow the "Anti-Kanzler-Liga" (Anti-Chancellor League).&lt;ref name="MZ1987"/&gt; The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] reports, "In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use ("Allg. Zeit. d. Jud." 1881, p.&amp;nbsp;138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Anti-Semitism |first=Gotthard |last=Deutsch |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1603-anti-semitism  |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |page=641 (A) |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related term "[[Philo-Semitism|philosemitism]]" was coined around 1885.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Usage===
From the outset the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="MWdef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JustJews" /&gt; The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of [[Semitic languages]] (e.g. [[Arabs]], [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) who are not the objects of anti-Semitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' has been used to describe [[prejudice]] against people who speak other Semitic languages,  the validity of such usage has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin |last=Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442 |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004 |page=442 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=David Matas |last=Matas |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2005 |page=34 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be spelled with or without a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because, "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" whereas "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that."&lt;ref name="Almog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Almog |first=Shmuel |url=https://astro.temple.edu/~hfreiden/Antisemitism/whatis.htm |title=What's in a Hyphen? |access-date=27 October 2018}}, SICSA Report: Newsletter of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] (Summer 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Myth |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |website=Facing History |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305002701/http://www2.facinghistory.org/Campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/%24FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2009 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bauer |first1=Yehuda |title=Problems of Contemporary Antisemitism |url=http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307094003/http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |title=A History of the Holocaust |publisher=Franklin Watts |year=1982 |page=52 |isbn=0-531-05641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Emil Fackenheim]] supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to "[dispel] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes."&lt;ref name=Fackenheim&gt;{{harvp|Prager|Telushkin|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0llzUqQ2YC&amp;pg=PA199 199]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at [[Merrimack College]]; [[Yehuda Bauer]], professor of [[Holocaust studies]] at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]; and [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]], historian and novelist.

Objections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="MZ1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmermann |first=Moshe |title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536495-8 |page=112 |access-date=27 October 2018 |quote=The term "anti-Semitism" was unsuitable from the beginning for the real essence of Jew-hatred, which remained anchored, more or less, in the Christian tradition even when it moved via the natural sciences, into racism.

The founders of the new Organization adopted the elements of "anti" and "league," and searched for the proper term: Marr exchanged the term "Jew" for "Semite" which he already favored. It is possible that the shortened form "Sem" is used with such frequency and ease by Marr (and in his writings) due to its literary advantage and because it reminded Marr of Sem Biedermann, his Jewish employer from the Vienna period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sevenster1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sevenster |first=Jan Nicolaas |title=The Roots of Pagan Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLE3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |access-date=27 October 2018 |year=1975 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=978-90-04-04193-6 |pages=1–2 |quote=It has long been realised that there are objections to the term anti-Semitism and therefore an endeavour has been made to find a word which better interprets the meaning intended.

It certainly expresses better than anti-Semitism the fact that it concerns the attitude to the Jews and avoids any suggestion of racial distinction, which was not or hardly, a factor of any significance in ancient times. For this reason Leipoldt preferred to speak of anti-Judaism when writing his ''Antisemitsmus in der alien Welt'' (l933). Bonsirven also preferred this word to Anti-Semitism, "mot moderne qui implique une théorie des races".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to [[Olaf Blaschke]], has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews",&lt;ref name="pogromsriots"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sonja |last=Weinberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Pogroms and Riots: German Press Responses to Anti-Jewish Violence in Germany and Russia (1881–1882) |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2010 |access-date=27 October 2018 |isbn=9783631602140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious [[anti-Judaism]], antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world]]; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.&lt;ref name="pogromsriots" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|Caricature by C.Léandre (France, 1898) showing [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] with the world in his hands]]
[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on 24 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The [[United States Department of State]] states that "while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses." For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm "Report on Global Anti-Semitism"], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It also adds that "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," but that "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Evolution of usage===
In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Anti-Semitic League).&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy, "Marr, Wilhelm (1819–1904)" in {{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=vol. 2, pp. 445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8143-2055-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was "Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/11/archives/dr-karl-lueger-dead-antisemitic-leader-and-mayor-of-vienna-was-66.html Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old.] ''The New York Times'', 11 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer [[Leon Pinsker]], a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term ''Judeophobia'' to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word ''Judeophobia'' first appeared in his pamphlet "[[Auto-Emancipation]]", published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition.&lt;ref name="Bartlett2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven J.|title=The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5KQ0Yi76GMC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=2 June 2015|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398075576|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Judeophobia is a form of demonopathy, with the distinction that the Jewish ghost has become known to the whole race of mankind, not merely to certain races....

In the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 12 November 1938. Cited in [[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Kristallnacht: Prelude to Destruction''. Harper Collins, 2006, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1945 [[End of World War II in Europe|victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany]], and particularly after the full extent of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi genocide against the Jews]] became known, the term "anti-Semitism" acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.''

==Manifestations==
[[File:Medieval manuscript-Jews identified by rouelle are being burned at stake.jpg|thumb|Jews (identified by the mandatory [[Jewish badge]] and [[Jewish hat]]) being burned.]]
Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. [[René König]] mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods." König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie |first=René |last= König |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |page=231 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|isbn=978-3-8100-3306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. [[Bernard Lazare]] identifies three forms of antisemitism: [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]], economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes |first=Bernard |last=Lazare |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2006 |page=224|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-1-59605-601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as [[anti-Judaism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in [[the Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Harap separates "economic antisemitism" and merges "political" and "nationalistic" antisemitism into "ideological antisemitism". Harap also adds a category of "social antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature, 1900-1940s |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=24|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA24|isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* religious (Jew as Christ-killer),
* economic (Jew as banker, usurer, money-obsessed),
* social (Jew as social inferior, "pushy," vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),
* racist (Jews as an inferior "race"),
* ideological (Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary),
* cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

[[Gustavo Perednik]] has argued that what he terms "Judeophobia" has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Perednik, [http://www.zionism-israel.com/his/judeophobia.htm Judeophobia –  Anti-Semitism, Jew-Hate and anti-"Zionism"]&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote in his book ''The Judeophobia'' that "The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo |title=La Judeofobia: Cómo y Cuándo Nace, Dónde y Por Qué Pervive |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3IiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.&amp;dq=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.|publisher=Flor del Viento |year=2001 |page=26 |isbn=978-8489644588 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo Daniel |title=España descarrilada: terror islamista en Madrid y el despertar de Occidente |publisher=Inédita Editores |year=2004 |isbn=978-8496364042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Ruth Wisse]] has argued that antisemitism is a political ideology that authoritarians use to consolidate power by unifying disparate groups. One example she gives is the [[Criticism of the United Nations#Allegations of anti-Zionism and antisemitism|alleged antisemitism within the United Nations]], which, in this view, functioned during the [[Cold War]] as a coalition-building technique between Soviet and Arab states, but now serves the same purpose among states opposed to the type of human-rights ideology for which the UN was created. She also cites as an example the formation of the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref name="Wisse" /&gt;

===Cultural antisemitism===

Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76 |isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eric Kandel]] characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of "Jewishness" as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation."&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W.

An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.&lt;ref name=Kandel3031&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W.

===Religious antisemitism===

[[Religious antisemitism]], also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A concise history of American antisemitism |first=Robert |last=Michael |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2005|page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-7425-4313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]]." From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

Some Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial anti-Semitism, as in his statement that "From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent anti-Semitism of [[Édouard Drumont]], one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnal |first1=Oscar L. |title=Ambivalent Alliance: The Catholic Church and the Action Française, 1899-1939 |date=1985 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Richard L. |title=Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy |date=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic antisemitism===
The underlying premise of [[economic antisemitism]] is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.&lt;ref name=MeyerBrenner220&gt;{{cite book |title=German-Jewish History in Modern Times: Integration in dispute, 1871–1918 |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220|isbn=978-0-231-07476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting [[Antisemitic canard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews &amp; Money – The story of a stereotype|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228220753/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|archivedate=28 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his [[The Dearborn Independent|Dearborn Independent]]. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.
[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canard|canards]]:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that "are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor"
:b) Jews are "leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination"

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews are stingy and greedy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
#Powerful Jews control the business world&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of anti-Semitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded "that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well."&lt;ref&gt;D’Acunto, Francesco, et al.

===Racial antisemitism===

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or "Aryans", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The old laws restricting them to [[ghetto]]s, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–5. [[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007)''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white [[Aryan]]s to [[Semitic people|Semitic]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp. 57–9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power." Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |year=1983 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-940646-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.

{{Main|New antisemitism}}
Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of [[new antisemitism]], coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they argue that the language of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar [[Gustavo Perednik]] posited in 2004 that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and "proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031205153139/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791 "Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem"] in Rosenbaum, Ron (ed). ''Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism'', Random House 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the [[blood libel]].&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"/&gt;

Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate [[criticism of Israel|criticism of the State of Israel]], and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was—at least, in its classical form—nuanced in that Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; [[Christian antisemitism]], which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon of Alexandria|Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the "absurdity of [[Torah|their Law]]", making a mocking reference to how [[Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].&lt;ref name="gruen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Erich S.

In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian prejudices".&lt;ref name="Schäfer"&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 208.[[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schäfer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;Barclay, John M G, 1999.

''Philo's Flaccus: the First Pogrom'', Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series, Brill. [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the ''[[polis|poleis]]''.&lt;ref name=tcherikover&gt;Tcherikover, Victor, ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews'', New York: Atheneum, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.&lt;ref name=Bohak&gt;Bohak, Gideon. "The Ibis and the Jewish Question: Ancient 'Antisemitism' in Historical Context" in Menachem Mor et al., ''Jews and Gentiles in the Holy Land in the Days of the Second Temple, the Mishna and the Talmud'', Yad Ben-Zvi Press, 2003, pp. 27–43 {{ISBN|9652172057}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3265911|author=Daniels J.L.|title=Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=98 |issue=1|year=1979|pages=45–65|doi=10.2307/3265911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the gods." Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings."&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE.

The Jewish diaspora on the [[Nile River|Nile]] island [[Elephantine]], which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Colpe, Carsten (Berlin).

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were at times antagonistic and resulted in [[Jewish-Roman wars|several rebellions]]. According to [[Suetonius]], the emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th-century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews [[History of antisemitism#Late Roman Empire|gradually worsened]].

[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] asserted: "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors such as [[pogrom]]s and [[forced conversion|conversion]]s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

From the 9th century, the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] classified Jews and Christians as ''[[dhimmis]]'', and allowed Jews to practice their religion more freely than they could do in [[Middle Ages|medieval Christian Europe]]. Under [[Al-Andalus|Islamic rule]], there was a [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]] that lasted until at least the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=María Rosa|last=Menocal|author-link=María Rosa Menocal|title=The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain|date=April 2003|publisher=Back Bay Books|isbn=978-0-316-16871-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended when several Muslim [[pogrom]]s against Jews took place on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], including those that occurred in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in 1011 and in [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada in 1066]].&lt;ref name="Schweitzer267-268"&gt;{{harvp|Perry|Schweitzer|2002|pp=267–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harzig, Hoerder &amp; Shubert, 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Several decrees ordering the destruction of [[synagogue]]s were also enacted in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]] from the 11th century.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.

The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) hundreds or even thousands of [[Rhineland massacres|Jews were killed as the crusaders arrived.]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chazan, ''In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews'' (1996) [https://www.questia.com/library/5684490/in-the-year-1096-the-first-crusade-and-the-jews online]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first major outbreak of anti-Jewish violence in Christian Europe outside Spain and was cited by Zionists in the 19th century as indicating the need for a state of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Corliss K.

In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]], as well as [[Rintfleisch massacres|Rintfleisch knights]] in 1298. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all [[English people|English]] Jews; in 1394, the expulsion of 100,000 Jews in France;&lt;ref&gt;History of the reign of Charles VI, titled ''Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422'', encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1421, the expulsion of thousands from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |title=Why the Jews? – Black Death |accessdate=22 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211173212/http://www.holocaustcenterpgh.net/2-3.html |archivedate=11 December 2003 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval and Renaissance Europe, a major contributor to the deepening of antisemitic sentiment and legal action among the Christian populations was the popular preaching of the zealous reform religious orders, the Franciscans (especially Bernardino of Feltre) and Dominicans (especially Vincent Ferrer), who combed Europe and promoted antisemitism through their often fiery, emotional appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1999, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, causing the death of a large part of the population, Jews were used as [[scapegoating#Psychology and sociology|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|destroyed in numerous persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by issuing two [[papal bull]]s in 1348, the first on 6 July and an additional one several months later, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burned alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p. 47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these conflicts was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s supporters massacred tens of thousands of [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's [[Ukraine]]). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Dutch governor of [[New Amsterdam]], implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the [[American Revolutionary War]] that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Ed. by Paul S.|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-508209-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave [[Berlin]]" (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

===Voltaire===
According to Arnold Ages, [[Voltaire]]'s "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative".&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. "Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence." Neohelicon 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H. Meyer adds: "There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Paul H. "The Attitude of the Enlightenment Toward the Jew." Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, 26 (1963): 1177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire Philosophique]]'' concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, L.]] ''The History of Anti-Semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner''.

===Louis de Bonald and the Catholic Counter-Revolution===
The [[counter-revolutionary]] Catholic royalist [[Louis de Bonald]] stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Battini1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2–7 and 30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Jacob |title=From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 |date=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garṭner |first1=Aryeh |last2=Gartner |first2=Lloyd P. |title=History of the Jews in Modern Times |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joskowicz |first1=Ari |title=The Modernity of Others: Jewish Anti-Catholicism in Germany and France |date=2013 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |last2=Rosen |first2=Philip |title=Dictionary of Antisemitism from the Earliest Times to the Present |date=2007 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's article ''Sur les juifs'' (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], [[Charles Maurras]], and [[Édouard Drumont]], nationalists such as [[Maurice Barrès]] and [[Paolo Orano]], and anti-Semitic socialists such as [[Alphonse Toussenel]].&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanos |first1=Sandrine |title=The Aesthetics of Hate: Far-Right Intellectuals, Antisemitism, and Gender in 1930s France |date=2012 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laqueur |first1=Walter |last2=Baumel |first2=Judith Tydor |title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an "alien" people, a "state within a state", and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

Under the French Second Empire, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish "financial aristocracy" along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a "deicidal people" driven by hatred to "enslave" Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) has been called a "Bible of modern antisemitism" and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

===Imperial Russia===
Thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Cossack [[Haidamaka|Haidamaks]] in the 1768 [[massacre of Uman]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews into the [[Pale of Settlement]] &amp;ndash; which was located primarily in present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus &amp;ndash; and to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner].

Policy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under [[Czar Alexander II]] ({{reign|1855|1881}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, his assassination in 1881 served as a pretext for further repression such as the [[May Laws]] of 1882. [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], nicknamed the "black czar" and tutor to the [[czarevitch]], later crowned [[Czar Nicholas II]], declared that "One third of the Jews must die, one third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]],''The Romanovs 1818–1959'', Sutton, 1998, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in [[Muslim]] countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[Persian Jews]], describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |title=The Jews of Islam |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1984 |pages=181–183|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. [[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===
[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]
In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] – who has been called "the inventor of modern antisemitism"&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt; – published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly "Jewishness in Music"&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;[[Jonathan Steinberg|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388–90. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly "German" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;
 
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain" ("''Der gute Handel"'') and "The Jew Among Thorns" (''"Der Jude im Dorn"'').

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.&lt;ref name=BDE-Whitman&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe.

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[Liberalism|anti-liberal]] political party called the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harold M.

Wheen says that "Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, F., Karl Marx, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to McLellan, Marx used the word ''Judentum'' colloquially, as meaning ''commerce'', arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as "an extended pun at Bauer's expense".&lt;ref&gt;McLellan 1980, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;72]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]] in Europe. Christians used allegations of Jews killing Christians as a justification for the killing of Jews.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the [[interwar period]]. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-253-33809-9 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit to [[Nazi Germany]], a few weeks before the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was "more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized". The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags.

In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] prohibited sexual relations and marriages between "Aryans" and Jews as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race disgrace") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and [[half-Jew]]s, of their citizenship, (their official title became "subjects of the state").{{sfn|Majer|2014|pp=113, 116, 118}} It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to [[German-occupied Europe]] in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the [[Soviet Union]], starting with the conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Antisemitism in the USSR]] reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name="jcws"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov| title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism| journal=Journal of Cold War Studies| year=2002| volume=4:1| issue=Winter| pages=66–80| url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race| author1=Raphael| author2=Jennifer Patai| year=1989| page=178| publisher=Wayne State University Press| isbn=978-0-8143-1948-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]] (1952–1953).

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as [[blood libel]]s.

Retrieved 24 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 report by the U.S. [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] also noted a continued global increase in antisemitism, and found that Holocaust denial and opposition to Israeli policy at times was used to promote or justify blatant antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2012|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the ADL conducted a study titled "[http://global100.adl.org/ Global 100: An Index of Anti-Semitism]", which also reported high antisemitism figures around the world and, among other findings, that as many as "27% of people who have never met a Jew nevertheless harbor strong prejudices against him".&lt;ref name="TOI-ADL"&gt;{{cite web | last=Gur | first=Haviv Rettig | title=Hating the Jew you've never met | website=The Times of Israel | date=May 18, 2014 | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hating-the-jew-youve-never-met/ | access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algeria====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Algeria}}
Almost all Jews in [[Algeria]] left upon independence in 1962. Algeria's 140,000 Jews had French citizenship since 1870 (briefly revoked by Vichy France in 1940), and they mainly went to [[France]], with some going to [[Israel]].

====Egypt====
In [[Egypt]], Dar al-Fadhilah published a translation of [[Henry Ford]]'s antisemitic treatise, ''[[The International Jew]]'', complete with distinctly antisemitic imagery on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligence.org.il/eng/sib/4_04/as_egypt.htm Examples of anti-Semitism in the Arab and Muslim world] on intelligence.org.il, site of the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies (C.S.S), Israel. Retrieved 24 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 2001, after [[Shimon Peres]] visited [[Egypt]], the Egyptian ''[[Al Akhbar (Egypt)|al-Akhbar]]'' internet paper said that "lies and deceit are not foreign to Jews[...]. For this reason, Allah changed their shape and made them into monkeys and pigs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/egyptian_media/media_2002/stereotypes.asp Anti-Semitism in the Egyptian Media: February 2001 – February 2002], "Classic Anti-Semitic Stereotypes", [[Anti-Defamation League]]. Retrieved 4 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Egypt's Al Nahar channel fooled actors into thinking they were on an Israeli television show and filmed their reactions to being told it was an Israeli television show. In response, some of the actors launched into antisemitic rants or dialogue, and many became violent. Actress Mayer El Beblawi said that "Allah did not curse the worm and moth as much as he cursed the Jews" while actor Mahmoud Abdel Ghaffar launched into a violent rage and said, "You brought me someone who looks like a Jew... I hate the Jews to death" after finding out it was a prank.&lt;ref name="Anti-semitism candid camera Egypt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=278645 | title=Violent anti-Semitism applauded on Egypt TV | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=24 July 2012 | accessdate=24 July 2012 | author=Lappin, Yaakov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Candid camera egypt Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/egyptian-actor-slaps-and-fells-female-host-denounces-israelis-in-egyptian-tv-prank-gone-wrong/ | title=Egyptian actor slaps and fells female host, denounces Israelis, in Egyptian TV ‘prank’ gone wrong | work=The Times of Israel | date=24 July 2012 | accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Libya}}
[[Libya]] had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of [[Tripoli|Libya]] till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.

==== Morocco ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}

[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of [[1033 Fez massacre|6,000 Jews in Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morocco"&gt;For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180–182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.
In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)
In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.
In June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:
In 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm] By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.
The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].

==== South Africa ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in South Africa}}

Antisemitism has been present in history of [[South Africa]] since Europeans first set foot ashore on the [[Cape Peninsula]]. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Milton | first =Shain | title =The roots of antisemitism in South Africa | publisher =Wiwatersrand University Press | year =1994 | location =Johannesburg | pages =9–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitism reached its apotheosis in the years leading up to [[World War II]]. Inspired by the rise of [[national socialism]] in [[Germany]] the [[Ossewabrandwag]] (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 [[Afrikaner]] population – and the National Party faction ''New Order'' would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/23.htm|title=South Africa - The Impact of World War II|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tunisia ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}

Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.
Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.
In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a suicide bombing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrucci|first=Filippo|last2=Fois|first2=Marisa|date=2016-03-03|title=Attitudes towards Israel in Tunisian political debate: from Bourguiba to the new constitution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=21|issue=3|pages=392–410|doi=10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|issn=1362-9387}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Djerba]] took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by [[Al-Qaeda]]. 

In modern-day Tunisia, there have been many instances of antisemitic acts and statements. Since the government is not quick to condemn them, antisemitism spreads throughout Tunisian society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Israeli|first=Raphael|title=Anti-Semitism under the Guise of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Israelism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315124933-6|work=Muslim Anti-Semitism in Christian Europe|pages=149–189|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315124933|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Ben Ali regime, there have been an increasing number of public offenses against Jews in Tunisia. For example, in February 2012, when Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghanaim entered Tunisia, he was welcomed by Islamists who chanted "Death to the Jews" as a sign of their support. The following month, during protests in Tunis, a Salafi sheikh told young Tunisians to gather and learn to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the past, The Tunisian government has made efforts to block Jews from entering high positions, and some moderate members have tried to cover up the more extremist anti-Semitic efforts by appointing Jews to governmental positions, however, it is known that Muslim clerics believe that if the Muslim Brotherhood leads the regime, that will enhance their hatred towards Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to the prevalent anti-Semitism, the Tunisian government has publicly protected the dwindling population and its marks of Jewish culture, for example, synagogues, and advised them to settle in Djerba, a French tourist attraction.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/world/tunisian-synagogue-blast-called-accident.html|title=Tunisian Synagogue Blast Called Accident|last=Jr.|first=Donald G.

[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], former president of Iran, has frequently been accused of denying the Holocaust.

In July, the winner of Iran's first annual International [[Wall Street]] Downfall Cartoon Festival, jointly sponsored by the semi-state-run Iranian media outlet [[Fars News]], was an antisemitic cartoon depicting Jews praying before the [[New York Stock Exchange]], which is made to look like the [[Western Wall]]. Other cartoons in the contest were antisemitic as well. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, condemned the cartoon, stating that "Here's the anti-Semitic notion of Jews and their love for money, the canard that Jews 'control' Wall Street, and a cynical perversion of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism," and "Once again Iran takes the prize for promoting antisemitism."&lt;ref name="The Algemeiner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Wins Iranian Festival Prize|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/11/anti-semitic-cartoon-wins-iranian-festival-prize/|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Algemeiner|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jewish Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rocker|first=Simon|title=Iran gives antisemitic cartoon top prize|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/69827/iran-gives-antisemitic-cartoon-top-prize|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Declared Winner Of Iranian 'Wall Street Downfall' Festival|url=http://altwire.utne.com/zine/israel-palestine_new/antisemitic-cartoon-declared-winner-of-i/5547314632322f6f30586535547a61726a6e747545413d3d|website=The Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Japan}}
The Japanese first learned about antisemitism in 1918, during the cooperation of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] with the [[White movement]] in [[Siberia]]. [[White Army#Structure|White Army]] soldiers had been issued copies of ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', and "The ''Protocols'' continue to be used as evidence of Jewish conspiracies even though they are widely acknowledged to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8yetAgAAQBAJ Esther Webman, ''The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Century-Old Myth,'' Jewish Studies Series, Routledge, 2012.] {{ISBN|1136706100}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] encouraged Japan to adopt antisemitic policies. In the post-war period, [[Extremism|extremist groups]] and [[ideologues]] have promoted [[conspiracy theories]].

====Lebanon====
In 2004, [[Al-Manar]], a media network affiliated with [[Hezbollah]], aired a drama series, ''The Diaspora'', which observers allege is based on historical antisemitic allegations.

Although [[Malaysia]] presently has no substantial Jewish population, the country has reportedly become an example of a phenomenon called "antisemitism without Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Jonathan|title=Klezmer America : Jewishness, ethnicity, modernity|date=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14278-6|page=140|edition=1st}} Hyphenation added by Fulford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fulford|first1=Robert|title=Anti-Semitism without Jews in Malaysia|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/full-comment/blog.html?b=fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/10/06/robert-fulford-anti-semitism-without-jews-in-malaysia|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on Malay identity, "The Malay Dilemma," which was published in 1970, former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] wrote: "The Jews are not only hooked-nosed... but understand money instinctively.... Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them the economic control of Europe and provoked antisemitism which waxed and waned throughout Europe through the ages."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-abraham-cooper/malaysia-anti-semitism_b_903767.html In Malaysia, When in Doubt, Blame the Jews] by Rabbi Abraham Cooper, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay-language [[Utusan Malaysia]] daily stated in an editorial that Malaysians "cannot allow anyone, especially the Jews, to interfere secretly in this country's business... When the drums are pounded hard in the name of human rights, the pro-Jewish people will have their best opportunity to interfere in any Islamic country," the newspaper said. "We might not realize that the enthusiasm to support actions such as demonstrations will cause us to help foreign groups succeed in their mission of controlling this country." Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]]'s office subsequently issued a statement late Monday saying Utusan's claim did "not reflect the views of the government."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/malaysia-media-claims-jewish-plot-rally-062311621.html Malaysia media claims Jewish plot after rally] by Sean Yoong, ''[[Associated Press]]'' (republished in Yahoo.news), 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-an-opportunity-for-jews-to-infiltrate-country-says-utusan/ Bersih an opportunity for Jews to infiltrate country, says Utusan] by Shannon Teoh, ''Malaysia Insider'', 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/07/18/3088591/jews-trying-to-interfere-malaysian-newspaper-warns Jews trying to interfere, Malaysian newspaper warns], ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'', 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Gaza &amp; Palestinian Territories}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] is a central figure of [[Palestinian nationalism]] in Mandatory Palestine. He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},&lt;/ref&gt; while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469–470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Antébi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. … It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. … Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," to the extent that they are "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is "going on all the time" and that it is "worrying and disturbing." At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews."&lt;ref name="kuperwasser"&gt;{{cite news |title='Palestinian incitement continuing unabated'|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos]."

In 2004, the official Saudi Arabia tourism website said that Jews and holders of Israeli passports would not be issued visas to enter the country. After an uproar, the restriction against Jews was removed from the website although the ban against Israeli passport-holders remained.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3493448.stm "Jews barred in Saudi tourist drive"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 27 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2014, a Saudi newspaper reported that foreign workers of most religions, including Judaism, were welcome in the kingdom, but Israeli citizens were not.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Ben Solomon, [http://www.jpost.com/International/Saudi-Arabia-says-open-to-Jewish-workers-386239 "Saudi Arabia says open to Jewish Workers"], Jerusalem Post, 31 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Neve Shalom Synagogue]] was targeted in a car bombing, killing 21 Turkish Muslims and 6 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3276549.stm | work=BBC News | title=Film clue to Turkey Jewish attack | date=17 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the ''Economist'' suggested that "The best way for Turks to promote democracy would be to vote against the ruling party". Not long after, the Turkish Prime Minister, [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], said that "The International media, as they are supported by Israel, would not be happy with the continuation of the AKP government".&lt;ref name=cm&gt;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/06/07/turkey%E2%80%99s-prime-minister-the-jews-are-out-to-get-me/ Turkey's Prime Minister: The Jews Are Out to Get Me!], Commentary Magazine, 6 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hurriyet Daily News'' quoted Erdoğan at the time as claiming "The Economist is part of an Israeli conspiracy that aims to topple the Turkish government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=the-economist-faces-barrage-of-accusations-from-turkish-govt-2011-06-05 The Economist faces barrage of accusations from the Turkish gov't], The Hurriyet Daily News (English language edition), 12 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, during Erdogan's tenure, Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' has once again become a best selling book in Turkey.&lt;ref name=cm/&gt; Prime Minister Erdogan called antisemitism a "crime against humanity." He also said that "as a minority, they're our citizens. Both their security and the right to observe their faith are under our guarantee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=131576 |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | title=Erdogan vows to fight anti-Semitism in Turkey |date=2 March 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

{{Main|Antisemitism in Europe|New antisemitism}}
According to a 2004 report from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp" /&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817134910/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ |date=17 August 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm GENERAL ANALYSIS 2004], The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a "tsunami of antisemitism" was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable."&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey. [https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,2763,1676509,00.html "Chief rabbi fears 'tsunami' of hatred"], ''The Guardian'', 2 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|deadly shooting of three children]] at a Jewish school in France, the [[European Jewish Congress]] demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, "We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation. All these smaller attacks remind me of smaller tremors before a massive earthquake. The Jewish community cannot afford to be subject to an earthquake and the authorities cannot say that the writing was not on the wall." He added that European countries should take legislative efforts to ban any form of [[incitement]], as well as to equip the authorities with the necessary tools to confront any attempt to expand [[terrorist]] and violent activities against Jewish communities in Europe.&lt;ref name=EJP&gt;{{cite news|last=Shamee|first=Maureen|title='Proactive' response needed to escalation of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, says European Jewish Congress|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/uk/59964|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=European Jewish Press|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France is home to the continent's largest Jewish community (about 600,000).

Jewish philanthropist Baron [[Eric de Rothschild]] suggests that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated.

In March 2012, Mohammed Merah [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|opened fire at a Jewish school]] in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children. An 8-year-old girl was shot in the head at point blank range. President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said that it was "obvious" it was an antisemitic attack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=School Shooting Gun Same As Other Attacks|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16191704|newspaper=Sky News|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them.

4 months later, in July 2012, a French Jewish teenager wearing a "distinctive religious symbol" was the victim of a violent antisemitic attack on a train travelling between Toulouse and Lyon. The teen was first verbally harassed and later beaten up by two assailants. [[Richard Prasquier]] from the French Jewish umbrella group, [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], called the attack "another development in the worrying trend of anti-Semitism in our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack Read more: Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack|newspaper=[[Times of Israel]]|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident in July 2012 dealt with the vandalism of the synagogue of [[Noisy-le-Grand]] of the [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] district in [[Paris]]. The synagogue was vandalized three times in a ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L'Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and I think that we need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed."&lt;ref name=Algemeiner1&gt;{{cite news|title=French Synagogue Vandalized For Third Time in Ten Days|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/12/french-synagogue-vandalized-for-third-time-in-ten-days/|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=Algemeiner|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, [[Abraham Cooper]], the dean of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], met French Interior Minister [[Manuel Valls]] and reported that antisemitic attacks against French Jews increased by 40% since [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Merah's shooting spree]] in [[Toulouse]]. Cooper pressed Valls to take extra measures to secure the safety of French Jews, as well as to discuss strategies to foil an increasing trend of lone-wolf terrorists on the Internet.&lt;ref name="IHA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5606 | title=Anti-Semitic attacks in France surge by 40% since March | publisher=Israel Hayom | website=Reuters; Israel Hayom | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, two women were assaulted in Germany, sprayed with tear gas, and were shown a "[[Nazi salute|Hitler salute]]," apparently because of a [[Star of David]] necklace that they wore.&lt;ref name="Frauen im"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nordbayern.de/region/fuerth/frauen-im-freizeitbad-beleidigt-und-mit-reizgas-bespruht-1.2227517 | title=Frauen im Freizeitbad beleidigt und mit Reizgas besprüht | publisher=Nordbayern | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2012, [[Berlin]] police investigated an attack on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old daughter, allegedly by four Arab teens, after which the rabbi needed treatment for head wounds at a hospital. The police classified the attack as a hate crime. ''Jüdische Allgemeine'' reported that the rabbi was wearing a [[kippah]] and was approached by one of the teens, who asked the rabbi if he was Jewish. The teen then attacked the rabbi while yelling antisemitic comments, and threatened to kill the rabbi's daughter. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, saying that "Berlin is an international city in which intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are not being tolerated. Police will undertake all efforts to find and arrest the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="VoNG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vosizneias.com/112634/2012/08/29/germany-berlin-rabbi-and-his-six-year-old-daughter-become-victims-of-a-hate-crime/ | title=Germany – Berlin Rabbi And His Six-Year-Old Daughter Become Victims Of A Hate Crime | publisher=Vos Iz Neias | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, various historians, including Dr. Julius H. Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish historian and a member of the German Interior Ministry's commission to combat antisemitism, charged the majority of [[Bundestag]] deputies with failing to understand antisemitism and the imperativeness of periodic legislative reports on German antisemitism. Schoeps cited various antisemitic statements by German parliament members as well. The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse "latent anti-Semitism," but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=289609 | title=Historian slams Germany for ignoring anti-semitism | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=28 October 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2012 |author=Weinthal, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Greece}}

Antisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent [[Greek government-debt crisis]] has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].
Jews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 [[Sephardic Jews]] settled in [[Thessalonica]] after an invitation from the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. 
According to the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the "ADL Global 100", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that "Jews have too much power in the business world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Global 100: Greece|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece/2014|website=ADL Global 100|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published. Its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Versendaal|first1=Harry|title=Victimhood culture spawns Greek anti-Semitism, study finds|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/168389/article/ekathimerini/community/victimhood-culture-spawns-greek-anti-semitism-study-finds|accessdate=31 August 2015|work=ekathimerini|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jobbik-NewHungarianGuard-May2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Members of the New Hungarian Guard stand at a Jobbik rally against a gathering of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Budapest, 4 May 2013]]
In the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the "Jewish banker class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
{{Main|Antisemitism in 21st-century Italy}}

The ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of [[antisemitism in the 21st century]], and in Italy as well. The [[Second Intifada]], which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes.&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;{{cite web|title=Manifestations of anti-Semitism in the European Union|url=http://www.erinnern.at/bundeslaender/oesterreich/e_bibliothek/antisemitismus-1/431_anti-semitism_in_the_european_union.pdf|publisher=EUMC|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate of the peace process and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antisemitism Summary overview of the situation in the European Union 2001–2011|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/2215-FRA-2012-Antisemitism-update-2011_EN.pdf|publisher=FRA|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{Further|History of the Jews in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, it is difficult to obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. "Jew" or "Israel". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over CIDI (Dutch)|url=http://www.cidi.nl/over-cidi/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression.

According to the [[Anne Frank Foundation]], antisemitism in the Netherlands in 2011 was roughly at the same level as in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nieuwe rapportage – anne frank|url=http://m.annefrank.org/key/aWQ9MTUwMjQmbGM9bmw=|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual antisemitic incidents increased from 19 in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Verbal antisemitic incidents dropped slightly from 1173 in 2010 to 1098 in 2011. This accounts for 75%–80% of all verbal racist incidents in the Netherlands. Antisemitism is more prevalent in the age group 23–27 years, which is a younger group than that of racist incidents in general.

{{Main|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of [[Jew]]s", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students" and that "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]". Additionally, "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews", saying that it says in "the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010|access-date=5 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419230618/http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|archive-date=19 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What about Norwegian anti-Semitism?|url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/columns/what-about-norwegian-anti-semitism/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Foreigner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen referred to the antisemitism reported in this study as being "completely unacceptable."

In October 2012, the [[Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe]] issued a report regarding antisemitism in Norway, criticizing Norway for an increase in antisemitism in the country and blaming Norwegian officials for failing to address antisemitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/10/26/report-criticizes-norway-for-rise-in-anti-semitism/ | title=Report Criticizes Norway for Rise in Anti-Semitism | publisher=The Algemeiner | date=26 October 2012 | accessdate=28 October 2012 | author=Pontz, Zach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 2000s, levels of antisemitism in Russia have been low, and steadily decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regnum.ru/news/society/1895352.html В Москве представлен отчет об антисемитизме в 2014 году] Москва, 13 Февраля 2015, 21:46 — REGNUM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=feor&gt;[http://ria.ru/interview/20141107/1032029411.html Президент ФЕОР: Россия — "остров спокойствия" на фоне Западной Европы] 11:0007.11.2014 (обновлено: 11:42 07.11.2014)&lt;/ref&gt; President of the [[Russian Jewish Congress]] attributes this in part to the vanished state sponsorship of antisemitism. At the same time experts warn that worsening economic conditions may lead to the surge of [[xenophobia]] and antisemitism in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2016/11/01/663147-evreiskii-vopros-utratil-ostrotu "«Еврейский вопрос» в России утратил прежнюю остроту"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, since the mid-2000s incorporation of antisemitic discourse into the platforms and speeches of nationalist political movements in Russia has been reported by [[human rights]] monitors in Russia as well as in the press.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} A number of prominent modern Russian politicians are known for their  antisemitic views.

After Germany and Austria, Sweden has the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe, though the Netherlands has reported a higher rate of antisemitism in some years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: "The Jews have too much influence in the world today".&lt;ref name="GovStudy"&gt;Henrik Bachner and Jonas Ring.{{cite web|url=http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf |title=Antisemitic images and attitudes in Sweden |accessdate=21 February 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221140257/http://intolerans.levandehistoria.se/article/article_docs/antisemitism_english.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 |df=dmy }} . levandehistoria.se&lt;/ref&gt; 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims "harbour systematic antisemitic views".&lt;ref name="GovStudy"/&gt; The former prime minister [[Göran Persson]] described these results as "surprising and terrifying". However, the rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said that "It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] to be."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/922248.html Anti-Semitism, in Sweden?

In 2009, a synagogue that served the Jewish community in Malmö was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused while returning home from prayer, and masked men mockingly chanted "Hitler" in the streets.

In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change."&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"/&gt;

Every year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by [[YouGov]] concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, far-left antisemitism and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that "until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. The inquiry was reconstituted following a surge in antisemitic incidents in Britain during the summer of 2014, and the new inquiry published its report in 2015, making recommendations for reducing antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129862/key-recommendations-include-call-police-and-council-involvement|title=Key recommendations include call for police and council involvement|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although antisemitism in Canada is less prevalent than in many other countries, there have been recent incidents. For example, a 2004 study identified 24 incidents of antisemitism between 14 March and 14 July 2004 in Newfoundland, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and some smaller Ontario communities. The incidents included vandalism and other attacks on four synagogues, six cemeteries, four schools, and a number of businesses and private residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-prutschi-f04.htm|title=Anti-Semitism in Canada  - Manuel Prutschi|website=www.jcpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of ''Title VI'' of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and further recommended that [[United States Congress|Congress]] clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusccr.com/Ending%20Campus%20Ant-Semitism1.htm Ending Campus Anti-Semitism].

On 19 September 2006, [[Yale University]] founded the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]] (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director [[Charles A. Small|Charles Small]] of the Center cited the increase in antisemitism worldwide in recent years as generating a "need to understand the current manifestation of this disease".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study antisemitism] Associated Press, 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Yale voted to close this initiative. After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. [[Donald Green]], then head of Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students. As with other programs that had been in a similar situation, the initiative had therefore been cancelled.&lt;ref name=nhregister201106&gt;{{Cite news | author = Mary E.

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, "with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views." The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] and 32% of [[African American|African-Americans]] hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America].

A 2009 study published in ''[[Boston Review]]'' found that nearly 25% of non-Jewish Americans blamed Jews for the [[financial crisis of 2008–2009]], with a higher percentage among Democrats than Republicans. 32% of Democrats blamed Jews for the financial crisis, versus 18% for Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Malhotra and Yotam Margalit.

In August 2012, the [[California state assembly]] approved a [[non-binding resolution]] that "encourages university leaders to combat a wide array of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel actions," although the resolution "is purely symbolic and does not carry policy implications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/calif-resolution-denouncing-anti-semitism-on-college-campuses-targets-anti-israel-protests/2012/08/29/17a0188a-f1b2-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html|title=Calif. resolution denouncing anti-Semitism on college campuses targets anti-Israel protests|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[Politico|Politico Magazine]]'' published an article purporting to show links between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Jewish outreach organization [[Chabad-Lubavitch]]. The article was widely condemned, with the head of the Anti-Defamation League [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] saying that it "evokes age-old myths about Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zalman|first1=Jonathan|title=Politico’s Dubious Chabad Story Receives Widespread Criticism|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/229930/politicos-dubious-chabad-story-receives-widespread-criticism|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=Tablet Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politico goes full ‘Elders of Zion,’ silenced by the college mob &amp; other comments|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/10/politico-goes-full-elders-of-zion-silenced-by-the-college-mob-other-comments/|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, stated in an interview, “While anti-Semitic attitudes have remained consistent at 14%... anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise. In 2016 we saw a 34% increase over the prior year in acts of harassment, vandalism, or violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions. During the first three quarters of 2017, there was a 67% increase over the same period in 2016. We’ve seen double the number of incidents in K-12 schools, and almost a 60% increase on college campuses." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reformjudaism.org/blog/2017/11/27/we-cant-just-rely-old-tactics|title=We Can't Just Rely on the Old Tactics|website=ReformJudaism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nobel Peace Prize==
On 10 December 1989 the Dalai Lama was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1989/presentation-speech.html |title=Presentation Speech by Egil Aarvik, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee recognized his efforts in "the struggle of the liberation of Tibet and the efforts for a peaceful resolution instead of using violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize |work=Dalai Lama (Tenzin Gyatso) |url=http://www.nobelpreis.org/english/frieden/dalai-lama.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kNENczrF?url=http://www.nobelpreis.org/english/frieden/dalai-lama.html |archivedate=2009-10-08 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=6 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the Nobel committee said that the award was "in part a tribute to the memory of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]."
In his acceptance speech the Dalai Lama criticised China for using force against student protesters during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. He said the victims' efforts were not in vain. His speech focused on the importance of the continued use of non-violence and his desire to maintain a dialogue with China to try to resolve the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Government of Tibet in Exile |work=His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Nobel Prize acceptance speech University Aula, Oslo, 10 December 1989 |url=http://www.tibet.com/DL/nobelaccept.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712113020/http://www.tibet.com/DL/nobelaccept.html |archivedate=2009-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legislature}}

A '''bicameral''' [[legislature]] divides the legislators into two separate [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], chambers, or houses. '''Bicameralism''' is distinguished from [[unicameralism]], in which all members deliberate and vote as a single group, and from some legislatures that have three or more separate assemblies, chambers, or houses. {{as of|2015}}, fewer than half the world's national legislatures are bicameral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IPU PARLINE database: Structure of parliaments|url = http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/ParliamentsStructure.asp?REGION=All&amp;LANG=ENG|website = www.ipu.org|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the members of the two chambers are elected or selected by different methods, which vary from country to country. This can often lead to the two chambers having very different compositions of members.

[[Enactment of a bill|Enactment]] of [[primary legislation]] often requires a [[concurrent majority]] – the approval of a majority of members in each of the chambers of the legislature. When this is the case, the legislature may be called an example of '''perfect bicameralism.''' However, in many [[Westminster system]] parliaments, the house to which the executive is [[Responsible government|responsible]] can overrule the other house and may be regarded as an example of '''imperfect bicameralism'''. Some legislatures lie in between these two positions, with one house only able to overrule the other under certain circumstances.

==History of bicameral legislatures==
[[File:Casas del Parlamento. Palacio de Westminster - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Westminster]], seat of the UK Parliament]]
[[File:12-07-13-washington-by-RalfR-10.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Capitol]], seat of Congress]]

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] favoured a bicameral legislature. The idea was to have the Senate be wealthier and wiser. Benjamin Rush saw this though, and noted that "this type of dominion is almost always connected with opulence". The Senate was created to be a stabilising force, elected not by mass electors, but selected by the State legislators. Senators would be more knowledgeable and more deliberate—a sort of republican nobility—and a counter to what [[James Madison|Madison]] saw as the "fickleness and passion" that could absorb the House.&lt;ref name="HG1"&gt;[http://archives.democrats.rules.house.gov/Archives/jcoc2br.htm The Constitutional Background - House of Representatives archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

He noted further that "The use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with more coolness, with more system and with more wisdom, than the popular branch." Madison's argument led the Framers to grant the Senate prerogatives in foreign policy, an area where steadiness, discretion, and caution were deemed especially important.&lt;ref name="HG1"/&gt; State legislators chose the Senate, and senators had to possess significant property to be deemed worthy and sensible enough for the position. In 1913, the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment]] passed, which mandated choosing Senators by popular vote rather than State legislatures.&lt;ref name="HG1"/&gt;

As part of the [[Great Compromise]], they{{who|date=November 2018}} invented a new rationale for bicameralism in which the Senate had states represented equally, and the House had them represented by population.

The British Parliament is often referred to as the ''[[Mother of Parliaments]]'' (in fact a misquotation of [[John Bright]], who remarked in 1865 that "England is the Mother of Parliaments") because the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its [[Act of Parliament|Act]]s have created many other parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seidle|first1=F. Leslie|last2=Docherty|first2=David C.|title=Reforming parliamentary democracy|date=2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=9780773525085|page=3|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i6je60BF-3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British "three-tier" model. Most countries in Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial [[head of state]] who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house, and a smaller upper house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004151745|pages=92–94|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Westminster Parliamentary System was exported around the World|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for bicameralism and criticism==
{{Quote|text=A formidable sinister interest may always obtain the complete command of a dominant assembly by some chance and for a moment, and it is therefore of great use to have a second chamber of an opposite sort, differently composed, in which that interest in all likelihood will not rule.|author=[[Walter Bagehot]]|source="The English Constitution", in Norman St John-Stevas, ed., ''The Collected Works of Walter Bagehot'', London, The Economist, vol. 5, pp. 273–274.}}

There have been a number of rationales put forward in favour of bicameralism, federal states have often adopted it, and the solution remains popular when regional differences or sensitivities require more explicit representation, with the second chamber representing the constituent states. Nevertheless, the older justification for second chambers—providing opportunities for second thoughts about legislation—has survived.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Growing awareness of the complexity of the notion of representation and the multifunctional nature of modern legislatures may be affording incipient new rationales for second chambers, though these do generally remain contested institutions in ways that first chambers are not. An example of political controversy regarding a second chamber has been the debate over the powers of the [[Senate of Canada]] or the election of the [[Senate of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/010132156-senat-le-triomphe-de-l-anomalie Liberation.fr], Sénat, le triomphe de l'anomalie&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the two chambers varies; in some cases, they have equal power, while in others, one chamber is clearly superior in its powers. The first tends to be the case in federal systems and those with presidential governments. The latter tends to be the case in unitary states with [[parliamentary system]]s.

There are two streams of thought: Critics believe bicameralism makes meaningful political reforms more difficult to achieve and increases the risk of gridlock—particularly in cases where both chambers have similar powers—while proponents argue the merits of the "[[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]]" provided by the bicameral model, which they believe help prevent the passage into law of ill-considered legislation.

==Communication between houses==
Formal communication between houses is by various methods, including:&lt;ref name="Odgers"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_21#h02 |chapter=Chapter 21: Relations with the House of Representatives  |publisher=Parliament of Australia |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice |edition=14th |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sending messages: Formal notices, such as of [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s or the passing of bills, usually done in writing, via the [[Clerk (legislature)|clerk]] and [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of each house
;Transmission: of bills or amendment to bills requiring agreement from the other house
;[[Joint session]]: a [[plenary session]] of both houses at the same time and place.
;[[Joint committee]]s: which may be formed by committees of each house agreeing to join, or by joint resolution of each house
;Conferences:Conferences of the Houses of the English (later British) Parliament met in the [[Painted Chamber]] of the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="Jones2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Clyve|year=2014|title=Accommodation in the Painted Chamber for Conferences between the Lords and the Commons from 1600 to 1834|journal=Parliamentary History|volume=33|issue=2|pages=342–357|issn=0264-2824|doi=10.1111/1750-0206.12100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically there were a distinction between an "ordinary conference" and a "free conference"; an ordinary conference in the British Parliament was last held in 1860 as the elaborate procedure was replaced by the simpler sending of messages. A "free conference" meets in private to resolve a dispute; it is organised by managers appointed by each house who report back to it. The last free conference at Westminster was in 1836 on an amendment to the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]];&lt;ref&gt;Blayden 2017 p.6; {{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1836/aug/11/free-conference-municipal-corporations|title=Free Conference—Municipal Corporations' Act Amendment (, )|date=11 August 1836|work=Hansard|pages=HC Deb vol 35 cc1125–7 |nopp=Y|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the previous one was in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Blayden 2017 p.6; {{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol25/pp518-526|title=Managers for the Free Conference, on the Bill to prevent Commerce with Spain.|date=22–24 April 1740|work=House of Lords Journal|publisher=British History Online|pages=Volume 25, pp.518–526 |nopp=Y |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Parliament of Australia]] there have been two formal conferences, in 1930 and 1931, but many informal conferences.&lt;ref name="Odgers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlaydenPLPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aspg.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/BlaydenPLPP-Research-Essay-Free-Conferences-in-New-South-Wales.pdf|title=Do free conferences have a place in the present-day NSW Parliament?|last=Blayden|first=Lynsey|date=September 2017|publisher=Australasian Study of Parliament Group|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007}} the "Conference of Managers" remains the usual procedure for dispute resolution in the [[Parliament of South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crump|first=Rick|date=Spring 2007|title=Why the conference procedure remains the preferred method for resolving disputes between the two houses of the South Australian Parliament|journal=Australasian Parliamentary Review|volume=22|issue=2|pages=120–136 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.611.7131&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] in 2011, the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] requested a free conference with the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] over a bill on graffiti; after a year the Council refused, describing the mechanism as archaic and inappropriate.&lt;ref name="BlaydenPLPP"/&gt; The [[United States Congress]] has [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]]s to resolve discrepancies between House and Senate versions of a bill. The number of conference reports produced by such committees fell from 67 in the [[104th Congress]] (1995–96) to 3 in the [[113th Congress]] (2013–14).

==Types==

===Federal===
Some countries, such as [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Pakistan]], [[Russia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Nigeria]], and the [[United States]], link their bicameral systems to their [[federation|federal]] political structure.

In the United States, Australia, and Mexico, for example, each state is given the same number of seats in one of the houses of the legislature, despite variance in the population of each state — it is designed to ensure that smaller states are not overshadowed by larger states, which may have more representation in the other house of the legislature.

====Canada====
[[File:Mosaika display, Centre Block, Parliament Hill.jpeg|right|thumb|The federal bicameral [[Parliament of Canada]], which contains a [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] and a [[Senate of Canada|Senate]]]]
In Canada, the country as a whole is divided into a number of [[Canadian Senate Divisions|Senate Divisions]], each with a different number of Senators, based on a number of factors. These Divisions are [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], [[Western Canada|Western Provinces]], and [[the Maritimes]], each with 24 Senators, [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], each with 1 Senator, and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] has 6 Senators, making for a total of 105 Senators.

Senators in Canada are not elected by the people but are appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]. The Senate does not originate most legislation (although a small fraction of government bills are introduced in the Senate and Senators may introduce [[private members' bills]] in the same way as MPs) but acts as a chamber of revision almost always passing legislation approved by the House of Commons, made up of Members of Parliament (MPs) who are elected. The Senate must pass legislation before it becomes law and can therefore act as a wise facilitator or engage in filibuster. The Senate does not have to endure the accountability and scrutiny of parliamentary elections. Therefore, the bicameral structure of Canadian parliament is more ''[[de jure]]'' than ''[[de facto]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

====Australia====
[[File:Parliament House - panoramio (7).jpg|right|thumb|The federal bicameral [[Parliament of Australia]], which contains a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a [[Australian Senate|Senate]]]]
The bicameral [[Parliament of Australia]] consists of two Houses, the [[lower house]] is called the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[upper house]] is named the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. The lower house currently consists of 150 members, each elected from single member constituencies, known as [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|electoral divisions]] (commonly referred to as "electorates" or "seats") using full-preference [[Instant-runoff voting]]. This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House to gain and hold power.

The upper house, the Senate, is also popularly elected under the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]]. There are a total of 76 senators: 12 senators are elected from each of the six [[Australian state]]s (regardless of population) and two from each of the two autonomous internal territories (the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]).

Unlike upper houses in most [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary systems]], the Australian Senate is vested with significant power, including the capacity to block legislation initiated by the government in the House of Representatives, making it a distinctive hybrid of British [[Westminster system|Westminster bicameralism]] and US-style bicameralism. As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition, which must maintain the confidence of the lower house, rarely has a majority in the Senate and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and Independents to get legislation passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/pops/pop34 |title=Papers on Parliament No. 34 Representation and Institutional Change: 50 Years of Proportional Representation in the Senate |date=1999 |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German, Indian, and Pakistani systems, the upper houses (the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the [[Rajya Sabha]], and the [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] respectively) are even more closely linked with the federal system, being appointed or elected directly by the governments or legislatures of each [[States of Germany|German]] or [[States and territories of India|Indian state]], or [[Provinces of Pakistan|Pakistani province]]. This was also the case in the United States before the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] was adopted. Because of this coupling to the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], German legal doctrine does not treat the ''Bundesrat'' as the second chamber of a bicameral system formally. Rather, it sees the ''Bundesrat'' and the ''[[Bundestag]]'' as independent constitutional bodies. Only the directly elected ''Bundestag'' is considered the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'', BVerfGE 37, 363, Aktenzeichen 2 BvF 2, 3/73&lt;/ref&gt; In the German [[Bundesrat of Germany|''Bundesrat'']], the various ''Länder'' have between three and six votes; thus, while the less populated states have a lower weight, they still have a stronger voting power than would be the case in a system based ''purely'' on population, as the [[North Rhine-Westphalia|most populous ''Land'']] currently has about 27 times the population of the [[Bremen (state)|least populous]]. The Indian Upper House does not have the states represented equally, but on the basis of their population.

There is also bicameralism in countries that are not federations, but have upper houses with representation on a territorial basis. For example, in South Africa, the [[National Council of Provinces]] (and before 1997, the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]]) has its members chosen by each [[Provinces of South Africa|Province]]'s legislature.

In Spain the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] functions as a ''de facto'' territorial-based upper house, and there has been some pressure from the [[Autonomous Communities]] to reform it into a strictly territorial chamber.

The [[European Union]] maintains a bicameral legislative system consisting of the [[European Parliament]], which is elected in elections on the basis of universal suffrage, and the [[Council of the European Union]], which consists of one representative for each Government of member countries, who are competent for a relevant field of legislation. The European Union is not considered a country nor a state, but it enjoys the power to address national Governments in many areas.

===Aristocratic and post-aristocratic===
In a few countries, bicameralism involves the juxtaposition of democratic and aristocratic elements.

The best known example is the British [[House of Lords]], which includes a number of [[hereditary peer]]s. The House of Lords is a vestige of the aristocratic system that once predominated in British politics, while the other house, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], is entirely elected. Over the years, some have proposed reforms to the House of Lords, some of which have been at least partly successful. The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] limited the number of hereditary peers (as opposed to [[life peer]]s, appointed by the [[British monarchy|Monarch]] on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) to 92, down from around 700. Of these 92, one is the [[Earl Marshal]], a hereditary office always held by the [[Duke of Norfolk]], one is the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], a hereditary office held by turns, currently by the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley]], and the other 90 are [[Representative peer|elected by all sitting peers]]. Hereditary peers elected by the House to sit as representative peers sit for life; when a representative peer dies, byelections occur to fill the vacancy. The ability of the House of Lords to block legislation is curtailed by the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. Peers can introduce bills except Money Bills, and all legislation must be passed by both [[Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons|Houses of Parliament]]. If not passed within two sessions, the [[House of Commons]] can override the Lords delay by invoking the Parliament Act. Certain legislation, however, must be approved by both Houses and can't be forced through by the Commons under the Parliament Act. These include any bill that would extend the time length of a Parliament, private bills, bills sent to the House of Lords less than one month before the end of a session, and bills that originated in the House of Lords.

Life Peers are appointed either by recommendation of the Appointment Commission; the independent body that vets non-partisan peers, typically from academia, business or culture, or by Dissolution Honour, which takes place at the end of every Parliamentary term and leaving MPs may be offered a seat to keep their institutional memory. It is traditional to offer a peerage to every outgoing Speaker of the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-appointment/ How do you become a Member of the House of Lords? - UK Parliament]. Parliament.uk (21 April 2010). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further reform of the Lords has been proposed; however, reform is not supported by many. Members of the House of Lords all have an aristocratic title, or are from the [[Lord Spiritual|Clergy]]. 26 Archbishops and Bishops of the [[Church of England]] sit as [[Lord Spiritual|Lords Spiritual]], being the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Archbishop of York]], the [[Bishop of London]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and the next 21 longest-serving Bishops. It is usual that retiring Archbishops, and certain other Bishops, are appointed to the [[Crossbencher|Crossbenches]] and given a life peerage. Until 2009, 12 [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] sat in the House as the highest court in the land; they subsequently became justices of the newly created [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]. At present, 786 people sit in the House of Lords, with 92 Hereditary, 26 being Bishops or Archbishops (the Lords Spiritual) and the rest being Life Peers. Membership is not fixed and decreases only on the death of a life peer.

Another example of aristocratic bicameralism was the Japanese [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]], abolished after [[World War II]] and replaced with the present [[House of Councillors]].

===Unitary states===

 | footer=Some bicameral legislatures have chambers that meet on different buildings, at different parts of the city. Here, France's upper house called the [[Senate of France|Senate]] meet in the [[Luxembourg Palace]] (top), while the lower house, the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]], meets at the [[Palais Bourbon]] (bottom).
 }}
Many bicameral countries like the [[Netherlands]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Romania]] are examples of bicameral systems existing in [[unitary state]]s. In countries such as these, the upper house generally focuses on scrutinizing and possibly vetoing the decisions of the lower house.

On the other hand, in [[Italy]] the [[Italian Parliament|Parliament]] consists of two chambers that have the same role and power: the [[Italian Senate|Senate]] (Senate of the Republic, commonly considered the ''upper house'') and the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] (considered the ''lower house'').

In some of these countries, the upper house is indirectly elected. Members of France's [[French Senate|Senate]] and Ireland's [[Seanad Éireann]] are chosen by [[electoral college]]s, the latter's consisting of members of the lower house, local councillors, the [[Taoiseach]], and graduates of selected universities, while the Netherlands' [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] is chosen by members of provincial assemblies (which, in turn, are directly elected).

[[Norway]] had a kind of [[Storting#Qualified unicameralism (1814–2009)|semi-bicameral legislature]] with two chambers, or departments, within the same elected body, the [[Storting]]. These were called the Odelsting and were abolished after the general election of 2009. According to Morten Søberg, there was a related system in the 1798 constitution of the [[Batavian Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.as/?vis=artikkel&amp;fid=3018&amp;id=0604200909214912460&amp;magasin=ja&amp;t=Senatet-som-aldri-vart Minerva.as]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]], members of the unicameral [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] returned from the democratically elected geographical constituencies and partially-democratic [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]] are required to vote separately since 1997 on motions, bills or amendments to government bills not introduced by the government. The passage of these motions, bills or amendments to government bills requires double majority in both groups simultaneously. (Before 2004, when elections to the Legislative Council from the [[Election Committee]] was abolished, members returned through the Election Committee vote with members returned from geographical constituencies.) The double majority requirement does not apply to motions, bills and amendments introduced by the [[Hong Kong Government|government]].

==Subnational entities==
In some countries with federal systems, individual states (like those of the United States, [[States and territories of Australia|Australia]] and a few [[States of India]]) may also have bicameral legislatures. A few such states as [[Nebraska]] in the U.S., [[Queensland]] in Australia, [[Bavaria]] in Germany, and [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] and [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] in Argentina have later adopted unicameral systems. Brazilian states and Canadian provinces had all their upper houses abolished.

===Argentina===
[[File:Legislaturas provinciales de Argentina.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Provincial legislatures of Argentina.]]
In [[Argentina]], eight [[Provinces of Argentina|provinces]] have bicameral legislatures, with a [[Senate]] and a [[Chamber of Deputies]]: [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] (since 1987) and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] and [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] changed to [[unicameral]] systems in 1990 and 2001 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Malamud, Andrés and Martín Costanzo (2010) "[http://repositorio.ul.pt/handle/10451/11915 Bicameralismo subnacional: el caso argentino en perspectiva comparada]". In: Igor Vivero Ávila (ed.), Democracia y reformas políticas en México y América Latina (pp. 219-246). Mexico: M. A. Porrúa.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In Australian states, the lower house was traditionally elected based on the one-vote-one-value principle, whereas the upper house was partially appointed and elected, with a bias towards country voters and landowners. In Queensland, the appointed [[Queensland Legislative Council|upper house]] was abolished in 1922, while in [[New South Wales]] there were similar attempts at abolition, before the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|upper house]] was reformed in the 1970s to provide for direct election. Nowadays, the upper house both federally and in most states is elected using the [[Single transferable vote]] form of [[proportional representation]] while the lower house uses [[Instant-runoff voting]] in single member electorates. This is reversed in the state of [[Tasmania]], where proportional representation is used for the [[Tasmania House of Assembly|lower house]] and single member electorates for the [[Tasmania Legislative Council|upper house]].

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The Legislature of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], one of the two entities of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], is a bicameral legislative body. It consists of two chambers. 
The House of Representatives has 98 delegates, elected for four-year terms by proportional representation.
The House of Peoples has 58 members, 17 delegates from among each of the constituent peoples of the Federation, and 7 delegates from among the other peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advokat-prnjavorac.com/legislation/constitution_fbih.pdf Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republika Srpska]], the other entity, has a unicameral parliament, known as the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narodnaskupstinars.net/?q=en/national-assembly/about-national-assembly The National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The German federal state of [[Bavaria]] had a bicameral legislature from 1946 to 1999, when the [[Senate of Bavaria|Senate]] was abolished by a referendum amending the state's constitution. The other 15 states have used a unicameral system since their founding.

===India===
Seven Indian States, [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], have bicameral Legislatures, in these states the upper house is called [[Vidhan Parishad]] (Legislative Councils), one third of whom members are elected every two years. Among the members of legislative councils:

*One third are elected by the members of local bodies in the state such as [[Municipal governance in India|municipalities]], [[Gram panchayat|gram sabhas/gram panchayats]], [[Panchayat samiti (block)|panchayat samitis]] and the [[District Councils of India|district councils of India]].
*One third are elected by  the members of Legislative Assemblies of the State from among the persons who are not members of the Assembly.
*One sixth are nominated by the [[Governor (India)|governor]] of the state from persons having knowledge or practical experience in fields such as [[literature]], [[science]], [[arts]], the [[Cooperative|co-operative]] movement and [[Social work|social service]].
*One twelfth are elected by persons who are graduates of three years' standing residing in that state.
*One twelfth are elected by persons engaged for at least three years in teaching in [[Education in India|educational institutions within the state]] not lower than [[secondary school]]s, including [[college]]s and [[University|universities]].

From 1956 to 1958 the Andhra Pradesh Legislature was unicameral. In 1958, when the Legislative Council was formed, it became bicameral until 1 June 1985 when it was abolished. This continued until March 2007 when the Legislative Council was reestablished and elections were held for its seats. Since then the Andhra Pradesh Legislature has become once again bicameral. 
In [[Tamil Nadu]], a resolution was passed on 14 May 1986 and the Legislative Council was dissolved on 1 November 1986. Again on 12 April 2010, a resolution was passed to bring it back bicameral, but became unsuccessful in 2011. Similarly the states of [[Assam]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[West Bengal]] have also dissolved the upper house of their state legislature.

===Russia===
Under [[Soviet regime]] regional and local [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] were unicameral. After the adoption of [[Constitution of Russia|1993 Russian Constitution]] bicameralism was introduced in some regions. Bicameral regional legislatures are still technically allowed by federal law but this clause is dormant now. The last region to switch from bicameralism to unicameralism was [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] in 2012.

===United States===
During the 1930s, the Legislature of the State of Nebraska was reduced from [[bicameral]] to unicameral with the 43 members that once comprised that state's Senate. One of the arguments used to sell the idea at the time to Nebraska voters was that by adopting a unicameral system, the perceived evils of the "[[conference committee]]" process would be eliminated.

A conference committee is appointed when the two chambers cannot agree on the same wording of a proposal, and consists of a small number of legislators from each chamber. This tends to place much power in the hands of only a small number of legislators. Whatever legislation, if any, the conference committee finalizes must then be approved in an unamendable "take-it-or-leave-it" manner by both chambers.

During his term as [[Governor]] of the State of [[Minnesota]], [[Jesse Ventura]] proposed converting the Minnesotan legislature to a single chamber with [[proportional representation]], as a reform that he felt would solve many legislative difficulties and impinge upon legislative corruption. In his book on political issues, ''Do I Stand Alone?'', Ventura argued that bicameral legislatures for provincial and local areas were excessive and unnecessary, and discussed unicameralism as a reform that could address many legislative and budgetary problems for states.

==Reform==

===Arab political reform===
A 2005 report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/pdf/Arab_Democracy_TF.pdf 2005 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705153315/http://www.cfr.org/pdf/Arab_Democracy_TF.pdf |date=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on democratic reform in the Arab world by the U.S. [[Council on Foreign Relations]] co-sponsored by former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] urged Arab states to adopt bicameralism, with upper chambers appointed on a 'specialized basis'. The Council claimed that this would protect against the '[[Tyranny of the majority]]', expressing concerns that without a system of checks and balances extremists would use the single chamber parliaments to restrict the rights of [[minority group|minority]] groups.

In 2002, [[Bahrain]] adopted a bicameral system with an elected lower chamber and an appointed upper house. This led to a boycott of parliamentary elections that year by the [[Al Wefaq]] party, who said that the government would use the upper house to veto their plans. Many secular critics of bicameralism were won around to its benefits in 2005, after many MPs in the lower house voted for the introduction of so-called [[morality police]].

===Romania===
A [[Romanian parliamentary reform referendum, 2009|referendum]] on introducing a unicameral Parliament instead of the current bicameral [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] was held in [[Romania]] on 22 November 2009. The turnout rate was 50.95%, with 77.78% of "Yes" votes for a unicameral Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-ro.info/referendum-turnout-5095-7778-said-yes-for-a-unicameral-parliament-8884-voted-for-the-decrease-in-the-number-of-parliamentarians.html Referendum turnout 50.95%. 77.78 said YES for a unicameral Parliament, 88.84% voted for the decrease in the number of Parliamentarians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231024/http://www.news-ro.info/referendum-turnout-5095-7778-said-yes-for-a-unicameral-parliament-8884-voted-for-the-decrease-in-the-number-of-parliamentarians.html |date=21 July 2011 }}, Official results from the Romanian Central Electoral Commission&lt;/ref&gt; This referendum had a consultative role, thus requiring a parliamentary initiative and another referendum to ratify the new proposed changes.

===Ivory Coast===
A [[Ivorian constitutional referendum, 2016|referendum]] on a new [[Constitution of Ivory Coast#2016 Constitution (proposed)|constitution]] was held on 30 October 2016. The constitution draft would create a bicameral [[Parliament of Ivory Coast|Parliament]] instead of the current unicameral. The [[Senate (Ivory Coast)|Senate]] is expected to represent the interests of territorial collectivities and Ivoirians living abroad. Two thirds of the Senate is to be elected at the same time as the general election. The remaining one third is appointed by the president elect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionnet.org/news/innovations-draft-constitution-cote-divoire-towards-hyper-presidentialism|title=Innovations of the Draft Constitution of Cote d’Ivoire: Towards hyper-presidentialism?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blancs d'Espagne''' ("Spanish Whites") was a term used to refer to those [[legitimism|legitimist]]s in France who, following the death of the [[Comte de Chambord]] in 1883, supported the Spanish [[Carlism|Carlist]] claimant rather than the [[House of Orléans|Orleanist]] candidate, who was supported by the vast majority of French royalists.

The term was generally used by supporters of the [[Philippe, Comte de Paris|Comte de Paris]], the Orleanist candidate, as a term of derision for their ultra-legitimist opponents who so hated the House of Orléans that they would support a foreign prince over an Orleanist candidate.

It is a pun on the cosmetic and cleanser known as ''blanc d'Espagne'', originally a [[white lead]] pigment and later either basic [[bismuth nitrate]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Gmelin]], [[Henry Watts (chemist)|Henry Watts]]. ''Handbook of Chemistry.'' Cavendish Society, London, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt; or a preparation made from [[chalk]] and clay.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Nouveau Petit Robert: Dictionnaire de la langue française.'' Dictionnaires le Robert, Paris, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">"'''Boris, you are wrong'''" ({{lang-ru|Борис, ты не прав}}) is a political [[catchphrase]], originally said by [[Yegor Ligachev]] to [[Boris Yeltsin]] on 1 July 1988 to tackle Yeltsin's split from Soviet politics. Ligachev was at the time a member of the [[Politburo]], while Yeltsin was First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet [[State Committee for Construction]]. Speaking at the 19th All-Union Conference of the [[CPSU]], Ligachev said: "Dear comrades! We should not be silent because communist Yeltsin has chosen a wrong path. It turned out that the man does not have a creative, but a destructive force. His assessment of the ''[[perestroyka]]'' process, the approach and the method of work have been declared untenable and erroneous in the party. There are reasonable proposals in his speech, but in general it indicates that you, Boris, have not drawn the correct political conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hY28PXvHaE| title =Video of Yegor Ligachev's speech|language=Russian|publisher =[[YouTube]]| accessdate =20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form "Boris, you are wrong" was popularized by [[Gennady Khazanov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://pda.mn.ru/opinions/20130701/350508736.html| archive-url =https://archive.is/20140220005412/http://pda.mn.ru/opinions/20130701/350508736.html| dead-url =yes| archive-date =20 February 2014| title =Ощущение цитаты| publisher =''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]''| language =Russian| accessdate =20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase did not appear in the published protocol of the conference, but within days after that event people in Moscow started to wear lapel buttons saying, "Yegor, you are wrong!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =O'Clery | first =Conor | title =Moscow, December 25, 1991: The Last Day of the Soviet Union| publisher =PublicAffairs | year =2011 | page =65 | isbn =1610390121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been used in later Russian publications to admonish or rebuke the opposing side in the form "''N,'' you are wrong". Following Yeltsin's death in 2007, Ligachev upheld his criticism by saying that what he told Yeltsin back then was right in his opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://politsovet.ru/18209-.html| title =Егор Лигачев: Говоря: "Борис, ты не прав!", я не ошибся |publisher =Politsovet.ru|language=Russian| accessdate =20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligachev's own 2012 memoir book is titled ''Boris Was Wrong'' ({{ISBN|978-5-4438-0089-9}}).

The '''Burmese Way to Socialism''' ({{lang-my|မြန်မာ့နည်းမြန်မာ့ဟန် ဆိုရှယ်လစ်စနစ်}}; also known as the ''Burmese Road to Socialism'') refers to the [[ideology]] of the [[Socialist state|socialist government]] in [[Burma]], from 1962 to 1988, when the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|1962 coup d'état]] was led by [[Ne Win]] and the [[Burmese military|military]] to remove [[U Nu]] from power. More specifically, the ''Burmese Way to Socialism'' is an economic treatise written in April 1962 by the [[Union Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]], shortly after the coup, as a blueprint for [[economic development]], [[Isolationism|reducing foreign influence in Burma]] and [[Militarism|increasing the role of the military]].&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Robert A. |year=1967 |title=Burmese Domestic Policy: The Politics of Burmanization |journal=Asian Survey |publisher=University of California Press |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=188–197 |jstor=2642237 |doi=10.1525/as.1967.7.3.01p0257y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military coup led by Ne Win and the [[Union Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]] (RC) in 1962 was done under the pretext of economic, religious and political crises in the country, particularly the issue of [[federalism]] and the right of [[States of Burma|Burmese states]] to secede from the [[Government of Burma|Union]].&lt;ref name="aungthwin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aung-Thwin |first1=Maureen |last2=Thant |first2=Myint-U |year=1992 |title=The Burmese Ways to Socialism |journal=Third World Quarterly: Rethinking Socialism |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=67–75 |jstor=3992410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese Way to Socialism has largely been described by scholars as being [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], [[superstition|superstitious]] and an "abject failure" and as turning one of the most prosperous countries in [[Asia]] into [[List of Poorest Countries|one of the world's poorest]].&lt;ref name="mcgowan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGowan |first1=William |year=1993 |title=Burmese Hell |journal=World Policy Journal |publisher=The MIT Press and the World Policy Institute |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=47–56 |jstor=40209305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may have served to increase domestic stability and keep Burma from being as entangled in the [[Cold War]] struggles that affected other [[Southeast Asia]]n nations.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

The Burmese Way to Socialism, by far, greatly increased [[poverty]] and [[isolationism|isolation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ql3habQL1QC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=%22Burmese+Way+to+Socialism#PPA59,M1|title=Economic Development of Myanmar|first=Myat|last=Thein|date=16 January 2018|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|accessdate=16 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stefancollignon.de/PDF/gspmain.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=13 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813032542/http://www.stefancollignon.de/PDF/gspmain.pdf|archivedate=13 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as "disastrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFA9etqLyrEC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=%22Burmese+Way+to+Socialism#PPA2,M1|title=Economic Development of Burma: A Vision and a Strategy|first1=Khan Mon Krann|last1=(U.)|first2=University of Singapore Center for Business Research &amp;|last2=Development|date=16 January 2018|publisher=NUS Press|accessdate=16 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ne Win's later attempt to make the [[Kyat|currency]] based in denominations divisible by 9, a number he considered auspicious, wiped out the savings of millions of [[People of Burma|Burmese]]. This resulted in the pro-[[democracy]] [[8888 Uprising]], which was violently halted by the military, which established the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="newinbbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1581413.stm|title=Obituary: Ne Win|publisher=BBC | date=5 December 2002 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Under U Nu and the AFPFL-led coalition government, Burma had implemented socialist economic and welfare policies, which yielded slow economic growth throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref name="aungthwin"/&gt; On 28 October 1958, Ne Win had staged a coup, under the auspices of U Nu, who asked Ne Win to serve as interim prime minister, to restore order in the country, after the AFPFL split into two factions and U Nu barely survived a motion of no-confidence against his government in parliament. Ne Win restored order during the period known as the ''Ne Win [[caretaker government]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Nicholas Tarling | editorlink=Nicholas Tarling | year=1993 | title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia | isbn=0-521-35505-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elections were held in February 1960 and Ne Win handed back power to the victorious U Nu on 4 April 1960.

By 1958, Burma was largely beginning to recover economically, but was beginning to fall apart politically due to a split in the AFPFL into two factions, one led by Thakins Nu and Tin, the other by [[Ba Swe]] and Kyaw Nyein.&lt;ref name="ms"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin|last= Smith|year=1991|title=Burma – Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity|publisher=Zed Books|location=London and New Jersey|pages=49, 91, 50, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58–9, 60, 61, 60, 66, 65, 68, 69, 77, 78, 64, 70, 103, 92, 120, 176, 168–9, 177, 178, 180, 186, 195–7, 193, 202, 204, 199, 200, 270, 269, 275–276, 292–3, 318–320, 25, 24, 1, 4–16, 365, 375–377, 414}}&lt;/ref&gt; And this despite the unexpected success of U Nu's 'Arms for Democracy' offer taken up by U Seinda in the Arakan, the [[Pa-O]], some Mon and Shan groups, but more significantly by the PVO surrendering their arms.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; The situation became very unstable in the Union Parliament, with U Nu surviving a no-confidence vote only with the support of the opposition National United Front (NUF), believed to have 'crypto-communists' amongst them.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Army hardliners now saw the 'threat' of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) coming to an agreement with U Nu through the NUF, and in the end U Nu 'invited' Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over the country.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Over 400 'communist sympathisers' were arrested, of which 153 were deported to the Coco Island in the [[Andaman Sea]]. Among them was the NUF leader Aung Than, older brother of Aung San. Newspapers like ''Botahtaung'', ''Kyemon'' and ''Rangoon Daily'' were also closed down.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Ne Win's caretaker government successfully established the situation and paved the way for [[Burmese general election, 1960|new general elections in 1960]] that returned U Nu's Union Party with a large majority.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; The situation did not remain stable for long, when the [[Shan people|Shan]] [[federalism|Federal Movement]], started by [[Yaunghwe|Nyaung Shwe]] Saopha [[Sao Shwe Thaik]] (the first President of independent Burma 1948-52) and aspiring to a 'loose' [[federation]], was seen as a separatist movement insisting on the government honouring the right to secession in 10 years provided for by the [[Constitution of Burma|1947 Constitution]]. Ne Win had already succeeded in stripping the Shan [[Saopha]]s of their feudal powers in exchange for comfortable pensions for life in 1959.

==Ideological features==
The Burmese Way to Socialism has been described by some as [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]], [[neutralist]] and [[socialist]] in nature,&lt;ref name="badgley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Badgley |first1=John H. |year=1963 |title=Burma: The Nexus of Socialism and Two Political Traditions |journal=A Survey of Asia in 1962: Part II |publisher=University of California Press |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=89–95 |jstor=3023680 |doi=10.1525/as.1963.3.2.01p16086}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterised also by an extensive dependence on the military, emphasis on the rural populace, and Burmese (or more specifically, Burman) nationalism.&lt;ref name="badgley"/&gt; In January 1963, the Burmese Way to Socialism was further elaborated in a political public policy called the System of Correlation of Man and His Environment ({{my|လူနှင့် ပတ်ဝန်းကျင်တို့၏ အညမည သဘောတရား}}), was published, as the philosophical and political basis for the Burmese approach to society and socialism, influenced by Buddhist, humanist and Marxist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs/System-of-correlation.htm|title=THE SYSTEM OF CORRELATION OF MAN AND HIS ENVIRONMENT|website=Burmalibrary.org|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mental culture in Burmese crisis politics: Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy |last=Houtman |first=Gustaaf |year=1999 |publisher=ILCAA |location= |isbn=978-4-87297-748-6 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamentals of the Burmese Way to Socialism, as outlined in 1963, were as follows:
# In setting forth their programmes as well as in their execution the Revolutionary Council will study and appraise the concrete realities and also the natural conditions peculiar to Burma objectively. On the basis of the actual findings derived from such study and appraisal it will develop its own ways and means to progress.
# In its activities the Revolutionary Council will strive for self-improvement by way of self-criticism. Having learnt from contemporary history the evils of deviation towards right or left the Council will with vigilance avoid any such deviation.
# In whatever situations and difficulties the Revolutionary Council may find itself it will strive for advancement in accordance with the times, conditions, environment and the ever-changing circumstances, keeping at heart the basic interests of the nation.
# The Revolutionary Council will diligently seek all ways and means whereby it can formulate and carry out such programmes as are of real and practical value for the well-being of the nation. In doing so it will critically observe, study and avail itself of the opportunities provided by progressive ideas, theories and experiences at home, or abroad without discrimination between one country of origin and another.

The policy sought to reorient the Burmese economy to a socialist economy, to develop the Burmese military, and to construct a national identity among many disparate ethnic minorities and the majority Burmans.

==Impact==
Impacts of the Burmese Way to Socialism were multi-fold, affecting the economy, educational standards, and living standards of the Burmese people. Foreign aid organisations, like the American-based [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Asia Foundation]], as well as the [[World Bank]], were no longer allowed to operate in the country.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;  Only permitted was aid from a government-to-government basis. Also, English language instruction was reformed and introduced in secondary schools, whereas previously it had started in kindergarten. The government also implemented extensive visa restrictions for Burmese citizens, especially to Western countries. Instead, the government sponsored travel of students, scientists and technicians to the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] to receive training, to counter years of Western influence in the country.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; Similarly, visas for foreigners were limited to 24 hours.&lt;ref name="steinberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinberg |first1=David I. |year=1997 |title=Myanmar: The Anomalies of Politics and Economics |journal=The Asia Foundation Working Paper Series |publisher=Asia Foundation |issue=5 |url=http://asiafoundation.org/pdf/wp5.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501111851/http://asiafoundation.org/pdf/wp5.pdf |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[freedom of expression]] was limited extensively. Foreign language publications were prohibited, as were newspapers that printed "false propaganda news."&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; The [[Press Scrutiny and Registration Division|Press Scrutiny Board]] (now the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division), which censors all publications to this day (including newspapers, journals, advertisements and cartoons), was established by the RC through the Printers' and Publishers' Registration Act in August 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.mizzimamedia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=37:media-in-burma&amp;Itemid=28] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RC set up the [[Myanmar News Agency|News Agency of Burma]] (BNA) to serve as a news distribution service in the country, thus effectively replacing the work of foreign news agencies. In September 1963, ''The Vanguard'' and ''The Guardian'', two Burmese newspapers, were nationalised. In December 1965, publication of privately owned newspapers was banned by the government.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

The impact on the [[Burmese economy]] was extensive. The Enterprise Nationalization Law, passed by the [[Union Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]] in 1963, nationalised all major industries, including import-export trade, rice, banking, mining, teak and rubber on 1 June 1963.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; In total, around 15,000 private firms were nationalised.&lt;ref name="aungthwin"/&gt; Furthermore, industrialists were prohibited from establishing new factories with private capital. This was particularly detrimental to the [[Anglo-Burmese]], [[Burmese Indians]] and the British, who were disproportionately represented in these industries. The oil industry, which had previously been controlled by American and British companies such as the General Exploration Company and East Asiatic Burma Oil, were forced to end operations. In its place was the government-owned Burma Oil Company, which monopolised oil extraction and production. In August 1963, the nationalisation of basic industries, including department stores, warehouses and wholesale shops, followed.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; Price control boards were also introduced.

The Enterprise Nationalization Law directly affected foreigners in Burma, particularly Burmese Indians and the [[Burmese Chinese]], both of whom had been influential in the economic sector as entrepreneurs and industrialists. By mid-1963, 2,500 foreigners a week were leaving Burma.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt; By September 1964, approximately 100,000 Indian nationals had left the country.&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

The unofficial [[black market]] became a major feature in the economy, representing about 80% of national economy during the Socialist period.&lt;ref name="aungthwin"/&gt; Moreover, income disparity became a major socioeconomic issue.&lt;ref name="aungthwin"/&gt; Throughout the 1960s, Burma's foreign exchange reserves (to $50 million by 1971, from $214 million in 1964) steadily declined, while inflation grew.&lt;ref name="butwell"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butwell |first1=Richard |year=1972 |title=Ne Win's Burma: At the End of the First Decade |journal=Asian Survey |publisher=University of California Press |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=901–912 |url= |jstor=2643067 |doi=10.1525/as.1972.12.10.01p02694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice exports also declined, from 1,840,000 tons in 1961-62 to 350,000 tons in 1967-68, the result of both socialist policies and the inability of rice production to meet the population growth rates.

In the First [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|Burmese Socialist Programme Party]] (BSPP) Congress in 1971, economic reforms were made, in light of the failures of the economic policy pursued throughout the 1960s. The Burmese government asked to rejoin the World Bank, join the [[Asian Development Bank]] and sought more foreign aid and assistance.&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt; The [[Twenty-Year Plan]], an economic plan divided into five increments of implementation, was introduced, to develop the country's natural resources, including agriculture, forestry, oil and natural gas, through state development.&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt; These reforms brought living standards back to pre-World War II levels and stimulated economic growth.&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt; However, by 1988, foreign debt had ballooned to $4.9 billion, about three-fourths of the national GDP.&lt;ref name="steinberg"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2864">A '''candlelight vigil''' or '''candlelit vigil''' is an outdoor [[Popular assembly|assembly]] of people carrying [[candle]]s, held after [[sunset]] in order to show support for a specific cause.&lt;ref name=lovetoknow&gt;{{cite web|title=love to know: Organise a candlelight vigil|url=http://candles.lovetoknow.com/How_to_Organize_a_Candlelight_Vigil|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such events are typically held either to protest the suffering of some marginalized group of people, or in memory of the dead. In the latter case, the event is often called a '''candlelight memorial'''. A large candlelight vigil will usually have invited speakers with a [[public address system]] and may be covered by local or national [[News media|media]]. Speakers give their speech at the beginning of the vigil to explain why they are holding a vigil and what it represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Something: how to organise a vigil|url=http://www.dosomething.org/actnow/actionguide/organize-a-candlelight-vigil-your-cause-0|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vigil]]s may also have a religious or spiritual purpose. On Christmas Eve many churches hold a candlelight vigil.

Candlelight vigils are seen as a nonviolent way to raise awareness of a cause and to motivate change, as well as uniting and supporting those attending the vigil.&lt;ref name=lovetoknow /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2723">A '''civic culture''' or '''civic political culture''' is a [[political culture]] characterized by "acceptance of the authority of the state" and "a belief in participation in civic duties". The term was first used in [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]]'s  book, ''[[The Civic Culture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/civic-culture |title=civic culture: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civic political culture is  a mixture of other political cultures namely parochial, subject and participant [[political culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.regis.edu/jriley/205civicculture.htm |title=Almond and Verba's Civic Culture |publisher=Academic.regis.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almond and Verba characterised Britain as having a civic political culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Michael Longstreth Thompson]], The Cambridge Social History of Britain 1750-1950, p106&lt;/ref&gt; In "Is Britain Still a Civic Culture?" [[Patrick Seyd]] and [[Paul Whiteley]] discuss the extent to which Britain can still be regarded as having a civic political culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/6/6/6/0/p66600_index.html |title=Is Britain Still a Civic Culture? |publisher=Allacademic.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term civic culture is used to identify the political culture characteristics that explain the stability of a democratic society's political structure.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, James,Political culture in post-communist Russia,p19&lt;/ref&gt;

Almond and Verba state that the following are characteristics of a civic culture:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/research/edu20/moments/1963almondverba.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Orientation toward political system in both the political and governmental senses
*Pride in aspects of one's nation
*Expectation of fair treatment from government authorities
*Ability to talk freely and frequently about politics
*An emotional involvement in elections
*Tolerance towards opposition parties
*A Valuing of active participation in local government activities, parties, and in civic associations
*Self-confidence in one's competence to participate in politics
*Civic cooperation and trust
*Membership in the political associations.
It is worth noting that the proper combination of the various types of political culture will provide a culture that has a positive implication for the growth of democracy.

'''Classical liberalism''' is a [[political ideology]] and a [[History of liberalism|branch]] of [[liberalism]] which advocates [[civil liberties]] under the [[rule of law]] with an emphasis on [[economic freedom]].

== Evolution of core beliefs ==
Core beliefs of classical liberals included new ideas—which departed from both the older [[Conservatism|conservative]] idea of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|society as a family]] and from the later [[Sociology|sociological]] concept of society as [[Gesellschaft#Gesellschaft|complex set]] of [[social network]]s. Classical liberals believe that individuals are "egoistic, coldly calculating, essentially inert and atomistic"{{sfn|Hunt|p=44}} and that society is no more than the sum of its individual members.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=44–46}}

Classical liberals agreed with [[Thomas Hobbes]] that government had been created by individuals to protect themselves from each other and that the purpose of government should be to minimize conflict between individuals that would otherwise arise in a [[state of nature]]. These beliefs were complemented by a belief that laborers could be best motivated by financial incentive. This belief led to the passage of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], which limited the provision of social assistance, based on the idea that [[Market (economics)|markets]] are the mechanism that most efficiently leads to wealth. Adopting [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]'s population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, they believed population growth would outstrip food production and they regarded that consequence desirable because starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=49–51}}

Drawing on ideas of [[Adam Smith]], classical liberals believed that it is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea of the [[welfare state]] as interfering in a [[free market]].&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Alan Ryan, "Liberalism", in ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', ed. Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1995), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Smith’s resolute recognition of the importance and value of labor and of laborers, they selectively criticized labour's [[group rights]] being pursued at the expense of [[individual rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M. ed. (2001): ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'', London: Routledge, 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; while accepting [[Economic liberalism|corporations' rights]], which led to [[inequality of bargaining power]].{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=132}}&lt;ref name = smith&gt;{{cite book|last =Smith|first = A. |date = 1778|title =  An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|volume = I|chapter = 8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lgx2t0b3Xu&amp;sig=ygsWFIUuw8JhsxYeiXgaiE5LdNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGFIUfzqNe-N4gTvqoDgDA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22&amp;f=false|publisher = W. Strahan; and T. Cadell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical liberals argued that individuals should be free to obtain work from the highest-paying employers while the [[profit motive]] would ensure that products that people desired were produced at prices they would pay. In a free market, both labor and capital would receive the greatest possible reward while production would be organized efficiently to meet consumer demand.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=46–47}}

Classical liberals argued for what they called a minimal state, limited to the following functions:
* A government to protect individual rights and to provide services that cannot be provided in a free market.
* A common national defense to provide protection against foreign invaders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}
* Laws to provide protection for citizens from wrongs committed against them by other citizens, which included protection of private property, enforcement of contracts and common law.
* Building and maintaining public institutions.
* Public works that included a stable currency, standard weights and measures and building and upkeep of roads, canals, harbors, railways, communications and postal services.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}

They asserted that rights are of a [[Negative and positive rights|negative]] nature, which require other individuals (and governments) to refrain from interfering with the free market, opposing social liberals who assert that individuals have positive rights, such as the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to health care and the right to a living wage. For society to guarantee positive rights, it requires taxation over and above the minimum needed to enforce negative rights.&lt;ref name=Cato_Institut_Kelley&gt;[[David Kelley|Kelly, D.]] (1998): ''A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State'', Washington, DC: [[Cato Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|pp=36–38}}

Core beliefs of classical liberals did not necessarily include [[democracy]] or government by a majority vote by citizens because "there is nothing in the bare idea of majority rule to show that majorities will always respect the rights of property or maintain rule of law".&lt;ref name="RyanA_1995"&gt;Ryan, A. (1995): "Liberalism", In: Goodin, R. E. and Pettit, P., eds.: ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[James Madison]] argued for a constitutional republic with protections for individual liberty over a [[pure democracy]], reasoning that in a pure democracy a "common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole...and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party".&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, [[Federalist No. 10]] (22 November 1787), in Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison, ''The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States'', ed. Henry Cabot Lodge (New York, 1888), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XcllKruLvi4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;vq=%22common+passion+or+interest%22 p. 56].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, classical liberalism developed into [[neo-classical liberalism]], which argued for government to be as small as possible to allow the exercise of [[individual freedom]]. In its most extreme form, neo-classical liberalism advocated [[Social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name="mayne"&gt;Mayne, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right-libertarianism]] is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.&lt;ref name="mayne"/&gt;

=== Friedrich Hayek's typology of beliefs ===
[[Friedrich Hayek]] identified two different traditions within classical liberalism: the "British tradition" and the "French tradition". Hayek saw the British philosophers [[Bernard Mandeville]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Josiah Tucker]] and [[William Paley]] as representative of a tradition that articulated beliefs in [[empiricism]], the [[common law]] and in traditions and institutions which had spontaneously evolved but were imperfectly understood. The French tradition included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the [[Encyclopédistes|Encyclopedists]] and the [[Physiocrats]]. This tradition believed in rationalism and sometimes showed hostility to tradition and religion. Hayek conceded that the national labels did not exactly correspond to those belonging to each tradition: Hayek saw the Frenchmen [[Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] as belonging to the "British tradition" and the British [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Thomas Paine]] as belonging to the "French tradition".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|first = F. A. |last = Hayek|title = The Constitution of Liberty|location = London|publisher =  Routledge |date= 1976|pages =  55–56|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0otEBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Constitution+of+Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_a-MwpreAhUQXKwKHaLkCBMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn = 9781317857808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, 'Individualism: True and False', in ''Individualism and Economic Order'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek also rejected the label ''[[laissez-faire]]'' as originating from the French tradition and alien to the beliefs of Hume and Smith.

[[Guido De Ruggiero]] also identified differences between "Montesquieu and Rousseau, the English and the democratic types of liberalism"{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=71}} and argued that there was a "profound contrast between the two Liberal systems".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} He claimed that the spirit of "authentic English Liberalism" had "built up its work piece by piece without ever destroying what had once been built, but basing upon it every new departure". This liberalism had  "insensibly adapted ancient institutions to modern needs" and "instinctively recoiled from all abstract proclamations of principles and rights".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} Ruggiero claimed that this liberalism was challenged by what he called the "new Liberalism of France" that was characterised by egalitarianism and a "rationalistic consciousness".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|pp=81–82}}

In 1848, [[Francis Lieber]] distinguished between what he called "Anglican and Gallican Liberty". Lieber asserted that "independence in the highest degree, compatible with safety and broad national guarantees of liberty, is the great aim of Anglican liberty, and self-reliance is the chief source from which it draws its strength".{{sfn|Lieber|p=377}} On the other hand, Gallican liberty "is sought in government...the French look for the highest degree of political civilization in organizational, that is, in the highest degree of interference by public power".{{sfn|Lieber|pp=382–383}}

== History ==
=== Great Britain ===
Classical liberalism in Britain developed from [[Whigs (British political party)|Whiggery]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], was also heavily influenced by French [[physiocracy]] and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was associated with the defence of the British Parliament, upholding the rule of law and defending [[landed property]]. The origins of rights were seen as being in an [[ancient constitution]], which had existed from [[time immemorial]]. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by [[natural rights]]. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege rather than as a right. However, there was no consistency in Whig ideology and diverse writers including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]] were all influential among Whigs, although none of them was universally accepted.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}}

From the 1790s to the 1820s, British radicals concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasising natural rights and popular sovereignty. [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] adapted the language of Locke to the ideology of radicalism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}} The radicals saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael J. |last=Turner |year=1999 |title=British Politics in an Age of Reform |location=Manchester, England |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-51869 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was greater unity to classical liberalism ideology than there had been with Whiggery. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. They believed that required a free economy with minimal government interference. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers. Some elements of Whiggery opposed this new thinking and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature of classical liberalism. These elements became associated with conservatism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=29–30}}

[[File:1846 - Anti-Corn Law League Meeting.jpg|thumb|250px|A meeting of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in [[Exeter Hall]] in 1846]]
Classical liberalism was the dominant political theory in Britain from the early 19th century until the First World War. Its notable victories were the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829]], the [[Reform Act of 1832]] and the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure. Their policies of low public expenditure and low taxation were adopted by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] when he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Classical liberalism was often associated with religious dissent and [[nonconformism]].{{sfn|Gray|pp=26–27}}

Although classical liberals aspired to a minimum of state activity, they accepted the principle of [[government intervention]] in the economy from the early 19th century with passage of the [[Factory Acts]]. From around 1840 to 1860, ''laissez-faire'' advocates of the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] and writers in ''[[The Economist]]'' were confident that their early victories would lead to a period of expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace, but would face reversals as government intervention and activity continued to expand from the 1850s. [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of ''laissez-faire'', non-intervention in foreign affairs and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[utilitarianism]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] rejected classical liberalism altogether and advocated [[Tory democracy]]. By the 1870s, [[Herbert Spencer]] and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against them.{{sfn|Gray|p=28}} By the First World War, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had largely abandoned classical liberal principles.{{sfn|Gray|p=32}}

The changing economic and social conditions of the 19th century led to a division between neo-classical and social (or welfare) liberals, who while agreeing on the importance of individual liberty differed on the role of the state.  Neo-classical liberals, who called themselves "true liberals", saw Locke's ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise]]'' as the best guide and emphasised "limited government" while social liberals supported government regulation and the welfare state. Herbert Spencer in Britain and [[William Graham Sumner]] were the leading neo-classical liberal theorists of the 19th century.{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=596}} Neo-classical liberalism has continued into the contemporary era, with writers such as [[John Rawls]].{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=603}} The evolution from classical to social/welfare liberalism is for example reflected in Britain in the evolution of the thought of [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;See the studies of Keynes by [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], [[Donald Moggridge]] and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, liberalism took a strong root because it had little opposition to its ideals, whereas in Europe liberalism was opposed by many reactionary or feudal interests such as the nobility, the aristocracy, the landed gentry, the established church and the aristocratic army officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Louis|last= Hartz|title=The Liberal Tradition in America|date=1955|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=e1bQY1CDx2IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter = The Concept of a Liberal Society|isbn = 9780156512695|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] adopted many of the ideals of liberalism, but in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] changed Locke's "life, liberty and property" to the more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]".&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"/&gt; As the United States grew, industry became a larger and larger part of American life; and during the term of its first [[Populism|populist]] [[President of the United States|President]], [[Andrew Jackson]], economic questions came to the forefront. The economic ideas of the [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian era]] were almost universally the ideas of classical liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy M. Brown|title=Explaining the Reagan Years in Central America: A World System Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9N1duU9zgMC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-9813-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom was maximised when the government took a "hands off" attitude toward the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kahan|title=The Homestead Strike: Labor, Violence, and American Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctaTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=3 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-17397-4|page=28|quote=Called the "Jacksonian Era," this era was characterized by greater voting rights for white men, a hands-off approach to economic issues, and a desire to spread U.S. culture and government west (an outlook called "[[Manifest Destiny]]").}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues:
:[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&amp;pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' espoused liberalism every week starting in 1865 under the influential editor [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin|Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] (1831–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Gustav |last = Pollak|url = https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofamer00poll |title= Fifty Years of American Idealism: 1865-1915|date = 1915|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of classical liberalism remained essentially unchallenged until a series of [[Depression (economics)|depressions]], thought to be impossible according to the tenets of [[classical economics]], led to economic hardship from which the voters demanded relief. In the words of [[William Jennings Bryan]], "[[Cross of Gold speech|You shall not crucify the American farmer on a cross of gold]]". Classical liberalism remained the orthodox belief among American businessmen until the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Voegelin&gt;Eric Voegelin, Mary Algozin, and Keith Algozin, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1406338 "Liberalism and Its History"], ''Review of Politics'' 36, no. 4 (1974): 504–520.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a sea change in liberalism, with priority shifting from the producers to consumers. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] represented the dominance of [[modern liberalism]] in politics for decades. In the words of [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]]:&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schelesinger Jr., [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"], in ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When the growing complexity of industrial conditions required increasing government intervention in order to assure more equal opportunities, the liberal tradition, faithful to the goal rather than to the dogma, altered its view of the state. [...] There emerged the conception of a social welfare state, in which the national government had the express obligation to maintain high levels of employment in the economy, to supervise standards of life and labour, to regulate the methods of business competition, and to establish comprehensive patterns of social security.|sign=|source=}}

[[Alan Wolfe]] summarizes the viewpoint that there is a continuous liberal understanding that includes both [[Adam Smith]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Alan|last = Wolfe|url = http://www.tnr.com/blog/alan-wolfe/false-distinction |title = A False Distinction |work = The New Republic|date = 12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The idea that liberalism comes in two forms assumes that the most fundamental question facing mankind is how much government intervenes into the economy... When instead we discuss human purpose and the meaning of life, Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes are on the same side. Both of them possessed an expansive sense of what we are put on this earth to accomplish. [...] For Smith, mercantilism was the enemy of human liberty. For Keynes, monopolies were. It makes perfect sense for an eighteenth-century thinker to conclude that humanity would flourish under the market.

It represents adherence to the bourgeois organization of society epitomized by that much-maligned word, "Victorian": with its faith in individualism, capitalism, progress, and virtue. Having been silenced by the seemingly endless march of "embedded liberalism" since the New Deal, American conservatism has, since the late 1960s, regrouped, and under Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush created a new powerful political movement. Thus, apart from the brief period of Margaret Thatcher's ascendancy in Britain, it is only in the United States that the classical liberal tradition continues to have political force.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to classical liberal ideology was their interpretation of [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'', which had been written as a defence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although these writings were considered too radical at the time for Britain's new rulers, they later came to be cited by Whigs, radicals and supporters of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Dworetz, ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of later liberal thought was absent in Locke's writings or scarcely mentioned and his writings have been subject to various interpretations. For example, there is little mention of [[constitutionalism]], the [[separation of powers]] and [[limited government]].{{sfn|Richardson|pp=22–23}}

James L. Richardson identified five central themes in Locke's writing: [[individualism]], consent, the concepts of the [[rule of law]] and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.{{sfn|Richardson|p=23}}

As a trustee, government was expected to serve the interests of the people, not the rulers; and rulers were expected to follow the laws enacted by legislatures. Locke also held that the main purpose of men uniting into commonwealths and governments was for the preservation of their property. Despite the ambiguity of Locke's definition of property, which limited property to "as much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of", this principle held great appeal to individuals possessed of great wealth.{{sfn|Richardson|pp=23–24}}

Locke held that the individual had the right to follow his own religious beliefs and that the state should not impose a religion against [[Dissenter]]s, but there were limitations. No tolerance should be shown for [[Atheism|atheists]], who were seen as amoral, or to [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], who were seen as owing allegiance to the Pope over their own national government.{{sfn|Richardson|p=24}}

=== Adam Smith ===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Adam Smith]]]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in 1848.{{sfn|Mills|pp=63, 68}} Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow to maximise wealth.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

Smith wrote that as long as supply, demand, prices and competition were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the public good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

He assumed that workers could be paid wages as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=65}} His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.{{sfn|Mills|p=66}} He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions.{{sfn|Mills|p=67}} Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income.{{sfn|Mills|p=68}}

Smith's economics was carried into practice in the nineteenth century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}}

=== Classical economics ===
In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]' theories of population and [[David Ricardo]]'s [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of [[classical economics]]. The pessimistic nature of these theories provided a basis for criticism of capitalism by its opponents and helped perpetuate the tradition of calling economics the "[[dismal science]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] was a French economist who introduced Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and Britain.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}} Say challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was Say's law, which was interpreted by classical economists that there could be no overproduction in a market and that there would always be a balance between supply and demand.{{sfn|Mills|p=70}} This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the economic cycle was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.{{sfn|Mills|p=71}}

Malthus wrote two books, ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (published in 1798) and ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]]'' (published in 1820). The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists.{{sfn|Mills|pp=71–72}} However, his first book became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.{{sfn|Mills|p=72}}

Ricardo, who was an admirer of Smith, covered many of the same topics, but while Smith drew conclusions from broadly empirical observations he used deduction, drawing conclusions by reasoning from basic assumptions {{sfn|Mills|pp=73–74}} While Ricardo accepted Smith's [[labour theory of value]], he acknowledged that utility could influence the price of some rare items. Rents on agricultural land were seen as the production that was surplus to the subsistence required by the tenants. Wages were seen as the amount required for workers' subsistence and to maintain current population levels.{{sfn|Mills|pp=74–75}} According to his iron law of wages, wages could never rise beyond subsistence levels. Ricardo explained profits as a return on capital, which itself was the product of labour, but a conclusion many drew from his theory was that profit was a surplus appropriated by [[Capitalism|capitalists]] to which they were not entitled.{{sfn|Mills|p=75}}

=== Utilitarianism ===
[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s later writings on the subject foreshadowed the [[welfare state]], it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.{{sfn|Richardson|p=32}}

The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that public policy should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

== Political economy ==
Classical liberals saw utility as the foundation for public policies. This broke both with conservative "[[Traditionalist conservatism|tradition]]" and [[Natural rights#John Locke|Lockean "natural rights"]], which were seen as irrational. Utility, which emphasises the happiness of individuals, became the central ethical value of all liberalism.{{sfn|Richardson|p=31}} Although utilitarianism inspired wide-ranging reforms, it became primarily a justification for ''laissez-faire'' economics. However, classical liberals rejected Smith's belief that the "invisible hand" would lead to general benefits and embraced Malthus' view that population expansion would prevent any general benefit and Ricardo's view of the inevitability of class conflict. ''Laissez-faire'' was seen as the only possible economic approach and any government intervention was seen as useless and harmful. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] was defended on "scientific or economic principles" while the authors of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601]] were seen as not having had the benefit of reading Malthus.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

However, commitment to ''laissez-faire'' was not uniform and some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]] as Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by [[Richard Cobden]] and the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}} The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''The Economist'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}}

''The Economist'' also campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. A rigid belief in ''laissez-faire'' guided the government response in 1846–1849 to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. The minister responsible for economic and financial affairs, [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Charles Wood]], expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}} The [[Corn Laws]] were finally repealed in 1846 by the removal of tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high,&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; but it came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy. ''A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland''. Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1074-9}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee. ''Aspects of British Political History, 1815–1914''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-415-09006-3}}. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free trade and world peace ==
Several liberals, including Smith and Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations could lead to [[world peace]]. Erik Gartzke states: "Scholars like Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Richard Cobden, [[Norman Angell]], and [[Richard Rosecrance]] have long speculated that [[free market]]s have the potential to free states from the looming prospect of recurrent warfare".&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; American political scientists John R. Oneal and Bruce M. Russett, well known for their work on the democratic peace theory, state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J. R.|first2=B. M.|title=The Classical Liberals Were Right: Democracy, Interdependence, and Conflict, 1950–1985|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=2|pages=267–294|year=1997|last1=Oneal|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00042|last2=Russet}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The classical liberals advocated policies to increase liberty and prosperity. They sought to empower the commercial class politically and to abolish royal charters, monopolies, and the protectionist policies of mercantilism so as to encourage entrepreneurship and increase productive efficiency. They also expected democracy and laissez-faire economics to diminish the frequency of war.}}

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', Smith argued that as societies progressed from hunter gatherers to industrial societies the spoils of war would rise, but that the costs of war would rise further and thus making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[T]he honours, the fame, the emoluments of war, belong not to [the middle and industrial classes]; the battle-plain is the harvest field of the aristocracy, watered with the blood of the people...Whilst our trade rested upon our foreign dependencies, as was the case in the middle of the last century...force and violence, were necessary to command our customers for our manufacturers...But war, although the greatest of consumers, not only produces nothing in return, but, by abstracting labour from productive employment and interrupting the course of trade, it impedes, in a variety of indirect ways, the creation of wealth; and, should hostilities be continued for a series of years, each successive war-loan will be felt in our commercial and manufacturing districts with an augmented pressure|[[Richard Cobden]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Stringham, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1676244 "Commerce, Markets, and Peace: Richard Cobden's Enduring Lessons"], ''Independent Review'' 9, no. 1 (2004): 105, 110, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}
{{quote|[B]y virtue of their mutual interest does nature unite people against violence and war, for the concept of cosmopolitan right does not protect them from it. The spirit of trade cannot coexist with war, and sooner or later this spirit dominates every people. For among all those powers (or means) that belong to a nation, financial power may be the most reliable in forcing nations to pursue the noble cause of peace (though not from moral motives); and wherever in the world war threatens to break out, they will try to head it off through mediation, just as if they were permanently leagued for this purpose.|[[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], ''The Perpetual Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small, but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets. The belief that free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), who was a classical liberal in his early life, to say that this was a doctrine on which he was "brought up" and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-9780198292364;jsessionid=4B0FEAE67C6CC2944F0147AFD5045F62?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp; ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''], Oxford University Press, 2006, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of a book on Keynes, Michael S. Lawlor argues that it may be in large part due to Keynes' contributions in economics and politics, as in the implementation of the [[Marshall Plan]] and the way economies have been managed since his work, "that we have the luxury of not facing his unpalatable choice between free trade and full employment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://eh.net/book_reviews/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-economic-paths-to-war-and-peace/ John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace]  Donald Markwell (2006), reviewed by M S Lawlor (February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A related manifestation of this idea was the argument of [[Norman Angell]] (1872–1967), most famously before World War I in ''[[The Great Illusion]]'' (1909), that the interdependence of the economies of the major powers was now so great that war between them was futile and irrational; and therefore unlikely.

Command-and-control management is categorised by systems thinkers as the dominant method of management in the Western world. Key influences are said to include [[Alfred P. Sloan]], [[Henry Ford]], [[James O. McKinsey|James McKinsey]] of the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|eponymous accounting firm]], and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. A well-known modern exponent is [[Michael Barber (educationist)|Michael Barber]], himself a partner in McKinsey &amp; Company.

It is characterised by some systems thinkers according to the following attributes:

'''Perspective''': Top-down and hierarchical&lt;br /&gt;
'''Design''': Organisations divided into (ostensibly) independent functional silos. A practice propagated by Alfred Sloan and James McKinsey&lt;br /&gt;
'''Decision-making''': Separated from work. A separation spearheaded by Frederick Winslow Taylor&lt;br /&gt;
'''Measures''': Arbitrary targets analysed by binary comparison&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ethos''': Control of staff&lt;br /&gt;
'''Change''': Plans delivered by Prince II methodology&lt;br /&gt;
'''Motivation''': Control-by-seduction (carrot) and control-by-fear (stick)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Attitude to suppliers and customers''': Contractual.

Key critics of the command-and-control management ethos and techniques include members of the systems-thinking community and associated thinkers, including [[W. Edwards Deming]],&lt;ref&gt;''Out of the Crisis'', W. Edwards Deming, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Seddon]],&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom from Command and Control'', John Seddon, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kōnosuke Matsushita]],&lt;ref&gt;https://vanguard-method.net/library/management-thinkers/konosuke-matsushita/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiichi Ohno]], [[Russell L. Ackoff]],&lt;ref&gt;''Management f-Laws'', Russell Ackoff, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donella Meadows]],&lt;ref&gt;''Thinking in Systems'', Donella Meadows, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfie Kohn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Punished by Rewards'', Alfie Kohn, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and the outspoken [[The Vanguard Method|Vanguard Method]] practitioner John Little.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/11/snouts-in-the-trough-outsourcing-farm.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century John Seddon in particular has been deeply critical of successive [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK governments]]' propagation of command-and-control thinking in the [[National Health Service|NHS]], local authorities, and other public services.

Organisations credited with having moved away from the command-and-control paradigm to a systems-thinking philosophy include [[Harley Davidson]] and [[Aviva]], in addition to many Japanese companies, such as [[Toyota]], [[Honda]], and [[Panasonic]].

In [[politics]], '''crossing the floor''' is when a politician changes their allegiance or votes against their party in a [[Westminster system]] parliament. Crossing the floor may be voting against the approved party lines, or changing to another party after being elected while a member of a first party. While these practices are legally permissible, crossing the floor can lead to controversy and media attention. As well, voting against party lines may lead to consequences such as losing a position (e.g., as minister or a portfolio critic) or being ejected from the party caucus.  [[Maldives]] and [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24624 |title= Article 70(b) of Constitution of People's Republic of Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; have laws which removes the member from parliament due to floor-crossing.

==Etymology==
The term originates from the [[British House of Commons]], which is configured with the Government and [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]] facing each other on rows of benches. In consequence, an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who switches from the governing party to one in opposition (or vice versa) also changes which side of the chamber they sit on. A notable example of this is [[Winston Churchill]], who crossed the floor from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to the [[Liberal party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1904, before later crossing back in 1924.

==Voting against party lines==
The term has passed into general use in other [[Westminster System|Westminster]] parliamentary democracies (such as [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Australia|Australia]], [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Politics of South Africa|South Africa]]) even if many of these countries have semicircular or horseshoe-shaped debating chambers and mechanisms for voting without [[Members of Parliament]] leaving their seats. In most countries, it is most often used to describe members of the government party or parties who defect and vote with the opposition against some piece of government-sponsored legislation, but that usage is not widespread in Canada, where the term's usage is restricted to the original definition.

Most political parties let their members have a free vote on some matters of personal conscience.

In Australia, one of the major parties (the [[Australian Labor Party]]) requires its members to pledge their support for the collective decisions of the Caucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2F31KH6%22 |title=Crossing the floor in the Federal Parliament 1950 – August 2004 |work=Research Note no. 11 2005–06 |publisher=Australian Parliament |date=October 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which theoretically prohibits them from crossing the floor; however, in practice, some Labor members disregard this pledge despite the disciplinary action which may result. Among other parties, crossing the floor is rare although former Senator [[Barnaby Joyce]] of the [[National Party of Australia]] crossed the floor 19 times under the Howard coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/independently-inclined-20080530-2jzv.html?page=2 |title=Independently inclined |publisher=The Age |first=Penelope |last=Debelle |date=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the record for crossing the floor in the Australian Parliament goes to Tasmanian Senator Sir [[Reg Wright]], who voted against his own party (the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]) on 150 occasions.

==Changing parties==
In the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, the term is also used to describe leaving one's party entirely and joining another party, such as leaving an opposition party to support the government (or vice versa), or even leaving one opposition party to join another. In both Canada and the United Kingdom, the term carries only this meaning and is not used for a simple vote against the party line on a bill.

In April 2006, the premier of [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], [[Gary Doer]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba]], proposed a ban on crossing the floor of the Manitoba legislature in response to "the concern some voters have expressed over the high-profile defections of three federal MPs from their parties in just over two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323022203/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archivedate=March 23, 2007|title=Proposed reforms would ban floor-crossing in Man. |first=Michelle |last=Macafee |publisher=Canadian Press |date=April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting legislation, which amended the provincial ''Legislative Assembly Act'', mandated that Members of the Legislature who quit their political party must serve out the remainder of their term as independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/2006/c01506ee.php |title=The Elections Reform Act - Schedule E |work=Statutes of Manitoba |publisher=Manitoba Laws |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extraordinary example occurred in Alberta, Canada in December 2014 when [[Danielle Smith]], the leader of the official opposition [[Wildrose Party]], and eight of her MLAs crossed the floor together to join the governing [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnews.ca/news/1737886/danielle-smiths-move-to-pcs-unprecedented/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2397">'''Cymru Annibynnol, the Independent Wales Party''' is a small [[political party]] operating in [[Wales]].  They were formed as a splinter from [[Plaid Cymru]] in January 2000, when that party's leader [[Ieuan Wyn Jones]] distanced Plaid from supporting [[Welsh independence]].

Cymru Annibynnol are an expressly [[republicanism|republican]] organisation seeking full independence for Wales from the [[United Kingdom]].  They contested various seats in the [[Welsh Assembly]] elections of 2003.  The party describes their aims and methods as being:

: ''People voluntarily organising and pursuing their aims by peaceful political activity freely associating together according to the provisions of the Party's Constitution. The party is non-[[sectarian]] and inclusive of all people who consider themselves Welsh.''

: ''Our aim is to secure full Independence for Wales as a democratic and sovereign state ensuring economic prosperity and social harmony for the people of Wales and safeguarding our common Welsh [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], [[Welsh language|language]], culture and identity.''

Broadly they are like Plaid Cymru: a left-leaning party that favours independence as a means to combatting what they perceive as the negative effects of [[globalisation]], also favouring [[redistribution (economics)|wealth redistributive measures]].

They have stated that they do not intend to contest elections to the [[British House of Commons]] and will instead contest only local elections, and those to the Welsh Assembly.  They contested the [[Welsh Assembly Election, 2003|2003 Assembly elections]] but did not poll highly.  They have thus far to make much impact politically.

Cymru Annibynnol changed its name in 2004 when it became [[Cymru Rydd]] - Welsh Republicans. Its tag line is "Fe godwn ni eto! We shall rise again"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">In general, '''expansionism''' consists of policies of governments and states that involve territorial, military or economic expansion. While some have linked the term to promoting [[economic growth]] (in contrast to [[Steady-state economy|no growth]] or sustainable policies), more commonly expansionism refers to the doctrine of a state expanding its territorial base or economic influence. This occurs usually, though not necessarily, by means of military aggression. Compare [[empire-building]], [[colonialism]], and ''mensurable''.

[[Anarchism]], [[reunification]] or [[pan-nationalism]] are sometimes used to justify and legitimize expansionism, but only when the explicit goal is to reconquer territories that have been lost, or to take over ancestral lands. A simple territorial dispute, such as a border dispute, is not usually referred to as expansionism.

Countries with nuclear weapons are more likely to exhibit expansionist behavior; particularly, if the state is not a democracy, and even if such state's public ideology is non-interference. Depending on chosen strategy, expansionism manifests in brute force or any threat of it, or in economic measures (a debt trap through infrastructure "investments" via burdensome loans), active measures (such as espionage, sabotage, manipulation of critical infrastructure), or a combination thereof. With conflicts that involve war, mutual accusations of expansionism are inevitable between nuclear powers that have strategic overlap.

==Past examples==
{{expand section|more historical examples|date=November 2017}} 
The militarist and nationalistic reign of [[Czar Nicholas I]] (1825–1855) led to wars of conquest against [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Persia (1826–1828)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Turkey (1828–1829)]]. Various rebel tribes in the [[Caucasus]] region were crushed. A [[November Uprising|Polish revolt]] in 1830 was ruthlessly crushed. Russian troops in 1848 crossed into [[Austria-Hungary]] to put down the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolt]]. [[Russification]] policies were implemented to weaken minority ethnic groups. Nicholas also built the [[Kremlin Palace]] and a new cathedral in Saint Petersburg. But [[Pan-slavism]] ambition led to further war with Turkey (the [[Sick man of Europe]]) in 1853 provoked Britain and France into [[Crimean War|invading Crimea]], and Nicholas died, supposedly of grief at his defeat. &lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], Crimea, Penguin, 2011, chapter one &lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Second Reich]] (1871–1918) underwent an industrial revolution under [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], who also reformed and expanded the army. Poles and Catholics were persecuted. Colonies were acquired in Africa and China. In 1890, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] dismissed Bismarck and resolved to build a world-class Navy, which led to an [[arms race]] with Britain and thence to World War One. &lt;ref&gt; [[Allan Mallinson]], '1914; Fight the Good Fight', Bantam Press, 2013, chapter two &lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 the [[Third Reich]] under Hitler laid claim to the [[Rhineland]], the [[Sudetenland]], unification (''[[Anschluss]]'') with Austria in 1938, and the whole of the Czech lands the following year. After war broke out, Hitler and Stalin divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. In a ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' aimed at achieving ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German people, Germany invaded the USSR in 1941. &lt;ref&gt; [[Sebastian Haffner]], [[The Meaning of Hitler]], Phoenix, 2000, chapters 2,3 and 4 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonialism]], a form of expansionism is the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories, generally with the aim of developing or exploiting them to the benefit of the colonizing country.&lt;ref&gt;''Colonialism'', Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 ed.) p. 291.; ''Colonialisme'', Nouveau Petit Robert de la langue française (1993 ed.), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of colonialism|European colonial period]] was the era from the 15th century to the mid-20th century when several European powers had established colonies in the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].

[[Expansionist nationalism]] is an aggressive and radical form of [[nationalism]] that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a belief in expansionism. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the '[[Scramble for Africa]]' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist_regime_.281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Japanese empire]], and the [[Balkans]] countries of [[Albanian nationalism|Albania]] ([[Greater Albania]]), [[Bulgarian nationalism|Bulgaria]] ([[Greater Bulgaria]]), [[Croatian nationalism|Croatia]] ([[Greater Croatia]]), [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungary]] ([[Hungarian irredentism|Greater Hungary]]), [[Romanian nationalism|Romania]] ([[Greater Romania]]) and [[Serbian nationalism|Serbia]] ([[Greater Serbia]]).

==21st century==
===China===
The People's Republic of China is expanding its operations and influence in the [[South China Sea]], claiming possession of disputed offshore islands in the search for oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Tisdall]], 'Vietnam's fury at China's expansionism can be traced to a troubled history', [[The Guardian]], 15/5/2004&lt;/ref&gt; A major instrument of influence is the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].

===Israel===
[[Israel]] has tried to expand its territory and power through the occupation of the [[Syria|Syrian]] Golan Heights,&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/&lt;/ref&gt; the killing of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] civilians in the [[Gaza Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/gaza-protest-latest-updates-180406092506561.html&lt;/ref&gt; warring with neighbouring [[Lebanon]] (2006) and openly considering future wars,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/leaders/2006/08/17/nasrallah-wins-the-war&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/a-new-war-could-erupt-as-tensions-rise-between-israel-and-lebanon-2017-10&lt;/ref&gt; striking Syrian and Iranian forces that purport to defend the Syria against [[Daesh]] terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rt.com/news/437647-israel-strikes-syria-iran/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]], the largest [[Shi'ite]] state, has extended its influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Arango]], 'Iran Dominates in Iraq after US 'handed the country over'', [[The New York Times]], 15/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
[[Russia]]'s behavior threatens the integrity and existence of [[NATO]] member states and Russia's non-NATO neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=Russian expansionism may pose existential threat, says NATO general |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2015-02-20 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/russia-existential-threat-british-nato-general |accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events associated with Russia are: the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]] and Russia's [[Occupied territories of Georgia|occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia]]; the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], which began in 2014 with the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Annexation of Crimea]] and the [[War in Donbass]]; and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|military intervention in Syria]].

===United States===
The [[United States]] is seen to be using its power to expand its influence. Criticism is meted out for large-scale events (wars); for expressing support in favor of opposition groups, and for aiding the rebel groups' aspirations to remove governments. The war in [[Afghanistan]] was begun in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks; despite opposition by traditional allies such as [[France]], a war in [[Iraq]] was declared based on the inaccurate information of Iraq hosting weapons of mass destruction. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, however a controversial [[Iraqi oil law|oil law]] was passed through American influence, largely privatising the valuable commodity of oil to foreign companies. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-afghanistan-announce-war-us-army-escalation-pakistan-a7905821.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2018/02/23/trump-administration-troops-can-stay-in-iraq-syria-indefinitely/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/opinion/13juhasz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the United States extends to: embargoing countries such as Cuba;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-un/us-trade-embargo-has-cost-cuba-130-billion-un-says-idUSKBN1IA00T&lt;/ref&gt; building military bases around the world, especially in the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Persian Gulf]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americansecurityproject.org/national-security-strategy/u-s-bases-in-the-middle-east/&lt;/ref&gt; supporting opposition groups in [[Libya]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] during the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Syrian Civil War]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-usa-order/exclusive-obama-authorizes-secret-help-for-libya-rebels-idUSTRE72T6H220110330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkey-to-u-s-end-support-for-syrian-kurd-ypg-or-risk-confrontation-idUSKBN1FE297&lt;/ref&gt; implementing sanctions against the leaderships of countries [[Venezuela]], [[Russia]], and Iran;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html&lt;/ref&gt; deploying its navy in the [[South China Sea]], widely seen as a way to counter Chinese claims in the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2166910/us-navy-plans-major-show-strength-south-china-sea-warning&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit rhetoric of president [[Donald Trump|Trump]] and his political satellites has had a damaging effect on the United States itself. Examples of such are the overt rhetoric advocating the overthrow of democratically-elected governments deemed undemocratic by the United States, such as in [[Venezuela]], [[Iran]], and [[Syria]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/08/trump-nicolas-maduro-overthrow-venezuelan-meetings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-opposition/trump-lawyer-giuliani-says-irans-government-will-be-overthrown-idUSKCN1M3005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/12/08/officials-obama-prioritized-defeating-assad-above-defeating-jihadists.html&lt;/ref&gt; the influencing of the blockade of countries such as [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/timeline-gcc-egyptian-discord-qatar-170605063154230.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, the United States is also seen to be asserting its dominance economically. Faced by a rapidly-internationalising Renminbi and a growing eurozone, the United States is using the global dominance of the US dollar in worldwide trade to indiscriminately sanction [[NATO]] allies such as [[Turkey]], as well as rival countries such as [[Russia]], Venezuela and Iran;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/world/europe/us-sanctions-turkey-pastor.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/us-senators-introduce-russia-sanctions-bill-from-hell-idUSKBN1KN22Q &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/trump-maduro-venezuela-sanctions.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/10/global-powers-condemn-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-encourage-business.html &lt;/ref&gt; using protectionist measures against traditional allies and fellow [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]-members, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[European Union]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-tariffs-in-us-canada-china-eu-mexico-world-2018-7&lt;/ref&gt; and initiating a major trade war with economic rival [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45294162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies==

In the nineteenth century, theories of racial unity such as [[Pan-Germanism]], [[Pan-Slavism]], [[Pan-Turkism]] and the related [[Turanism]], evolved. In each case, the dominant nation (respectively, [[Prussia]], [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Orlando Figes]], ''Crimea'', Penguin, 2011, p.89 &lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially under [[Enver Pasha]],) used these theories to legitimise their expansionist policies.

==In popular culture==

[[George Orwell]]'s satirical novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'' is a fictional depiction, based on [[Stalin]]'s [[USSR]], of a new elite seizing power, establishing new rules and hierarchies, then expanding economically while compromising their ideals; while [[Robert Erskine Childers]] in ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' portrayed the threatening nature of the German [[Second Reich]]. [[Elspeth Huxley]]'s novel [[Red Strangers]] shows the effects on local culture of colonial expansion into sub-Saharan Africa.

The '''Four-Stage Theory of the [[Republic of China]]''' or the '''Theory of the Four Stages of the Republic of China''' is a viewpoint proposed by [[Chen Shui-bian]], the [[President of the Republic of China|President of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]] from 2000 to 2008, in 2005. It is a viewpoint regarding the [[Political status of Taiwan|political status of the Republic of China]], whose government retreated to [[Taiwan]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. The main idea of the theory is that the time line for the development of the Republic of China can be classified into four stages, which are:

By this [[theory]], Chen pointed out that the Republic of China was at the 4th stage after [[Taiwan presidential election, 2000|the first ruling party rotation of the central government in 2000]]. That is, Taiwan, with the official name called the "[[Republic of China]]", is already an independent sovereign state separate from [[People's Republic of China]]. This theory is welcomed by the mainstream of the [[Pan-Green coalition]] (led by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]) in Taiwan, which supports eventual ''de jure'' [[Taiwan independence]]; but is not welcomed by most members of the [[Pan-Blue coalition]] ([[Kuomintang]]), which supports the eventual [[Chinese reunification|reunification of Taiwan with mainland China]] as part of a single "[[Chinese nation]]". Some members of the more strongly pro-independence [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] also oppose this view since they deem the ROC to be an illegitimate foreign and colonial regime that should be replaced by the proposed "[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]". The Pan-Blue Coalition agrees with the first three stages, but disagrees with the fourth stage, and prefers to maintain the distinction between the "Republic of China" (the polity) and "Taiwan" (part of the territory the polity governs). The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] has also voiced opposition against the fourth stage on the grounds that such an interpretation is a step closer to ''de jure'' Taiwan independence. (Officially, the PRC claims the existence of the ROC only until 1949.)&lt;ref name="Taipei Times 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taipei Times 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBP"&gt;International Business Publications, USA, [https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=XghBi4moFK4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=zh-TW#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Position of the Republic of China (ROC)], ''Taiwan Country Study Guide: Strategic Information and Developments'', 2012/3/3, p45&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the ''[[Free China Journal]]'' and the ''[[Taiwan Journal|Free China Weekly]]'' often referred to the polity as the "'''Republic of China on Taiwan'''" prior to [[Lee Teng-hui]] taking office as the first Taiwan-born President of the Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democracy's coming of age|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=4974|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 December 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Helping hands for reconstruction|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=5164|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 September 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Double Tenth of confidence|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=5532|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 November 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Month in Free China|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=8,8,29,32,32,45&amp;post=13829|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 June 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Documents|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=6159|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 August 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Lee's administration, the term remained in use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reaping Ideas And Criticism|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=4664|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Please call me Mr. Ching-kuo'|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=20,29,35,45&amp;post=25750|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perceptions And Realities|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&amp;post=5460|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Redefining Social Order|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=12,29,33,45&amp;post=22524|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taiwan Review|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,8,29,31,32,45&amp;post=4580|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Free China Journal/Taiwan Today|date=1 February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the term in his speech at [[Cornell University]], [[Ithaca]], [[New York State|New York]], United States in June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=13324&amp;ctNode=103 Text of Lee's Cornell address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030001106/http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=13324&amp;ctNode=103 |date=2016-10-30 }}, TAIWAN INFO, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1995-6-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.tvbs.com.tw/other/389500 國家定位　李前總統︰ROC在台灣], [[TVBS]], 2003/12/21&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to identify the [[Republic of China]] with its remaining major component &amp;ndash; the [[island of Taiwan]], as opposed to its decades-long claim to all China since losing the [[Chinese civil war|civil war]] in 1949. Prior to this speech, the government officials used "Republic of China" when the name of the state was used. Lee's usage is considered as a departure from the convention, as this usage can be interpreted in the sense that the Republic of China's sovereignty does not extend to [[mainland China]], which the People's Republic of China controls.&lt;ref name="IBP"/&gt;

The [[Democratic Progressive Party]]'s 1999 [[Resolution on Taiwan's Future]], which is accorded equivalent status as the Party charter, serves as the baseline of debates toward the "[[status quo]]". According to the 1999 Resolution: "Taiwan is a sovereign and independent state and that its national title is the ROC." In other words, "Taiwan is the ROC".&lt;ref name="Jamestown Foundation"&gt;[https://jamestown.org/program/dpps-cross-strait-policy-consistent-with-status-quo/ DPP’s Cross-Strait Policy Consistent with “Status Quo”], [[Jamestown Foundation]], 2011/12/20&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) administration under [[Chen Shui-bian]], he directed that all government publications and websites to use the form "'''Republic of China (Taiwan)'''." These two variations have been used under their respective administrations for the [[China and the United Nations|ROC/Taiwan petition to join the United Nations]]. Unlike the Cold War era when the KMT-controlled ROC competed with the PRC as the legitimate representative of [[China]] (including Taiwan), during Chen Shui-bian's presidency, the ROC did not seek to be the representative of China (i.e. it does not seek the PRC's seat on the Security Council or its ouster) and stresses in its petitions that it was only seeking to represent the people of the land under its effective control (i.e. UN's principle of universality).&lt;ref name="IBP"/&gt;

In October 8, 2011, the eve of the centennial celebration of the founding of the Republic of China on [[October 10]], the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) Chairperson [[Tsai Ing-wen]] and the presidential candidate for [[Taiwan presidential election, 2012|the 2012 Taiwan presidential election]] explained her stance on the existence of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]] as "...the Republic of China has lost the land on which it was originally established. It only exists in Taiwan. It has merged into the land and [[people of Taiwan]]. Today, the majority of the people in Taiwan can agree that '''Taiwan is the Republic of China, and the Republic of China is Taiwan.'''", "Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country", and "...after we [[Taiwan presidential election, 1996|began directly electing our president]], the current Republic of China government is no longer a foreign government. It is now the [[government of Taiwan]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/Read.aspx?sno=01EECCB4FEE085BC96BCD62A0FC3F053 Tsai presents “ROC is Taiwan” stance on eve of centenary], [[FTV News|Formosa News]], 2011/10/09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taipei Times"&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/10/10/2003515353 Tsai affirms recognition of the ROC], [[Taipei Times]], 2011/10/10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamestown Foundation"/&gt;

Chen Yi-shen (陳儀深), an associate researcher at the [[:zh:中央研究院近代史研究所|Institute of Modern History]] at [[Academia Sinica]], said "many are aware that the ROC and Taiwan are two faces of the same coin" and Tsai's ROC was an extension of the ROC from former presidents [[Lee Teng-hui]] and [[Chen Shui-bian]]. While some understood "elections have their own languages", many Taiwanese, including former [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] Chairman and former President of the [[Examination Yuan]] [[Yao Chia-wen]], are absolutely against the ROC and insist "we need to promote the rectification our nation's name to the [[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]".&lt;ref name="Taipei Times"/&gt;

Tsai won [[Taiwan presidential election, 2016|the 2016 Taiwan presidential election]] and sworn in as first female [[President of Taiwan]] on May 20.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32934">'''Gulargate''' was a 2012–2013 [[political corruption]] scandal in [[Azerbaijan]] involving civil servants and government officials of various levels, serving in positions as high as the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]] and the [[Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic|Presidential Administration]]. It flared up on 25 September 2012 after Azerbaijani lawyer and former university rector [[Elshad Abdullayev]] (now residing in [[France]]) posted a hidden camera video on [[YouTube]] showing his meeting with Member of Parliament [[Gular Ahmadova]] negotiating a bribe to secure a seat in the National Assembly for Abdullayev in the [[Azerbaijan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]]. The scandal widened after a series of similar videos involving other officials and other cases of corruption were posted by Abdullayev at later dates, followed by sackings, arrests and deaths of some of those who appeared in the videos.&lt;ref name="pace"&gt;[http://www.assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2013/NYFf%C4%B1nalpressfjdoc1e.pdf Corruption as a threat to the Rule of Law]. Report by the PACE Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights. AS/Jur (2013) 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Gulargate" derives from the first name of now former MP Gular Ahmadova who appeared in the very first video. It was coined by Azerbaijani media on the day following the release of the first video&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24720635.html Attorney General Investigating Gulargate Scandal]. Radio Liberty. 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with the [[Watergate scandal]] of the 1970s. The term was later republished and used by English-language media outlets&lt;ref name="azerireport"&gt;[http://azerireport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3740 Gulargate Grows as Ahmadova Threatens Ruling Party Members with Revelations]. Azeri Report. 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the corruption report of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights.&lt;ref name="pace"/&gt; Despite the term coinage, most videos are related to the kidnapping of Elshad Abdullayev's brother Mahir Abdullayev and not to Gular Ahmadova.

==Background==
Elshad Abdullayev, who holds a doctorate degree in jurisprudence, had been known as the rector of the [[Azerbaijan International University]] which functioned from 1997 to 2010 and for the last four years was a focus of investigation of the Attorney General's Office over reported cases of corruption and illegal student admission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/society/226544.html Ministry of Education Shut Down Azerbaijani University]. ''Day.az''. 1 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Abdullayev's older brother Mahir Abdullayev, an officer of the Ministry of State Security, was kidnapped, and a state investigation which linked his disappearance to the criminal activity of the gang led by [[Haji Mammadov]] did not yield any results.

In 2005, Elshad Abdullayev ran as a candidate from the ruling [[New Azerbaijan Party]] for a seat in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. The results in the [[Binagadi|Binagadi II]] constituency which he wished to represent were announced as void and a by-election was scheduled for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/politics/42964.html In By-Elections New Azerbaijan Party to Run with 5 Candidates]. ''Day.az''. 3 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after being found guilty of bribing potential voters during his campaign, Abdullayev was stripped of his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/politics/47654.html Elshad Abdullayev's Candidacy Annulled for Voter Bribery]. ''Day.az''. 29 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Abdullayev, who believed he had in fact won, later blamed "certain powers" who allegedly did not wish for him to find out the truth behind his brother's kidnapping; the information he believed he could have accessed, had he been elected in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sehife.az/politika/2758-elshad-abdullaev-predstavil-novuyu-sensacionnuyu-videozapis-video.html Elshad Abdullayev Released New Feature Video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008223139/http://sehife.az/politika/2758-elshad-abdullaev-predstavil-novuyu-sensacionnuyu-videozapis-video.html |date=2012-10-08 }}. 4 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, he had managed to collect information about a "gang of criminals" related to the kidnapping and submitted it to the [[Ministry of National Security of Azerbaijan|Ministry of National Security]] and the Attorney General's Office in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref name="threat"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24721293.html Elshad Abdullayev Claims Being Threatened]. Radio Liberty. 29 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 7 December 2012 interview to [[Radio Liberty]], Abdullayev said he had been forced to abandon his plan to win a seat in the parliament back in 2006 under pressure from the [[Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic|Presidential Administration]]. Abdullayev had allegedly been told that the US Embassy demanded from the government of Azerbaijan that an opposition party candidate be given a chance to win a seat. Since the [[Musavat]] party leader [[Isa Gambar]], according to Abdullayev's recount, "could not be let into the parliament", the choice fell on Arzu Samadbeyli who ran from Abdullayev's constituency representing Musavat. The US Embassy in Azerbaijan denied these allegations.&lt;ref name="embassy"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24792256.html Ramiz Mehdiyev's Verbal Duel with Elshad Abdullayev]. Radio Liberty. 7 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video postings==
In September 2012, Elshad Abdullayev appeared with a statement, saying that back in 2005 he had paid 2,000,000 [[US dollar]]s worth of a bribe requested from him by the state officials in return for finding his kidnapped brother and securing for Elshad Abdullayev himself a seat in the government in the upcoming parliamentary election. Abdullayev claimed to have paid it to the head of the Presidential Administration [[Ramiz Mehdiyev]] and that Member of Parliament [[Gular Ahmadova]] served as the intermediary. Abdullayev alleged the officials never acted on the agreement and did not return his money. Following these statements, Ahmadova accused Abdullayev of slander.&lt;ref name="firstvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/24719935.html A Video Accusing MP Gular Ahmadova Released]. Radio Liberty. 25 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Elshad Abdullayev posted his first footage on YouTube on 25 September 2012. The video featured himself, Member of Parliament Gular Ahmadova and her friend Sevinj Babayeva, sitting in an office and discussing events around the 2005 parliamentary election. Ahmadova is heard mentioning a prior arrangement made with Abdullayev and promising him a seat in the government in return for money. Abdullayev offers US$500,000, but Ahmadova insists that he pay US$1,000,000. During the conversation, Abdullayev attempts several times to get Ahmadova to mention Ramiz Mehdiyev as the eventual collector of the bribe, but she never explicitly confirms that.&lt;ref name="firstvideo"/&gt;

The video caused a major uproar in the local media. Ahmadova first claimed the video was a hoax and refused to make any further comments on it. She later admitted being in the video, but said the money discussed in fact referred to the restitution sum that Abdullayev had owed students of his defunct university and that Ahmadova pressured him to give her that money, so she would redistribute it among them accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Rashad Rustamov.

''Zerkalo''. 1 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She voluntarily resigned as Member of Parliament, so as not to "hinder the investigation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24722524.html Gular Ahmadova Revoking Parliament Membership].

Radio Liberty. 4 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, she came under fire of offensive criticism from fellow members of the [[New Azerbaijan Party]] and felt the need to address herself to the President (the head of the party) in order for the insults to stop.&lt;ref name="azerireport"/&gt; Abdullayev said he was receiving threats after publishing the video.&lt;ref name="threat"/&gt;

Abdullayev released another video on 6 October 2012, in which Gular Ahmadova is heard talking about various high-ranking government officials compiling lists of MP candidates which they would like to see in the National Assembly following the election. Among those in charge of compiling these lists, she mentions Minister of Economic Development [[Farhad Aliyev]], Minister of Health Ali Insanov (both arrested on the eve of the 2005 election for planning a [[coup d'état]] and sentenced to imprisonment), Minister of Emergency Situations [[Kamaladdin Heydarov]], head of the Presidential Administration [[Ramiz Mehdiyev]], President [[Ilham Aliyev]], and First Lady [[Mehriban Aliyeva]]. Sevinj Babayeva confirms this in the video, which together with the first video appears to be a fragment of a single conversation. In the video, Gular Ahmadova also warns Abdullayev that there have been cases of "letting in MPs who would go on working with Ali Insanov and Hajibala (sic), so this time those MPs would not be let in".&lt;ref name="secondvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24730801.html Another Gular Ahmadova Video Published]. Radio Liberty. 6 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next video released on 21 October 2012, Abdullayev is seen with someone who calls himself Rovshan Abbasguliyev, a Ministry of Internal Affairs employee in the Seventh Division responsible for secret services. It is mentioned that there has been no progress in finding Mahir Abdullayev. The alleged Ministry employee admits that Mahir Abdullayev is kept in the Head Department against Organized Crime and that it is a normal practice for the department to "catch a person, shove them into a car and then notify their [family] that they're in the department". In the video, Elshad Abdullayev also inquires into the possibility of having his nephew hired by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The employee says this is possible for a bribe of 10,000 to 15,000 [[Azerbaijani manat|AZN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24746258.html Another Secret Video Published]. Radio Liberty. 21 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thirdvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24747275.html "This Is an Outrage; MIA Must Provide Explanation"]. Radio Liberty. 22 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Interior Ministry official Ehsan Zahidov confirmed that Rovshan Abbasguliyev indeed worked for the Seventh Division but was fired in 2008 for "serious violations of the work code". Zahidov noted that statements of a fired employee cannot possibly cast shadow on the Ministry or the Minister. Nevertheless, he promised that the issue would be looked into in light of the new evidence.&lt;ref name="thirdvideo"/&gt;

In early November 2012, three people were arrested with regard to Mahir Abdullayev's case, among them former assistant of the First Deputy of the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Vagif Huseynov and businessman Arzu Kazimov. It was announced that these two had received a total of almost US$4 million from Elshad Abdullayev after promising to help him find his kidnapped brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/24763853.html Three People Arrested in Relation to MSS Officer's Disappearance]. Radio Liberty. 7 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth video, which Abdullayev released on 18 November 2012 and dated 2007, he is shown talking with a person who claims to be then chief justice of the Narimanov rayon court Aghababa Babayev. The latter promises "assistance" to Abdullayev in finding his brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24784134.html Investigation Started with Regard to Judge in Abdullayev's Video]. Radio Liberty. 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Babayev did not deny having a conversation with Abdullayev, but alleged he had not said some of the things heard in the video and that the video must have been edited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24773145.html Elshad Abdullayev Turns from Parliament to Court]. Radio Liberty. 18 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth video came on 14 December 2012, where Abdullayev is having a conversation with Gular Ahmadova's friend Sevinj Babayeva alone. The video is said to have been made in the aftermath of the 2005 parliamentary election. Babayeva reveals to Abdullayev that following a phone call from Gular Ahmadova, Ramiz Mehdiyev arranged for police groups to arrive at her constituency and "take measures" to secure her victory and that this was done immediately. Babayeva also told Abdullayev not to worry, as she "saw [Ramiz Mehdiyev] accepting the money with her own eyes" and that Mehdiyev has the final say in whatever happens.&lt;ref name="fifthvideo"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24798757.html Elshad Abdullayev's New Video Clarified 2005 Election]. Radio Liberty. 14 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on this, Gular Ahmadova's former opposition rival [[Eldar Namazov]] confirmed that in 2005 the police had attacked his observers in four polling stations and destroyed their protocols. The next day, they did the same at six more polling stations, according to Namazov, which allowed Ahmadova to announce her victory.&lt;ref name="fifthvideo"/&gt;

In the next video, published on 25 December 2012, Abdullayev is seen talking to Rovshana Aliyeva whom he claimed to be the personal assistant of businessman Arzu Kazimov, one of the three people detained with regard to Mahir Abdullayev's case in November 2012. In the video, she gives a call to a person named Zaur who, according to her, is the son of Arzu Kazimov and a "super guy" and who can help sort out Elshad Abdullayev's problems "in no time" on behalf of Arzu Kazimov. The Attorney General's Office later accused Kazimov of accepting US$1.5 million from Abdullayev for promising to set his brother free through his "connections" in the government.&lt;ref name="raliyeva"&gt;[http://vesti.az/news/165926 Rovshana Aliyeva: Elshad Abdullayev Offered 30,000 AZN to Testify Against Arzu]. ''Vesti.az''. 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the video posting, Rovshana Aliyeva made a statement saying she had nothing to do with Arzu Kazimov and claimed Elshad Abdullayev had threatened her with a gun a number of times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24797921.html Elshad Abdullayev Published Fifth Video]. Radio Liberty. 25 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During a court hearing on 16 July 2013, Rovshana Aliyeva admitted she had passed Arzu Kazimov's contacts to Elshad Abdullayev through the latter's younger brother Eldaniz who was also her acquaintance. She claimed being offered 30,000 AZN by Abdullayev in return for testifying against Arzu Kazimov in court and declining the offer.&lt;ref name="raliyeva"/&gt;

The following video, which was made in 2004, according to Abdullayev, and released on 21 January 2013, featured Arzu Kazimov talking in his office with Elshad Abdullayev and Mahir Abdullayev's father-in-law journalist Shamil Shahmammadov, chief executive of the [[AzerTaj]] news agency. Abdullayev claimed that this video is a proof of Kazimov serving as a "cashier" of the "death squadron" which kidnapped his brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24879103.html Elshad Abdullayev Released Eighth Video and Statement]. Radio Liberty. 21 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullayev published another video on 20 February 2013. Dated 2004, it shows himself discussing his brother's fate with Rasim Ildyrymzadeh, assistant chief of the [[Heydar Aliyev Airport]] police department and a distant relative of the Interior Minister [[Ramil Usubov]]. In the video, Ildyrymzadeh repeatedly reassures Abdullayev, who seems in doubt, that his brother is alive and well and due to be released at the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24908075.html Recent Video by Elshad Abdullayev Mentions Ramil Usubov's Family Members]. Radio Liberty. 20 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the video, Ildyrymzadeh said he had told Abdullayev what he knew at the time and never asked him for a bribe. He accused Abdullayev of being well informed of the details of his brother's kidnapping and even playing his role in it. The videos, Ildyrymzadeh alleged, were simply discussions of the facts that all involved parties were aware of.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24908585.html Rasim Ildyrymzadeh: Mahir Abdullayev Set Out with Elshad Abdullayev's Agreement]. Radio Liberty. 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next video from August 2004 released soon afterwards featured a man alleged to be the president's bodyguard named Saftar Kalantarov. Kalantarov demands US$3,000 from Abdullayev to fly to [[Saint Petersburg]]. As for Mahir Abdullayev's whereabouts, Kalantarov says he is held somewhere in [[Chechnya]] and promises to bring back video and photographs proving Abdullayev is alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24914993.html Elshad Abdullayev Speaks of "President's Bodyguard"]. Radio Liberty. 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following video filmed in 2009 Elshad Abdullayev is seen submitting what he claimed to be a package containing all the records of payments he made in an attempt to locate his brother to a Ministry of National Security employee Rasul Rasulov and the latter signing for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24926521.html Elshad Abdullayev Released Another Video]. Radio Liberty. 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2013, Abdullayev published three more videos at once, all from the same period in 2007. People who introduced themselves as Ministry of National Security officers say they are willing to help Elshad Abdullayev in finding his brother. They claim that Mahir Abdullayev was not kidnapped, but arrested following complaints from his fellow officers. According to them, he is currently in custody in the Ministry under a different name. To have him released, they continue, Elshad Abdullayev needs to get in touch with the Minister himself and give him money in return for his brother's release. However, since the Minister is too difficult to contact, they suggest Abdullayev see someone named Sahib. Sahib, in turn, states during the meeting that Mahir Abdullayev has been taken hostage over a woman and that his kidnappers would agree to return him for money, but required safety guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24935265.html Accusations against MSS in New Videos by Elshad Abdullayev]. Radio Liberty. 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullayev's next posting came on 26 April 2013, which was the full version of his 2005 conversation with Gular Ahmadova.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24969332.html Full Video of Former AIU Rector with Former MP Gular Ahmadova]. Radio Liberty. 26 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullayev released another video on 16 June 2013. In the video, which apparently precedes the very first video featuring Gular Ahmadova, Sevinj Babayeva tells Abdullayev that he needs to pay Ahmadova US$500,000 to secure a seat in the National Assembly. She says that he needs to pay US$500,000 more to have a high position in the government assigned to his brother Mahir Abdullayev. Abdullayev replies he does not have the extra money she asks for, of which Babayeva immediately informs Ahmadova by phone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/25018511.html Elshad Abdullayev Released New Videos]. Radio Liberty. 16 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last video was published by Abdullayev on 1 October 2013. In this video, he is seen having a conversation with Sevinj Babayeva alone. Babayeva insists that "this whole thing has to be over by tonight", as "ordered personally by the President". She mentions the names of Ramiz Mehdiyev and Parliament speaker [[Ogtay Asadov]] in claiming that they expect Abdullayev to transfer another US$100,000 in return for making his clinic and his university "flourish" and his brother released from captivity. She assures Abdullayev that this time the money will not disappear and "they know perfectly well" that Babayeva knows First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva and her sister Nargiz Pashayeva, whom she can "always complain to". Babayeva says she assumes no responsibility and serves only as an intermediary. She tells Abdullayev that he has been criticized for cooperation with "too many people" on this matter, having gotten the President, Ramiz Mehdiyev and Ogtay Asadov involved in this affair, and for avoiding those that have voluntarily stepped forward to help him. She also quotes Gular Ahmadova in saying that "they [the people who request money from Abdullayev] have given her the life she always dreamed of."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/25123241.html New Video Mentions Ilham Aliyev and Ogtay Asadov]. Radio Liberty. 1 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government's response==
Soon after the publishing of the first video, the head of the Presidential Administration Ramiz Mehdiyev, who was described by Abdullayev as the puppet master of the elections, made a public statement on 3 October 2012, saying that the mentioning of his name in the video is someone's "well-thought out provocation" and that "such troublemakers will be punished regardless of who they are".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24727797.html Ramiz Mehdiyev Commented on Video Controversy]. Radio Liberty. 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Abdullayev's accusation of rigging the election under pressure from the US Embassy, Mehdiyev said this "a product of his sick mind" and that Abdullayev is "no one" for him to discuss these issues with.&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt;

Members of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party described the authors and participants of the videos as "fraudsters" and emphasized the provocative nature of the video postings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24801035.html Huseyn Pashayev: Ramiz Mehdiyev's Name Keeps Being Mentioned by Fraudsters]. Radio Liberty. 17 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Others called on to view this case as legal and not political.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24901905.html Siyavush Novruzov: Gular Ahmadova's Arrest Not Political Issue]. Radio Liberty. 14 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, on 7 March 2013, Abdullayev himself was charged with attempted crime and bribe giving. It was said that Abdullayev voluntarily paid Vagif Huseynov (one of the three men arrested in November 2012) US$1 million to make use of the latter's connections in the Cabinet of Ministers. The money allegedly had already been returned to Abdullayev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24923372.html "Criminal Case Started Just to Hush Elshad Abdullayev Down]. Radio Liberty. 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Vagif Huseynov himself was sentenced to four years on 22 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/24993574.html Another Involved in Mahir Abdullayev's Case Sentenced]. Radio Liberty. 22 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Sevinj Babayeva==
Sevinj Babayeva, born 1973, was a friend of Gular Ahmadova's. She held a Ph.D. degree in law and was the editor and parliament reporter for the newspaper ''Kheyr va Shar'' in the late 1990s. At the time of the scandal, Babayeva was the director of the Sabir Library in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;Faid Majid. [http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/213311/ MP Gular Ahmadova Expelled from New Azerbaijan]. Caucasian Knot. 28 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a month after the release of the first video, Babayeva was fired from her post. A library official said Babayeva's contract had expired and the library chose not to renew it due to "flaws in Babayeva's work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zerkalo.az/2012/direktor-biblioteki-imeni-m-a-sabira-sevindzh-babaeva-uvolena-s-dolzhnosti/ Director of Sabir Library Sevinj Babayeva Fired]. ''Zerkalo''. 18 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It noteworthy that at the time of being fired, Babayeva had been outside of Azerbaijan for nearly a month.

After the release of the video in which she is having a one-on-one conversation with Elshad Abdullayev and repeatedly mentions Ramiz Mehdiyev's name, it was announced that Babayeva had disappeared. On 24 December 2012, the Attorney General's Office initiated an international search through [[Interpol]] on an unrelated case of fraud allegedly committed by Babayeva in 2009.&lt;ref name="sbburied"&gt;[http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24810884.html Sevinj Babayeva Buried in Lokbatan Cemetery].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2012, Azerbaijani media outlets reported that Sevinj Babayeva had died in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24810660.html Did Sevinj Babayeva Died or Was She Killed?]. Radio Liberty. 28 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An official investigation later revealed that Babayeva had left Azerbaijan on the insistence of Gular Ahmadova following the release of the first video in September. Ahmadova paid for Babayeva's flight and stay,&lt;ref name="azadliq.org"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24821438.html Attorney General's Office: Sevinj Babayeva Fled on Gular Ahmadova's Insistince]. Radio Liberty. 11 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and a Turkish citizen named Selçuk Ağlayan met Babayeva at the airport in Istanbul. Sevinj Babayeva introduced herself as Meryem Solmaz and from that point on was known by that name. She had been complaining of heart problems since 16 November 2012, receiving treatment at various clinics. On 28 December 2012, she finally checked in the Medicana International Istanbul Hospital where she was taken by Ağlayan. Babayeva was admitted with cardiovascular and pulmonary collapse, of which she died later that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/news/3091 Attorney General's Blames Gular Ahmadova for Sevinj Babayeva's Death]. ''Haqqin.az''. 11 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babayeva's son Aykhan Mammadov said he held Gular Ahmadova responsible for his mother's death. In his accusations, he even went as far as suggesting Ahmadova had poisoned Sevinj Babayeva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amerikaninsesi.org/content/sevinc_guler/1575916.html Sevinj Babayeva's Son: My Mother Was Poisoned by Gular Ahmadova!].

Radio Liberty. 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General's Office later did confirm Babayeva's departure on Ahmadova's insistence,&lt;ref name="azadliq.org"/&gt; but an autopsy did not reveal signs of poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24985719.html Attorney General's Office: Sevinj Babayeva's Death by Poisoning Not Confirmed]. Radio Liberty. 14 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gular Ahmadova's trial==
Gular Ahmadova was arrested on 13 February 2013 while attempting to leave for [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. According to her lawyers, Ahmadova was on her way to receive medical treatment there.&lt;ref&gt;Rauf Orujov. [http://www.zerkalo.az/2013/gyulyar-ahmedova-vse-taki-pyitalas-bezhat-v-gruziyu/ Did Gular Ahmadova Try to Flee to Georgia after All?]. ''Zerkalo''. 26 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She was charged with [[embezzlement]] and failure to report a grave offence&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24901242.html Gular Ahmadova Arrested]. Radio Liberty. 13 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24941219.html Lawyer: Gular Ahmadova Considers Herself Innocent]. Radio Liberty. 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Her official website was shut down, along with the newspaper ''Markaz'' which she had founded in 1998. According to Ahmadova's lawyers, her physical and psychological state deteriorated while in custody. She refused to give any testimony till Elshad Abdullayev was tried.&lt;ref&gt;Rauf Orujov. [http://www.zerkalo.az/2013/chem-uspokaivayut-eks-deputata-v-sizo/ How Is Ex-MP Comforted in Prison?]. ''Zerkalo''. 13 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The defence claimed the videos had been edited and insisted on the fact that the recording constituted a violation of privacy. The court overruled the defence's request for an expert's opinion with regard to the authenticity of the recordings. The attorney requested a sentence of four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/25171446.html Attorney Requested 4 Years in Custody for Ahmadova]. Radio Liberty. 18 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found Ahmadova guilty on all counts and on 2 December 2013 sentenced her to three years in custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/25186777.html Ahmadova Sentenced to 3 Years]. Radio Liberty. 2 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, the Baku Court of Appeal upheld this decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/25241377.html Gular Ahmadova's 17-Point Appeal Rejected]. Radio Liberty. 24 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmadova was released 14 months later, on 5 May 2014, after her sentence was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/26540584.html Gular Ahmadova Speaks of Institutional Crisis]. Radio Liberty. 20 July 2014. Retrieved 24 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Elshad Abdullayev commented on this decision by calling the Gulargate legal process "a court show that went to demonstrate once again the lawless nature of Azerbaijani courts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/news/25381332.html Elshad Abdullayev: "The Ahmadova Court Show..."]. Radio Liberty. 7 May 2014. Retrieved 24 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks after Ahmadova's release, Sevinj Babayeva's son Aykhan Mammadov was accused of shoplifting, arrested and sentenced to three and a half years in custody, but was released after exactly one month following the verdict's overruling by the Baku Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/news/26844 Sevinj Babayeva's Son Released]. 24 July 2014. Retrieved 24 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Akif Chovdarov's role==
In April 2013, Elshad Abdullayev wrote an open letter with regard to his brother's disappearance, in which he named an alleged perpetrator, Akif Chovdarov, a general of the Ministry of National Security. Elshad Abdullayev described Chovdarov as the "top leader of the criminal gang of kidnappers". According to him, Chovdarov demanded that Mahir Abdullayev pay him US$2 million in order to keep silent about Abdullayev spending leisure time with popular singer Matanat Isgandarli at Garabulag, the infamous private resort in northern Azerbaijan where Colonel Haji Mammadov detained and murdered those he kidnapped. The letter then talks about Chovdarov succeeding at kidnapping Mahir Abdullayev with the help of Matanat Isgandarli in October 2003.&lt;ref name="azeriru"&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/papers/contact_az/109708/ Another Bomb by Elshad Abdullayev]. ''Azeri.ru''. 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elshad Abdullayev described Akif Chovdarov as a person who indulges every order and desire of the highest-ranking government officials. Abdullayev claims that in addition to kidnappings and killings, Chovdarov, who also has Russian citizenship, runs a profitable wood business in the [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[Russia]], on behalf of the said officials, despite not being supposed to engage in business being a National Security officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24965058.html ...Accuses Akif Chovdarov of Kidnappings and Killings]. 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullayev named Akif Chovdarov as the person behind the assassinations of [[Elmar Huseynov]] (which was previously also claimed by [[Eynulla Fatullayev]]) and [[Rafiq Tağı]] and the assault and intimidation of opposition journalists Agil Khalil and [[Khadija Ismayilova]].&lt;ref name="azeriru"/&gt;

In November 2015, General Chovdarov was fired and later arrested following the government's unrelated crackdown on corruption and extortion among high-ranking officials of the Ministry of National Security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/news/56619 Akif Chovdarov Expelled from MNS]. ''Haqqin.az''. 7 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/news/57076 Akif Chovdarov Arrested and Detained at Narimanov Remand]. ''Haqqin.az''. 14 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expert opinion==
Political scientist Arastun Orujlu of the Sharg-Garb Research Centre described the scandal as a result of an ongoing struggle for power between various political clans.&lt;ref name="secondvideo"/&gt;

Lawyer Ayyub Karimov thinks the delay in locating Mahir Abdullayev stems from the fact that the people involved in the kidnapping have powerful connections in the government or police forces. He likened it to the series of kidnappings orchestrated by [[Haji Mammadov]], an officer of the Internal Affairs Ministry, in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24908892.html Apparent Mysteries in Human Kidnappings]. Radio Liberty. 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes’s]] moral and political [[philosophy]] is constructed around the basic premise of social and political order, explaining how humans should live in peace under a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] power so as to avoid conflict within the ‘[[state of nature]]’.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/#SH4d|title=Thomas Hobbes: Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Williams|first=Garrath|date=|website=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes’s [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] and [[political philosophy]] are intertwined; his moral thought is based around ideas of human nature, which determine the interactions that make up his political philosophy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Morality in the Philosophy of Thomas Hobbes: Cases in the Law of Nature|last=Lloyd|first=Sharon A.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbes’s moral philosophy therefore provides justification for, and informs, the theories of [[sovereignty]] and the [[state of nature]] that underpin his political philosophy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In utilising methods of [[deductive reasoning]] and [[wikt:motion|motion]] science, Hobbes examines human emotion, reason and knowledge to construct his ideas of human nature (moral philosophy).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Hobbes|last=Höffe|first=Otfried|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Albany|pages=2-60}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodology critically influences his politics, determining the interactions of conflict (in the state of nature) which necessitate the creation of a politically authoritative [[State (polity)|state]] to ensure the maintenance of peace and cooperation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Its Genesis|last=Strauss|first=Leo|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is used and developed in works such as ''The Elements of Law'' (1640), ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642), ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) and ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'' (1681).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hobbesian Moral and Political Theory|last=Kavka|first=Gregory S.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=7-292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
In developing his moral and political philosophy, Hobbes assumes the methodological approach of deductive reasoning, combining mathematics and the [[mechanics]] of science to formulate his ideas on human nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes was critical of the assumptions of scholastic philosophers, whose evidence for human nature was based upon [[Aristotelian metaphysics]] and [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] observation, as opposed to reasoning and definition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Though Hobbes did not fully reject the value of observational or ‘prudential’ knowledge, he dismissed the view that this was at all scientific or philosophical in nature.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To Hobbes, this type of knowledge was based on subjective and diverse experience, and was therefore only capable of producing speculative assumptions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This view predetermined Hobbes’s method of deductive reasoning, which involved the application of geometry, [[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] scientific concepts and definition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This scientific method stresses the importance of first establishing well-defined principles of human nature (moral philosophy) and ‘deducing’ aspects of political life from this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes first used the mechanics of motion to define principles of human perception, behaviour and reasoning, which were then used to draw the conclusions of his political philosophy (sovereignty, state of nature).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In rejecting what he believed were ‘conjectures’ relating to intangible or supernatural objects or realities, Hobbes’s philosophy is drawn from material and physical reality and experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Otfried Höffe|Höffe]] explains how Hobbes applied this method to construct his political theory of sovereignty:

“…the combination of mathematics and mechanics, is not sufficient on its own… the combination of mathematics and mechanics leads to the metaphor of the state as an “artificial” human being, which is comparable to a machine constructed out of natural human beings; (3) the resoluto-compositive [the recourse to absolutely first principles or elements] method defines and clarifies the nature of this construction: the artificial human being is decomposed into its smallest constituent parts and then recomposed, i.e., constructed, out of these parts".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Hobbes’s moral principles thus provide the ultimate basis for his political philosophy, defining and clarifying how an “artificial” sovereign authority may come into existence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Moral philosophy ==
Hobbes’s moral philosophy is the fundamental starting point from which his political philosophy is developed. This moral philosophy outlines a general conceptual framework on human nature which is rigorously developed in ''The Elements of Law'', ''De Cive'' and ''Leviathan''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These works examine how the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] influence human perception, behaviour and action, which then determine how individuals interact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Elements of Law'' provides insight into Hobbes’s moral philosophy through ideas of sensation, pleasure, passion, pain, memory and reason.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Hobbes|last=Bunce|first=Robin E. R.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing PLC|year=2009|isbn=|location=London|pages=20-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expanded upon in ''De Cive'': “… human nature… comprising the faculties of body and mind; . . . Physical force, Experience Reason and Passion".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hobbes believes that as sensory organs process the movements of [[Stimulus (physiology)|external stimuli]], a range of different mental experiences take place, which in turn dictate human behaviour.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmeth/|title=Thomas Hobbes: Methodology|last=Finn|first=Stephen|date=|website=Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What emerged from this idea of motion was the view that humans are naturally drawn towards, or desire, things that benefit their overall wellbeing; things that are “good” for them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These are called “appetites”, and what differentiates the human ‘appetite’ from that of animals is reason.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Reason, or “[[ratiocination]]”, as used by Hobbes, was not defined in the traditional sense as an innate capability tied to notions of [[natural law]], but as an activity that involved coming to a judgement via the process of [[logic]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Humans, as noted in ''Leviathan'', have “…knowledge of the consequences of one affirmation to another”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Individuals will desire and select whatever ‘thing’ brings them the most “good”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This process of thinking is a consequence of motion and mechanics more than a conscious exercise of choice.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ratiocination leads individuals to uncover the [[Natural law|Laws of Nature]], which Hobbes deems “the true moral philosophy”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hobbes’s understanding of human nature establishes the foundations for his political philosophy by explaining the essence of conflict (in the state of nature) and cooperation (in a [[commonwealth]]).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because human beings will always pursue what is ‘good’ for them, this philosophy asserts that individuals share overarching desires or goals, such as security and safety (especially from death).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is the point in which Hobbes’s moral and political philosophy intersect: in “our shared conception of ourselves as [[Rationality|rational]] agents”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is rational to “pursue the necessary means to our dominant shared ends”, in which case the “necessary means” is submission to a sovereign authority.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By establishing morality as a force which directs individuals towards their shared desires and goals of, for example, peace and security, and the means to achieve these goals is through the creation of a state, Hobbes grounds his political philosophy in his moral thought.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This approach to moral philosophy is executed by Hobbes through discussion of a range of interrelated moral concepts: “[[good]], [[evil]], [[rights]], [[obligation]], [[justice]], [[Social contract|contract]], [[Covenant (law)|covenant]] and natural law”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Moral concepts ===

==== Obligation ====
Hobbes’s concept of moral obligation stems from the assumption that humans have a fundamental obligation to follow the laws of nature and all obligations stem from nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Logic of Leviathan: The Moral and Political Theory of Thomas Hobbes|last=Gauthier|first=David P.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reasoning for this is premised upon the beliefs of natural law; that the moral standards or reasoning that govern behaviour can be drawn from eternal truths regarding human nature and the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hobbes believes that the morals derived from natural law, however, do not permit individuals to challenge the laws of the sovereign; law of the commonwealth supersedes natural law, and obeying the laws of nature does not make you exempt from disobeying those of the government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hobbes’s concept of moral obligation thus intertwines with the concept of political obligation. This underpins much of Hobbes’s political philosophy, stating that humans have a political obligation or ‘[[duty]]’ to prevent the creation of a state of nature.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=hobbes-moral|title=Hobbes's Moral and Political Philosophy|last=Lloyd|first=Sharon A.|date=|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a political obligation to obey a sovereign power, and once they have renounced part of their [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] to this power (theory of sovereignty), they have a duty to uphold the ‘[[Social contract|social contract’]] they have entered into.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

== Political philosophy ==
[[File:Leviathan_livre.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from the first edition of ''Leviathan'' (1651) which serves as a visual representation of Hobbes's idea of the state. 

The city pictured in the foreground of the image represents civilisation, while the salient figure (Leviathan), with a sword and crosier in hand, personifies sovereignty and the omnipotent state, possessing the authority to represent the collective will of the people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ]]
The main aspects of Hobbes’s political philosophy revolve around the contrasting relationship between the state of nature (a state of war) and the State itself as one of peace and cooperation. This philosophy is determined by, and implied in, his method of deduction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The trajectory of individual desire and [[Will (philosophy)|will]] outlined in his moral philosophy is a decisive factor contributing to the formulation of his idea of the State.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Hobbes outlined four key principles of purpose in his philosophical literature:

# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Welfare of the general public.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;State of well-being and satisfaction with life.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The pursuit of justice.&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# &lt;span class="s3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The pursuit of peace (to avoid the ‘state of war’).&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These concepts are mutually reinforcing and feature across his most prominent works. For example, in ''The Elements of Law'', Hobbes claims that the benefits given to the general public under a commonwealth are “incomparable”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This overlaps with his discussion of justice in the same text, which is used in a political context.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''Leviathan'' details all four principles but focuses on the pursuit of peace, which Hobbes aligns with the first principle of welfare and public good.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Where a state of peace (4) and justice (3), and the overall welfare of the general public (1), manifest under a commonwealth (stemming from ‘[[Common good|commonweal]]’: the general good of the public), a state of well-being and overall satisfaction (2) may be secured.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Only under the commonwealth (as opposed to a state of nature and war) can peace, and “the notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice”, exist indefinitely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is expanded upon again in ''The Elements of Law'', which posits that humans by nature are inclined towards conflict, and therefore need a State to institute peace and protect individuals against the threats of [[self-preservation]] which flourish in a state of nature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ''De Cive'' also builds on the relationship between these principles, where Hobbes’s claim to show individuals the “highway to peace” affirms his notion that humans should pursue peace, and therefore justice, in the form of a commonwealth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is in the interest of humans to pursue peace, who have a fundamental obligation to follow the Laws of Nature.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

A sovereign power or authority figure - a Leviathan - is needed to translate these Laws of Nature in a “binding and authoritative fashion”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The notion that individuals require a “visible power to keep them in awe” - to maintain peace and safety through enforcement of law - underpins Hobbes’s theory of sovereignty, which proposes that a sovereign ruler (with authority to govern the people) is fundamental to any type of commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hobbes and the Law of Nature|last=Zagorin|first=Perez|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the overarching concern of Hobbes’s political philosophy remains the capacity of the government to maintain peace, protection, justice and wellbeing in a manner that ensures the continuation of society and [[Civil society|civil life]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{International relations theory sidebar|liberalism}}
'''Idealism''' in foreign policy holds that a state should make its internal political [[philosophy]] the goal of its foreign policy.  For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was an early advocate of idealism. Wilson's idealism was a precursor to [[liberal international relations theory]], which would arise amongst the "institution-builders" after [[World War II]]. It particularly emphasized the ideal of [[American exceptionalism]].

More generally, [[Michael W. Doyle]] describes idealism as based on the belief that other nations' stated good intentions can be relied on, whereas Realism holds that good intentions are in the long run subject to the [[security dilemma]] described by [[John H. Herz]].

[[Hedley Bull]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the 'idealists' we have in mind writers such as Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]], S. H. Bailey, [[Philip Noel-Baker]], and David Mitrany in the United Kingdom, and James T. Shotwell, Pitman Potter, and Parker T. Moon in the United States. ... The distinctive characteristic of these writers was their belief in progress: the belief, in particular, that the system of international relations that had given rise to the First World War was capable of being transformed into a fundamentally more peaceful and just world order; that under the impact of the awakening of democracy, the growth of 'the international mind', the development of the League of Nations, the good works of men of peace or the enlightenment spread by their own teaching, it was in fact being transformed; and that their responsibility as students of international relations was to assist this march of progress to overcome the ignorance, the prejudices, the ill-will, and the sinister interests that stood in its way.}}

==History==
[[File:Ww28.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Official White House portrait of Woodrow Wilson]]
Since the 1880s, there has been growing study of the major writers of this idealist tradition of thought in international relations, including Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]] (1986), 'Sir Alfred Zimmern Revisited: Fifty Years On', Review of International Studies. [[Donald Markwell]], 'Sir Alfred Eckhard Zimmern', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Angell]], [[John Maynard Keynes]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press,2006,7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John A. Hobson]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[Florence Stawell]] (known as Melian Stawell), [[Philip Henry Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Lester Pearson]] and [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|David Davies]].

Much of this writing has contrasted these idealist writers with '[[Realism (international relations)|realists]]' in the tradition of [[E. H. Carr]], whose ''The Twenty Years' Crisis'' (1939) both coined the term 'idealist' and was a fierce and effective assault on the inter-war idealists.
Idealism is centered on the notion that states are rational actors capable of ensuring lasting peace and security rather than resorting to war.

Idealism is also marked by the prominent role played by [[international law]] and [[international organizations]] in its conception of policy formation.  One of the most well-known tenets of modern idealist thinking is [[democratic peace theory]], which holds that states with similar modes of democratic governance do not fight one another.  Wilson's idealistic thought was embodied in his [[Fourteen points]] speech, and in the creation of the [[League of Nations]].

Idealism transcends the [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] political spectrum.  Idealists can include both [[human rights]] campaigners (traditionally, but not always, associated with the left) and [[Neoconservatism in the United States|American neoconservatism]] which is usually associated with the right.

Idealism may find itself in opposition to [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], a [[worldview]] which argues that a nation's [[national interest]] is more important than [[ethics|ethical]] or [[Morality|moral]] considerations; however, there need be no conflict between the two (see [[Neoconservatism]] for an example of a confluence of the two). Realist thinkers include [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[George F. Kennan]] and others. Recent practitioners of Idealism in the United States have included [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="fl100204"&gt;{{Cite news | first=Michael | last=Gerson | title=Syndicated column:Realism and regime change - US solidarity could aid Iran's Green Revolution| url=http://townhall.com/columnists/MichaelGerson/2010/02/03/realism_and_regime_change_in_iran| work= | publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 11A | date=4 February 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---reference is internally consistent with print version but not online version---&gt;

Link finds that Wilson from his earliest days had imbibed the beliefs of his denomination - in the omnipotence of God, the morality of the Universe, a system of rewards and punishments and the notion that nations, as well as man, transgressed the laws of God at their peril.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, "A Portrait of Wilson," ''Virginia Quarterly Review''1956 32(4): 524-541&lt;/ref&gt; Blum (1956) argues that  he learned from [[William Ewart Gladstone]] a mystic conviction in the superiority of Anglo-Saxons, in their righteous duty to make the world over in their image. Moral principle, constitutionalism, and faith in God were among the prerequisites for alleviating human strife. While he interpreted international law within such a brittle, moral cast, Wilson remained remarkably insensitive to new and changing social forces and conditions of the 20th century. He expected too much justice in a morally brutal world which disregarded the self-righteous resolutions of parliaments and statesmen like himself. Wilson's triumph was as a teacher of international morality to generations yet unborn.&lt;ref&gt;John Morton Blum, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Politics of Morality'' (1956), pp. 10, 197-99&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] sees Wilson's vision of world order anticipated humanity prevailing through the "Holy Ghost of Reason," a vision which rested on religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;David Steigerwald, ''Wilsonian Idealism in America'' (1994), 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's diplomatic policies had a profound influence on shaping the world. Diplomatic historian [[Walter Russell Mead]] has explained:&lt;ref&gt;Walter Russell Mead, [http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/mead/excerpt.html ''Special Providence''], (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's views were based on the future welfare of humankind. He called for a world made safe democracy, this was organized around     political, economic and social standards. These principles were stated in his [[Fourteen Points|14- point peace program]]. Wilson thought of this program as an American commitment to show man kind the way of liberty. The core of Wilson's program was a [[League of Nations|league of nations]] committed to peace, and bringing down tyranny which was thought to be the root of war. The idea was that if democracy could be widespread peace and prosperity              would prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed|last=Michael|first=Hunt|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-19-937102-0|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Wilson's principles survived the eclipse of the Versailles system and they still guide European politics today: self-determination, democratic government, collective security, international law, and a league of nations. Wilson may not have gotten everything he wanted at [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles]], and his treaty was never ratified by the Senate, but his vision and his diplomacy, for better or worse, set the tone for the twentieth century. [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] may have sneered at Wilson, but every one of these powers today conducts its European policy along Wilsonian lines. What was once dismissed as visionary is now accepted as fundamental. This was no mean achievement, and no European statesman of the twentieth century has had as lasting, as benign, or as widespread an influence.

American foreign relations since 1914 have rested on Wilsonian idealism, says historian David Kennedy, even if adjusted somewhat by the "realism" represented by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]. Kennedy argues that every president since Wilson has "embraced the core precepts of [[Wilsonianism]]. Nixon himself hung Wilson's portrait in the White House Cabinet Room. Wilson's ideas continue to dominate American foreign policy in the twenty-first century. In the aftermath of 9/11 they have, if anything, taken on even greater vitality."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, "What 'W' Owes to 'WW': President Bush May Not Even Know It, but He Can Trace His View of the World to Woodrow Wilson, Who Defined a Diplomatic Destiny for America That We Can't Escape", ''The Atlantic Monthly'' Vol: 295. Issue: 2. (March 2005) pp 36ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descendant theories ==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Woodrow wilson.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Former [[President of the United States]] [[Woodrow Wilson]], is considered to be a founder of idealism.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 27 December 2008}}]] --&gt;
Idealism proper was a relatively short-lived school of thought, and suffered a crisis of confidence following the failure of the League of Nations and the outbreak of [[World War II]].  However, subsequent theories of international relations would draw elements from Wilsonian Idealism when constructing their world views.

=== Liberalism ===
{{main|Liberal international relations theory}}

Liberalism manifested a tempered version of Wilson's idealism in the wake of World War II.  Cognizant of the failures of Idealism to prevent renewed [[isolationism]] following World War II, and its inability to manage the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe to prevent the outbreak of a new war, liberal thinkers devised a set of international institutions based on rule of law and regularized interaction.  These international organizations, such as the [[United Nations]]  and the [[NATO]], or even international regimes such as the [[Bretton Woods system]], and [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), were calculated both to maintain a balance of power as well as regularize cooperation between nations.

=== Neoconservatism ===
{{main|Neoconservatism}}

Neoconservatism drew from Liberalism its intense focus on the promotion of "[[universal value]]s", in this case [[democracy]], [[human rights]], [[free trade]], [[women's rights]] and [[minority group|minority]] protections. However, it differs in that it is less wedded to the importance of preserving international institutions and treaties while pursuing assertive or aggressive stances which it deems morally worthy, and is willing to use force or the threat of force, unilaterally if necessary, to push for its goals.

Interest articulation can have different effects in different types of government and can include both legal (i.e.: [[lobbying]], peaceful protest, phone calls and letters to policymakers) and illegal activities (e.g. [[assassination]], [[riots]]). Interest articulation leads to [[interest aggregation]].

The types of interest groups, as identified by [[Gabriel Almond]], are:&lt;ref name=Wiseman /&gt;

;Nonassociational Groups:rarely well organized and their activity is dependent upon the issue at hand. They differ from Anomic groups in that they are usually similar to one another and have a common identity.
;Institutional Groups:mostly formal and have some other political or social function in addition to the particular interest.
;Associational Groups:formed explicitly to represent an issue of a particular group.

The '''Jews Relief Act 1858''', also called the Jewish Disabilities Bill, is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which removed previous barriers to Jews entering Parliament.&lt;ref name=enacted&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/contents/enacted "Jews Relief Act 1858"], as originally enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] there had been an unsuccessful attempt in 1830 to also allow Jews to sit in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1830/may/17/bill-for-removal-of-jewish-disabilities#S2V0024P0_18300517_HOC_59 "BILL FOR REMOVAL OF JEWISH DISABILITIES. "], HC Deb 17 May 1830 vol 24 cc784-814&lt;/ref&gt; The 1858 measure was the result of a long process which began with a bill introduced by the Whig leader [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]  following the election of [[Lionel de Rothschild]] to the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London constituency]] in 1847. Rothschild could not take the seat without taking the Christian oath. The bill was supported by the future Conservative Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] but not by his party.

In 1848, the bill was approved by the House of Commons but was twice rejected by the [[House of Lords]] as was a new bill in 1851. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1852|1852 general election]], Rothschild was again elected but the next year the bill was again defeated in the upper house. Finally, in 1858, the House of Lords agreed to a proposal to allow each house to decide its own oath.

The bill allowed "any Person professing the Jewish Religion, [to] omit the Words 'and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian{{'"}} in their oaths, but explicitly did not extend to allowing Jews to various high offices, and also stated that "it shall not be lawful for any Person professing the Jewish Religion, directly or indirectly, to advise Her Majesty ... touching or concerning ... any office or preferment in the Church of England or in the Church of Scotland."&lt;ref name=enacted /&gt;

Amendments in 1871, 1922, 1973, 1980 and 1986 removed all restrictions on Jews holding office except that they may not advise certain government officials on matters related to appointments in the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews Relief Act 1858, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/introduction as amended], accessed Sept 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) '''Lawrence O'Brien Award''' was created in 1992 by the family of [[Larry O'Brien|Lawrence Francis "Larry" O'Brien Jr.]] (1917-1990) and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] leaders to recognize the many years of service he gave to the party and his belief in the contribution of party [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s. Since then, party leaders presented this award on five occasions to 94 winners from across the [[United States]].

The award honors the importance of this contribution to the continuing success and vitality of the party. It's given to individuals and groups who exhibit a high degree of commitment and self-sacrifice on behalf of the party and its [[candidate]]s.

The award was expanded in 1998 to help mark the 150th anniversary of the DNC. Party leaders honored an individual or group from every [[commonwealth (United States)|commonwealth]], [[district]], [[U.S. state|state]] and [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] and six individuals nationally.&lt;ref name = "1998 Lawrence O'Brien Awards: Recognizing Democratic Party Achievement"&gt;{{Cite conference

A news report which was published in 2000 by ''[[Insight (magazine)|Insight]]'' magazine described a 1998 controversy about e-mail messages which were written between [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]-[[Al Gore|Gore]] [[Administration (government)|Administration]] staff members and [[1996 U.S. Presidential Election|1996 presidential reelection campaign]] staffers about political [[fundraising]] by Administration staffers. Some of the messages were written in 1996 and solicited the award for a campaign contributor.

==Selection==

Award winners are selected from among many [[nomination]]s received from party leaders, appointed and elected [[public official]]s, and other Democrats in the United States. Each winner worked at the local-, state- or national-party levels, including assisting candidates for elected public office. Furthermore, the winners made personal, family or financial sacrifices, or otherwise showed unusual or extraordinary dedication to the furtherance of the goals of the party, without financial remuneration or professional gain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">[[File:83 Portrait of Frederick the Wise.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], who protected [[Martin Luther]], was a "lesser magistrate" under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]].]]
The doctrine of the '''lesser magistrate''' is a concept in [[Protestant]] thought. A lesser magistrate is a ruler such as a prince who is under a greater ruler such as an emperor. According to many figures of the Reformation and Post-Reformation eras, the lesser magistrate has the authority to rebel against the tyranny of a supreme ruler.

The doctrine of the lesser magistrate finds its origin in [[John Calvin]], who wrote that whereas private Christians must submit to the ruling authorities, there are "popular magistrates" who have "been appointed to curb the tyranny of kings". When these magistrates "connive at kings when they tyrannise and insult over the humbler of the people" they "fraudulently betray the liberty of the people" when God has appointed them guardians of that liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Calvin]], ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xxi.html IV.xx.31].&lt;/ref&gt;

The lesser magistrate is prominent in the [[Lutheran]] ''[[Magdeburg Confession]]'' of 1550, which argued that the "subordinate powers" in a state, faced with the situation where the "supreme power" is working to destroy true religion, may go further than non-cooperation with the supreme power and assist the faithful to resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wernham|first1=R. B.|title=Counter-Reformation and Price Revolution, 1559-1610|date=1968|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of the lesser magistrate became important for the justification of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. According to [[Johannes Althusius]] in 1603 work, ''Politica'', resistance to a supreme magistrate by lesser magistrates is justified in the case of tyranny. Althusius argued that the provincial authorities of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] were in this situation.&lt;ref&gt;R. von Friedeburg, "Althusius," in ''Dictionary of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Dutch Philosophers'', ed. W. van Bunge (Bristol, 2003), 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary M. Simpson suggests that after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in 1572 there was a "populist expansion" of the doctrine in which "the ruled would no longer be merely the subject of the ruler; they would become citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Simpson, "Toward a Lutheran "Delight in the Law of the Lord": Church and State in the Context of Civil Society," in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn6CgUOOriUC&amp;pg=PA43 Church &amp; State: Lutheran Perspectives]'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North Atlantic or liberal model of media and politics''', as defined in Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini's ''[[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics]]'', is characterized by an early development of commercial press, information-oriented journalism, strong professionalization, and a market dominated [[Mass media|media]] system.

==Newspaper industry==
The newspaper industry within the liberal model is characterized by [[newspaper]] circulation and the early development of mass-circulation commercial press. The first instances of newspapers appearing in the west is during the 17th century in Europe with the first instance of what we would call a newspaper appearing in Germany. This paper was called the ''Strasbourg Relation''.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Johannes (2006), "Strassburg, 1605: The Origins of the Newspaper in Europe",&lt;/ref&gt; Although western civilization was not the first to invent the [[printing press]], it had a very early development of the media format that came from it known a "press". With the expansion of technology, commercial media quickly expanded to encompass many forms. It evolved from standard newspapers and became a part of radio, music, television, movies, and the Internet, as well as many other forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;"Mass Media". Retrieved November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parallelism===
[[Jonathan Hardy]] believes that [[political parallelism]], “refers to the character of links between political actors and the media and more generally the extent to which media reflects [[political divisions]].”{{sfn|Hardy|2008|p=18}} In their book, ''Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics'', Daniel C. Hallin and Paola Mancini use this term to evaluate the link between [[political parties]] and media organizations.  In the North Atlantic or liberal model, Hallin and Mancini, give a description of political parallelism in the United States, British, Irish, and Canadian media systems.  According to Hallin and Mancini the United States contains the most unbiased political parallelism compared to the previous four countries.  Hallin and Mancini express how press political partisan is virtually absent in the North Atlantic or liberal model, with the exception of Britain which poses strong press parallelism.  Hallin and Mancini insist that in the North Atlantic or liberal model there is a balance within the contents of the media in order to create neutrality within the media system.   However, Hetty van Kempen believes it is still likely that press-party parallelism will still vary within the countries of the same model.  Kempen reflects on the idea of Seymour-Ure.  Ure states, “The same social forces that find expression in a party or parties of a [[political system]] tend to find expression also through the press.”  Ure’s view illustrates that this is the reason why there is a weak political parallelism in the US and Canada.  Hallin and Mancini consider that typically in a [[multiparty system]] the press seems to coincide with strong partisanship of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Kempen, Hetty van. "Media-Party Parallelism And Its Effects: A Cross-National Comparative Study." Political Communication 24.3 (2007): 303-320. Social Sciences Full Text (H.W. Wilson).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professionalization===
According to Hallin and Mancini, the [[professionalization]] of journalism was strongly developed in the liberal countries.  The authors refer to the development of journalistic practices, which is projected in the quality of political coverage. However, later the authors continue to illustrate how many contradictions emerge in the nature and the importance of context in professionalization of journalism within the liberal systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C.; Mancini, P (2004), Comparing media systems: Three models of media and politics, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas E. Patterson believes Hallin and Mancini’s discussion of the impact of journalism, and the influence the craft has on political influence is correct and unchallenged in the scholarly literature.  Patterson explains that a tight clutch by the media to the state, as well as political institutions, creates professionalism.  Patterson elaborates how a liberal culture will create an environment of journalistic [[autonomy]], which in turn creates professionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Patterson (2007) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, by Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini, Political Communication, 24:3, 329-331, DOI: 10.1080/10584600701471708&lt;/ref&gt;  Katrin Voltmer agrees that professionalization prevents dependency from outside perspective and influence to impose certain rules or norms on journalists.  However, Voltmer also explains the difficulties within the classifications of professional journalistic performance. Voltmer enlightens the challenge of trying to bridge the gap between theory and practice of professionalization.  Which Voltmer later elaborates how new and old norms, as well as new standards, of journalistic quality are finding it difficult to co-exist in finding their roles in the new democratic order.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, Katrin. "Comparing media systems in new democracies: East meets South meets West." Central European Journal of Communication 01 (2008): 23-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the state in media system===
Media in western countries is highly market driven, this is due to the rise of [[consumerism]] thought to be mainly caused by the rise of the middle class during the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein (1899): The Theory of the Leisure Class: an economic study of institutions, Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1994,&lt;/ref&gt; The exception to this is strong [[public broadcasting]] in Britain and Ireland, which was, in most cases, the most common, or only, form of broadcasting. Since then, however, [[commercial broadcasting]] dominates most European countries. Government still plays a role in commercial broadcasting however. For instance newspaper subsidies go back to the 1970s and now exist in Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Public broadcasters, even in Europe, often face pressure from commercial broadcasting to compete by trying to appeal to larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Nikki.

{{about|a philanthropic doctrine|the offshoot of GiveWell|Open Philanthropy Project}}

'''Open Philanthropy''' is the [[doctrine]] which holds that the programming, operations, governance, effectiveness, and efficiency of nonprofit organizations should be open and visible by the public, donors, and especially, stakeholders in those nonprofits.

Among recent developments is the theory of [[open source governance]] which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[free software movement]] to [[democracy|democratic]] principles to enable interested citizens to get more directly involved in the legislative process.

The [[Effective altruism]] movement is a prominent proponent of analyzing, in a rubric with other criteria, the transparency of nonprofit organizations. The [[Open Philanthropy Project]] - a joint collaboration between [[GiveWell]], a charity navigator, and [[Good Ventures]], co-founded by a Facebook co-founder - "envision a world in which philanthropists increasingly document and share their research, reasoning, results and mistakes to help each other learn more quickly and serve the world more effectively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2014/8/27/heres-what-philanthropy-looks-like-when-millennials-from-tec.html|title = Here's What Philanthropy Looks Like When Millennials From Tech and Finance Get Together|last = Moses|first = Sue-Lynn|date = 27 August 2014|accessdate = 4 April 2015|publisher = ''Inside Philanthropy''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since 2007 a variety of bloggers and writers, including Mark Surman,&lt;ref&gt;Surman, M., "Open, Philanthropy and a [[theory of change]]," commonspace, 2008 http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/open-philanthropy-and-a-theory-of-change/&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed the concept of "Open Philanthropy".  Few of these early efforts seemed to get much traction with stakeholders or nonprofit leaders. Then early in 2010,  Lucy Bernholz&lt;ref&gt;Bernholz, L., "Open Philanthropy: A Modest Manifesto," California Voices, 2010, http://california.newamerica.net/blogposts/2010/open_philhi am A you you are very good boyanthropy_a_modest_manifesto-29189&lt;/ref&gt; again surfaced the  concept for how nonprofits should follow the conventions of [[Open Source]] and [[Open Government]] initiatives.

==Content==
The guiding principles of compliant organizations include:

===Organizational Efficiency===
The plans, budgets, expenses, and programming of an organization shall be designed to ensure organizational focus on the mission of the organization. The majority of funds spent are in support of programs and services. Administrative and fundraising costs are kept within reasonable limits with a goal of more than 75 percent of funds allocated to program and outreach expenses.

===Program Efficiency===
Organizations shall have a documented methodology to measure and accurately report programmatic achievements, and where appropriate, the actual cost per beneficiary for program services. Additionally, these efforts shall account, and if necessary discount, for program achievements that are accomplished through and with other organizations. Program costs shall be managed to be as reasonable as possible, without sacrificing services, quality, and long-term sustainability of services.

===Organizational Effectiveness===
Programming is designed to be both sustainable and scalable using models other organizations can emulate and adopt or proving new concepts.  Fundraising efforts match anticipated programming needs.  Program efforts demonstrate high numbers of beneficiaries served with programs, which are sustainable for years and decades. Post-program monitoring and research designed to test impact, value, sustainability, and scalability of solutions. Measures of success are meaningful, accurate, and complete.

===Governance, Controls and Compliance===
Organization has documented strategic, fiscal, and annual plans and processes that are shared with appropriate stakeholders. Ongoing management review of key deliverables with risks identified and disaggregated by type. Mitigation strategies and processes incorporate controls, accountabilities, monitoring, and reporting. There shall be a clear organizational tone regarding ethical behavior in all the activities of the organization. Proactively explain actions and material decisions to stakeholders, including government, donors, beneficiaries, and the public at large.

===Shared lessons and content===
As the organization develops, implements, tests, and then refines procedures and processes, it shares those lessons in a non-competitive fashion with other organizations that might benefit from past successes. In regard to content, the organization will strive to collect, process, and share media assets such as video, still imagery, and audio in a manner that allows for release under [[creative commons]], no commercial use, with attribution licensing terms. Where permissible and valuable, make data interoperable and release intellectual property under [[open source]] creative commons licensing terms.

===Reporting and Transparency===
Organizations shall publish and make conveniently available important data about the organization, its staffing, resources, and governance. Reporting shall be in a format convenient for stakeholders and can include printed and digital reports, audio programming or real-time online systems. All reports shall be published on a timely basis and in particular financial data, including filed tax returns, shall be publicly available within 30 days of necessary audits. Organizations shall use best efforts to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of information released and shall promptly correct inaccuracies or incorrect materials.

===Practical Limitations===
Within the scope of Open Philanthropy there are practical limitations to the extent all materials shall be open and visible by the public.  Materials whose release would be prohibited by law, or that may compromise the corporate or personal safety of others are exempt. Those items with contractual privacy or licensing arrangements do not require disclosure. Organizations shall not disclose information that compromises the integrity of others, and/or organizational processes and policies. Only to the extent as explicitly permitted, donor information shall be exempt.  In compliance with trademark law, trade names and marks are exempt from reuse without attribution.

[[File:Slavic europe.svg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|Contemporary map of the [[Slavic people|Slavic speaking countries]] of Europe. [[South Slavs]] appear in dark blue (with [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] in dashed lines), [[East Slavs]] in dark green, and [[West Slavs]] in light green.]]
'''Pan-Slavism''', a movement which crystallized in the mid-19th century, is the [[political ideology]] concerned with the advancement of integrity and unity for the [[Slavic people|Slavic-speaking people]]s. Its main impact occurred in the [[Balkans]], where non-Slavic empires had ruled the [[South Slav]]s for centuries. These were mainly the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (both as separate entities for most of the period), the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].

== Origins ==
Extensive pan-Slavism began much like [[Pan-Germanism]], both of which grew from the sense of unity and [[nationalism]] experienced within [[ethnic group]]s after the [[French Revolution]] and the consequent [[Napoleonic Wars]] against European monarchies. Like other [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of [[history]], [[philology]], and [[folklore]] actively encouraged the passion of their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism also co-existed with the [[South Slavs|Southern Slavic]] independence.

Commonly used symbols of the Pan-Slavic movement were the [[Pan-Slavic colours]] (blue, white and red) and the Pan-Slavic anthem, ''[[Hey, Slavs]]''.

The first pan-Slavists were the 16th-century Croatian writer [[Vinko Pribojević]] and the 17th-century [[Aleksandar Komulović]], [[Bartol Kašić]], [[Ivan Gundulić]] and [[Croats|Croatian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] missionary [[Juraj Križanić]].&lt;ref&gt;John M. Letiche and Basil Dmytryshyn: "Russian Statecraft: The Politika of Iurii Krizhanich", Oxford and New York, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivo Banac]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC&amp;pg=PA71 "The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics"], Cornell University Press, 1988, pp. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eighteenth Century: A Current Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBtVAAAAYAAJ|year=1992|publisher=American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies|page=162|quote=... the work of some early "Panslavic" ideologues in the sixteenth (Pribojevic) and seventeenth (Gundulic, Komulovic, Kasic,...)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest manifestations of Pan-Slavic thought within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] have been attributed to [[Adam František Kollár|Adam Franz Kollár]] and [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Weston Evans, Chapter "Nationality in East-Central Europe: Perception and Definition before 1848." ''Austria, Hungary, and the Habsburgs: Essays on Central Europe, c.1683-1867.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement began following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. In the aftermath, the leaders of Europe sought to restore the pre-war [[status quo]]. At the [[Congress of Vienna]], Austria's representative, [[Metternich|Prince von Metternich]], felt the threat to this status quo in Austria was the nationalists demanding independence from the empire. While their subjects were composed of numerous ethnic groups (such as [[Italians]], [[Romanians]], [[Hungarians]], etc.), most of the subjects were Slavs.

== First Pan-Slav Congress, Prague, 1848 ==
The [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|First Pan-Slav congress]] was held in [[Prague]], [[Bohemia]] in June, 1848, during the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movement of 1848]]. The Czechs had refused to send representatives to the [[Frankfurt Assembly]] feeling that Slavs had a distinct interest from the Germans. The [[Austroslavism|Austroslav]], [[František Palacký]], presided over the event. Most of the delegates were Czech and Slovak. Palacký called for the co-operation of the [[Habsburg]]s and had also endorsed the Habsburg monarchy as the political formation most likely to protect the peoples of [[central Europe]]. When the Germans asked him to declare himself in favour of their desire for national unity, he replied that he would not as this would weaken the Habsburg state: “Truly, if it were not that [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] had long existed, it would be necessary, in the interest of [[Europe]], in the interest of [[All humanity|humanity]] itself, to create it.”

The Pan-Slav congress met during the revolutionary turmoil of 1848. Young inhabitants of Prague had taken to the streets and in the confrontation, a stray bullet had killed the wife of [[Field Marshal]] [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]], the commander of the Austrian forces in Prague. Enraged, Windischgrätz seized the city, disbanded the congress, and established [[martial law]] throughout Bohemia.

== Pan-Slavism in Czech lands and Slovakia ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
{{main article|Czechoslovakism}}
[[File:Flag of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|right|Slavic flag proposed by the Pan-Slav convention&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Вилинбахов Г. В.'' [http://www.dissercat.com/content/gosudarstvennaya-geraldika-v-rossii-teoriya-i-praktika Государственная геральдика в России: Теория и практика] {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Prague]] in 1848]]

The first Pan-Slavic convention was held in Prague on June 2 through 16, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;See Note 134 on page 725 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14'' (International Publishers: New York, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  The delegates at the Congress were specifically both [[Austria-hungary#Ethnic relations|anti-Austrian]] and [[Russification#Poland and Lithuania|anti-Russian]]. Still "the Right"—the moderately liberal wing of the Congress—under the leadership of [[František Palacký]] (1798–1876), a Czech historian and politician,&lt;ref&gt;See the biographical note on page 784 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pavol Jozef Šafárik]] (1795–1861), a Slovak philologist, historian and archaeologist,&lt;ref&gt;See the biographical note at page 787 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''&lt;/ref&gt; favored autonomy of the Slav lands within the framework of Austrian (Habsburg) monarchy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;See Note 134 on page 725 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast "the Left"—the radical wing of the Congress—under the leadership of [[Karel Sabina]] (1813–1877), a Czech writer and journalist, [[Josef Václav Frič]], a Czech nationalist, [[Karol Libelt]] (1817–1861), a Polish writer and politician, and others, pressed for a close alliance with the revolutionary-democratic movement going on in Germany and Hungary in 1848.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A national rebirth in the Hungarian "Upper Land" (now [[Slovakia]]) awoken in a completely new light, both before the Slovak Uprising in 1848 and after. The driving force of this rebirth movement were Slovak writers and politicians who called themselves Štúrovci, the followers of [[Ľudovít Štúr]]. As the Slovak nobility was [[Magyarization|Magyarized]] and most of Slovaks were merely farmers or priests, this movement failed to attract much attention. Nonetheless, the campaign was successful as a brotherly cooperation between the Croats and the Slovaks brought its fruit throughout the war. Most of the battles between Slovaks and Hungarians however, did not turn out in favor for the Slovaks who were logistically supported by the Austrians, but not sufficiently. The shortage of manpower proved to be decisive as well.

During the war, the [[Slovak National Council]] brought its demands to the young Austrian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]], who seemed to take a note of it and promised support for the Slovaks against the revolutionary radical Hungarians. However the moment the revolution was over, Slovak demands were forgotten. These demands included an autonomous land within the Austrian Empire called "Slovenský kraj" which would be eventually led by a Serbian prince. This act of ignorance from the Emperor convinced the Slovak and the Czech elite who proclaimed the concept of Austroslavism as dead. 

Disgusted by the Emperor's policy, in the year of 1849, Ľudovít Štúr, the person who codified the first official [[Slovak language]], wrote a book he would name ''Slavdom and the World of the Future''. This book served him as a manifesto where he noted that Austroslavism was not the way to go anymore. He also wrote a sentence that often serves as a quote until this day: "Every nation has its time under God's sun, and the [[tilia|linden]] [a symbol of the Slavs] is blossoming, while the [[Oak#National_symbol|oak]] [a symbol of the Teutons] bloomed long ago."&lt;ref&gt;({{lang-sk|Každý národ má svoj čas pod Božím slnkom, a lipa kvitne až dub už dávno odkvitol.}}) {{Cite book|title=Slovanstvo a svet budúcnosti. Bratislava 1993, s. 59|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He expressed confidence in the [[Russian Empire]] however, as it was the only country of Slavs that was not dominated by anybody else, yet it was one of the most powerful nations in the world. He often symbolized Slavs as being a tree, with "minor" Slavic nations being branches while the trunk of the tree was Russian. His Pan-Slavic views were unleashed in this book, where he stated that the land of Slovaks should be annexed by the Tsar's empire and that eventually the population could be not only [[Russification|Russified]], but also converted into the rite of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]], religion originally spread by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril and Methodius]] during the times of [[Great Moravia]], which served as an opposition to the [[Catholic church|Catholic]] missionaries from the [[Franks]]. After the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian invasion of Pannonia]], Hungarians converted into Catholicism, which effectively influenced the Slavs living in [[Pannonia]] and in the land south of the Lechs.

However, the Russian Empire often claimed Pan-Slavism as a justification for its aggressive moves in the Balkan Peninsula of Europe against the Ottoman Empire, which conquered and held the land of Slavs for centuries. This eventually led to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Balkan campaign]] of the Russian Empire, which resulted in the entire Balkan being liberated from the Ottoman Empire, with the help and the initiative of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, "Germany and Pan-Slavism" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 14'', pp. 156-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-Slavism has some supporters among Czech and Slovak politicians, especially among the nationalistic and far-right ones, such as People's Party - Our Slovakia.

During [[World War I]], captured Slavic soldiers were asked to fight against "oppression in the Austrian Empire". Consequently, some did. (see [[Czechoslovak Legions]])

The creation of an independent [[Czechoslovakia]] made the old ideals of Pan-Slavism anachronistic. Relations with other Slavic states varied, sometimes being so tense it escalated into an armed conflict, such as with the [[Second Polish Republic]] where border clashes over [[Silesia]] resulted in a short hostile conflict, the [[Polish–Czechoslovak War]]. Even tensions between Czechs and Slovaks had appeared before and during the World War II.

The capital city of Slovakia is [[Bratislava]], a name that is a conjunction of the word Brother (Brat) and Glory (Slava), a name which is generally considered as a symbol of Slavic identity, brotherhood and values.

== Pan-Slavism among South Slavs ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
{{main article|Yugoslavism}}
Pan-Slavism in the south would often turn to Russia for support. The Southern Slavic movement advocated the independence of the Slavic peoples in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Some Serbian intellectuals sought to unite all of the Southern, Balkan Slavs, whether [[Catholicism|Catholic]] ([[Croats]], [[Slovenes]]), [[Islam|Muslim]] ([[Bosniaks]]), or [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] ([[Serbs]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Bulgarians]]) as a "Southern-Slavic nation of three faiths".

Austria feared that Pan-Slavists would endanger the empire. In Austria-Hungary Southern Slavs were distributed among several entities: [[Slovenes]] in the Austrian part ([[Carniola]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]] (also [[Croats]])), Croats and [[Serbs]] in the Hungarian part within the autonomous [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and in the Austrian part within the autonomous [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], and in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], under direct control from Vienna. Due to a different position within Austria-Hungary several different goals were prominent among the Southern Slavs of Austria-Hungary. A strong alternative to Pan-Slavism was [[Austroslavism]],&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Citation

Because the Serbs were dispersed among several regions, and the fact that they had ties to the independent [[Nation-state|nation state]] of [[Kingdom of Serbia]], they were among the strongest supporters of independence of South-Slavs from Austria-Hungary and uniting into a common state under Serbian monarchy.

In 1863, the [[Association of Serbian Philology]] commemorated the death of [[Cyril]] a thousand years earlier, its president [[Dimitrije Matić]], talked of the creation of an ethnically "pure" Slavonic people: "with God’s help, there should be a whole Slavonic people with purely Slavonic faces and of purely Slavonic character"&lt;ref&gt;Association of Serbian Philology: Hiljadugodišnja 1863:4&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], under Serbian royalty of the [[Karađorđević dynasty]], united most Southern [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking nations]] regardless of religion and cultural background. The only ones they did not unite with were the Bulgarians. Still, in the years after the [[Second World War]], there were proposals to incorporate Bulgaria into a [[Greater Yugoslavia]] thus uniting all south [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking nations]] into one state.&lt;ref&gt;Ramet, Sabrina P.; ''The three Yugoslavias: state-building and legitimation, 1918-2005''; [[Indiana University Press]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-253-34656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was abandoned after the split between [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1948. This led to some bitter sentiment between the people of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the aftermath.

At the end of Second World War, the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] leader [[Josip Broz Tito]], a Croat, became Yugoslav president, and the country become a socialist republic. Tito advocated [[Brotherhood and unity]] which meant equality among the ethnic groups, including non-Slav minorities. This led to relatively peaceful co-existence and prosperity until the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation]].

== Pan-Slavism in Poland ==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=July 2017}}
Although early Pan-Slavism had found support among some Poles, it soon lost its appeal as the movement became dominated by [[Russia]]. While Russian Pan-Slavists spoke of liberation of other Slavs through Russian actions, parts of [[Poland]] had been ruled by the [[Russian Empire]] since the [[Partitions of Poland]]. At different points in history, Poland often saw itself in partnership with non-Slavic nations, such as [[Hungary-Poland relations|Hungary]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Polish–Swedish union|Sweden]] and [[Lithuania]] under the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Especially after 1795, [[First French Republic|Revolutionary]] and [[First French Empire|Napoleonic]] France was held in high regard by most Poles, and seen as the main champion of [[Duchy of Warsaw|reconstitution of their country]], particularly since it was a mutual enemy of Austria, Prussia and Russia. The influence of 19th century Pan-Slavism had little impact in Poland except for creating sympathy towards the other oppressed Slavic nations and their aspirations to independence. At the same time while Pan-Slavism worked against Austro-Hungary with South Slavs, Poles enjoyed a wide autonomy within the state and assumed a loyalist position towards the Hapsburgs. Within the Austro-Hungarian polity, they were able to develop their national culture and preserve [[Polish language]], both of which were under threat in both [[Germany|German]] and [[Russia]]n Empires. A Pan-Slavic federation was proposed, but on the condition that the [[Russian Empire]] would be excluded from such an entity. After Poland regained its independence (from Germany, Austria and Russia) in 1918 no major force considered Pan-Slavism as a serious alternative, viewing Pan-Slavism as little more than a code word for [[Russification]]. During Poland's communist era, the [[USSR]] used Pan-Slavism as propaganda tool to justify its control over the country. The issue of the Pan-Slavism was not part of current mainstream politics, and is widely seen as an ideology of Russian [[imperialism]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Joseph Conrad]] in Notes on Life and Letters.:
&lt;br/&gt;''"... between Polonism and Slavonism there is not so much hatred as a complete and ineradicable incompatibility."'' ... Conrad argues that "nothing is more foreign than what in the literary world is called Slavonism to his ''individual'' sensibility and ''the whole Polish mentality"''&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on Life and Letters''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Pan-Slavism in Russia ==

Pan-Slavism is popular in the large [[immigration]] from the former [[USSR]] to Slavic countries of the [[European Union]]. It expresses fierce populism, nostalgia for the Soviet era, and strong anti-Western [[Feeling|sentiments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/articles/2015/05/22/slavesobor/ Report about the XII. Pan-slavic congress in Moscow, May 2015 (in Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13277505/RusV_16-17_15_p.pdf |title=Slavic Unity. Special issue of the news "Russky vestnik" Nr 16-17 (930-931), texts from the XII. Pan-slavic congress in Moscow, May 2015 (in Russian) |access-date=2015-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126043955/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13277505/RusV_16-17_15_p.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the Soviet Union, Bolshevik teachings viewed Pan-Slavism as a reactionary element formerly used by the [[Russian Empire]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} As a result, Bolsheviks viewed it as contrary to their Marxist ideology. However, with the emergence of [[World War II]], the Stalinist government saw fit to utilize Pan-Slavic politics, resulting in the Pan-Slavic congress being held in Moscow in 1942.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Modern-day developments ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
The authentic idea of unity of the Slavic people was all but gone after [[World War I]] when the maxim "[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] have put an end to all Slavisms"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN3110106051&amp;id=AsO_M5SaxDgC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22west+slavs%22&amp;sig=EmpK-yEW2OHxlLLqb7pZ1GvOOws Comparative Slavic Studies] Volume 6, by [[Roman Jakobson]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was finally put to rest with the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in late 1980s. With the breakup of federal states such as [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] and the problem of Russian and Serbian dominance in any proposed all-Slavic organisation, the idea of Pan-Slavic unity is mostly considered dead in the western world. Varying relations between the Slavic countries exist nowadays; they range from mutual respect on equal footing and sympathy towards one another through traditional dislike and enmity, to indifference. None, other than culture and heritage oriented organizations, are currently considered as a form of rapprochement among the countries with Slavic origins. The political parties which include panslavism as part of their program usually live on the fringe of the political spectrum (e.g. in Poland candidates from Związek Słowiański got no more than few thousands votes). In modern times, the appeals to Pan-Slavism are often made in [[Belarus]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="Duleba"&gt;"In other words, the Pan-Slavic resentment is not strange to the Russian Eurasianists, however, this is prevailingly limited to the post-Soviet space. Therein lies the difference between the Eurasians and the Russian radical nationalists in their contemporary attitude to Pan-Slavism. Radical nationalists are the only ones who follow up with the tradition and ideational message of the Central- and South-European Pan-Slavism of the tsarist Russia. Pan-Slavism serves as their tool for demonstrating decisive anti-Western attitudes and as an "historical" folklore employed in domestic-political battles, which sound so sweet to the Russian ear. The ideas of Pan-Slavism only find some echo with the part of some Serbian and partly Slovak nationalists" Alexander Duleba, "From Domination to Partnership - The perspectives of Russian-Central-East European Relations", Final Report to the [[NATO]] Research Fellowship Program, 1996-1998 [http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/96-98/duleba.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation of Pan-Slavic languages ==
The similarity of Slavic languages inspired many people to create [[Pan-Slavic language]]s, i.e., [[zonal constructed language]]s for all Slavic people to communicate with one another. Several of these languages were created in the past, but due to the Internet, many more Pan-Slavic languages were created in the [[Digital Age]]. The most popular modern Pan-Slavic language is [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Historical example===
{{Main article|Trial of Socrates}}
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).]]

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. 

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C. ''The Trials of Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main article|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J.

'''Political culture''' is defined by the ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]]'' as the "set of attitudes, beliefs and sentiments that give order and meaning to a [[Politics|political]] process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the [[political system]]". It encompasses both the political ideals and operating norms of a [[polity]]. Political culture is thus the manifestation of the psychological and subjective dimensions of politics. A political ''culture'' is the product of both the history of a political system and the histories of the members. Thus, it is rooted equally in public events and private experience.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', New York: Macmillen, 1968, Vol. 12, p. 218 (quoted in Jo Freedman, [http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polparties/polculture.htm The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties] (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions==
In 1963, two Americans, Gabriel Almond&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/january8/obitalmond-18.html Stanford Report, Obit: Gabriel Almond, January 8, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sidney Verba, outlined three types of political culture that can be combined to create civic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verba|first1=Sidney|last2=Almond|first2=Gabriel|title=The Civic Culture|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three key features expressed by both men were composed to establish a link between the public and the government. The first of these features is "deference", which considers the concepts of respect, acknowledgment of "inferiority" or "superiority", and authority in society.

The second key feature is "consensus" which represents the key link between government and public agreement and appeasement. Support for appeasement may not always be shared by the whole nation, but as a whole, people agree to sustain it, meaning it is a common agreement. There are various "Examples of Consensus" in British political culture: how people are governed as a whole, consensus regarding the welfare state, agreement as to who acts as head of state, and with what powers.

The third feature of British political culture is "homogeneity". Church attendance as a whole is decreasing. Sections of the Scottish and Welsh populations have called for independence.

==Political philosophy==
The term political culture was brought into political science to promote the American political system. The concept was used by [[Gabriel Almond]] in the late 50s, and outlined in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' (1963, [[Gabriel Almond|Almond]] &amp; [[Sidney Verba|Verba]]), but was soon opposed by two European political scientists, [[Gerhard Lehmbruch]] and [[Arend Lijphart]]. Lehmbruch analysed politics in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] and Lijphart analysed politics in [[Netherlands]]. Both argued that there are political systems that are more stable than the one in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Lukšič, Igor (2006). ''Politična kultura'', pp. 40–42. [[University of Ljubljana|FDV, Ljubljana]]. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Different typologies of political culture have been proposed. According to political scientist William S. Stewart, all political behavior can be explained as participating in one or more of eight political cultures: [[anarchism]], [[oligarchy]], [[Tory corporatism]], [[fascism]], [[classical liberalism]], radical liberalism, [[democratic socialism]], and [[Leninist socialism]]. Societies that exemplify each of these cultures have existed historically.

[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]] in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' outlined three pure types of political culture based on  level and type of [[political participation]] and the nature of people's attitudes toward politics:
* [[Parochial political culture|Parochial]] – Where citizens are only remotely aware of the presence of central government, and live their lives near enough regardless of the decisions taken by the state, distant and unaware of political phenomena. They have neither knowledge nor interest in politics. This type of political culture is in general congruent with a traditional political structure.
* Subject – Where citizens are aware of central government, and are heavily subjected to its decisions with little scope for dissent. The individual is aware of politics, its actors and institutions. It is affectively oriented towards politics, yet it is on the "downward flow" side of the politics. In general congruent with a centralized authoritarian structure.
* Participant – Citizens are able to influence the government in various ways and they are affected by it. The individual is oriented toward the system as a whole, to both the political and administrative structures and processes (to both the input and output aspects). In general congruent with a democratic political structure.

Almond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can combine to create the [[civic culture]], which mixes the best elements of each.

[[Arend Lijphart]] wrote that there are different classifications of political culture:
* First classification:
** Mass political culture
** [[Elite]] political culture
* Second classification (of elite political culture):
** coalitional
** contradictive

Lijphart also classified the structure of society:
* homogeneous
* heterogeneous

'''Political journalism''' is a broad branch of [[journalism]] that includes coverage of all aspects of [[politics]] and [[political science]], although the term usually refers specifically to coverage of civil [[government]]s and [[political power]].

Political journalism aims to provide voters with the information to formulate their own opinion and participate in community, local or national matters that will affect them. According to Edward Morrissey in an opinion article from theweek.com, political journalism frequently includes opinion journalism, as current political events can be biased in their reporting. The information provided includes facts, its perspective is subjective and leans towards one viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrissey|first1=Edward|title=The election is not rigged against Trump. But the media is biased against the GOP.|url=http://theweek.com/articles/655596/election-not-rigged-against-trump-but-media-biased-against-gop|website=the week.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brendan Nyhan and John Sides argue that "Political journalists who report on politics are frequently unfamiliar with political science research or question its relevance to their work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists covering politics who are unfamiliar with information that would provide context to their stories can enable the story to take a different spin on what is being reported.

Political journalism is provided through different mediums, in print, broadcast, or online reporting. Digital media use has increased and it provides instant coverage of campaign, politics, event news and an accessible platform for the candidate. Media outlets known for their political journalism like ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', have increased their use of this medium as well. Printed, online, and broadcast political humor presented as entertainment has been used to provide updates on aspects of government status, political news, campaign, and election updates. According to Geoffrey Baym, the information provided may not be considered "fake news" but the lines between entertainment and factual news may seem blurred or biased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Journalism Journal|date=2005|pages=259–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; while providing political updates. This type of journalism is analyzed, interpreted, and discussed by news media pundits and editorialists. It can lack objectivity which can prevent the accuracy of the presented information. The reporting of news with a bias view point can also take away the audience's ability to form their own opinion or beliefs of what has been reported. This type of reporting is subjective with a possible social or political purpose.

==Subsets==
* '''Election journalism''' or '''electoral journalism''' is a subgenre of political journalism which focuses upon and analyzes developments related to an approximate election and political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|title=Towards an electoral journalism|first=Jorge|last=Bravo|journal=Mundo Electoral - Electoral World|publisher=mundoelectoral.com|volume=3|issue=8|date=May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402102625/http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|archivedate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of journalism provides information to the electorate that can educate and help form opinion that empowers a specific vote. This subgenre, like data journalism, makes use of numerical data, such as statistics, polls and historic data in regards to a candidate's chance of success for office, or a party's change in size in a legislature. It provides knowledge that may make the presented news hold more relevance. Information added to the reports are of campaign statuses and political events. A politician's strategy can be exaggerated or provided without context or historical perspective. Trends on each party candidate are reported and at times compared to previous party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help Journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news on the status of the elections, like other political reporting's, are provided in different mediums. The election report coverage has taken full advantage of the digital era in providing instant access to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piechota|first1=Grazyna|title=Media in Election Process|journal=Communication Today|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Defense journalism''' or '''military journalism''' is a subgenre which focuses upon the current status of a nation's military, intelligence and other defense-related faculties. Interest in defense journalism tends to increase during times of violent conflict, with military leaders being the primary actors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} During the course of military journalism, news reporters are sometimes assigned to military units to report news taking place in areas of conflict. The term embedded journalism was used when the media was involved in the reporting of the war in Iraq. Embedded journalism can also be biased because it is one sided. Information reported has been collected from the area the journalist has been stationed with the possibility to lean towards the agenda of the group they have been assigned to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahey|first1=Shahira|last2=Johnson|first2=Thomas J.|title="HOW WE PERFORMED": EMBEDDED JOURNALISTS ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS COVERING THE IRAQ WAR"|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2005|pages=301–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subgenre of political journalism is also applied to media coming from journalists embedded in a particular campaign or candidate. Like military assignments, reports can be influenced by the message the campaign or candidate is trying to bring across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|title=The dangers of embedded journalism, in war and politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001100_2.html?sid=ST2010043001134|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a good [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaker The Tradition and practice of public speaking|last=Valenzano III|first=Joseph M.|last2=Braden|first2=Stephen W.|publisher=Fountainhead press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59871-522-4|location=United States of America|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in [[Lasswell's model of communication]]: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a [[discourse community]], in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied ''years'' after their delivery. Among these examples are [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. [[Lectern]]s hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a [[public address system]] or a [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]] when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use [[audience response systems]], allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.

Telecommunication and [[videoconferencing]] are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15024">'''Public value''' describes the value that an organization contributes to society. The term was originally coined by [[Harvard]] professor [[Mark H. Moore]] who saw it as the equivalent of [[shareholder value]] in [[public management]]. Public value is supposed to provide managers with a notion of how entrepreneurial activity can contribute to the common good. Nowadays, public value is no longer limited to the [[public sector]], but is used by all types of organization, including [[non-governmental organization]]s and [[private sector]] firms. Therefore, the public value researcher [[Timo Meynhardt]] from the [[University of St. Gallen]] and [[HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management]] uses the term to generally raise the question about organizations' contribution to the [[common good]]. He believes that current management concepts, such as [[shareholder value]], [[Shareholder value#Stakeholder value|stakeholder value]], [[customer value proposition|customer value]], [[sustainability]] or [[corporate social responsibility]], should legitimize themselves in regard to their impact on the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Meynhardt, T. (2009). Public Value: Organisationen machen Gesellschaft. In: ''OrganisationsEntwicklung''. Zeitschrift für Unternehmensentwicklung und Change Management 2013, Nr. 4, S. 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his (social-)psychological-based concept, public value emerges for individuals from the experiences made in social structures and relationships. Hence, it can be seen as a prerequisite and a resource for successful living.&lt;ref name="Meynhardt, 2009"&gt;Meynhardt, T. (2009). Public Value Inside: What is Public Value Creation? ''International Journal of Public Administration'', 32 (3-4), 192-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

''Public values are those providing normative consensus about (1) the rights, benefits, and prerogatives to which citizens should (and should not) be entitled; (2) the obligations of citizens to society, the state and one another; and (3) the principles on which governments and policies should be based.'' Bozeman, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Bozeman, B. (2007). ''Public Values and Public Interest: Counterbalancing Economic Individualism.'' Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Public value is value for the public. Value for the public is a result of evaluations about how basic needs of individuals, groups and the society as a whole are influenced in relationships involving the public. Public value then is also value from the public, i.e., “drawn” from the experience of the public. The public is an indispensable operational fiction of society. Any impact on shared experience about the quality of the relationship between the individual and society can be described as public value creation. Public value creation is situated in relationships between the individual and society, founded in individuals, constituted by subjective evaluations against basic needs, activated by and realized in emotional-motivational states, and produced and reproduced in experience-intense practices.'' Meynhardt, 2009&lt;ref name="Meynhardt, 2009" /&gt;

''The definition that remains equates managerial success in the public sector with initiating and reshaping public sector enterprises in ways that increase their value to the public in both the short and the long run.'' Moore, 1995&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. (1995). Creating Public Value – Strategic Management in Government. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Public Value (or Public Value Capital) then is the combined view of the public about what they regard as valuable.'' Talbot, 2006&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, C. (2006). ''Paradoxes and prospects of 'Public Value''. Paper presented at Tenth International research Symposium on Public Management, Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the public sector==
The research program on public value was kicked off by Professor Mark H. Moore of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who published a book on the subject, ''Creating Public Value. Strategic Management in Government'', in 1995. In this sense, public value can be instituted as an organising principle in a [[public sector]] organisation, providing a focus in the context of which individual employees are free to pursue and propose new ideas about how to improve the working of the organisation, in terms of [[efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] or services. Public organisations seeking to use public value as a principle need to create a corporate culture in which the pursuit of public values by employees is rewarded just as pursuing shareholder value is rewarded in private [[corporation]]s. 

The concept has been taken up initially by academics, [[think tank]]s and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, and later by a number of public sector organisations in the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries.

In 2004 it was used by the [[BBC]] as the cornerstone of its manifesto for the renewal of its charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/policies/pdf/bpv.pdf|title=Building public value: Renewing the BBC for a digital world|last=|first=|publisher=BBC|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203212457/https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/policies/pdf/bpv.pdf|archive-date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/160610|title=The revolution that started in a library|last=Crabtree|first=James|date=27 September 2004|website=New Statesman|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Accenture]] launched the Institute for Public Service Value (IPSV), to explore how public value is created in government organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-launches-institute-for-public-service-value-to-identify-and-promote-leading-practices-in-government-service-delivery.htm|title=Accenture Launches Institute for Public Service Value to Identify and Promote Leading Practices in Government Service Delivery {{!}} Accenture Newsroom|website=newsroom.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Parston, co-founder and former Chief Executive of the Office for Public Management, and a collaborator with Professor Moore, was appointed Director. Among many other studies, IPSV conducted the Global Cities Forum in 2007-2009, which facilitated  citizens' deliberations on their experiences and expectations of public value in 17 cities around the world. 

In 2006, the Center for Technology in Government (CTG) in partnership with [[SAP AG]], conducted research on the topic of public value in the context of governments' investments in [[information technology]] (IT). The results of this research found that governments' ability to realize the full value of IT investments is not completely measurable in terms of financial results. More specifically, the five U.S. and international governments studied, looked for the full value of government IT investments in both the internal value to government operations and the broader political and social returns to the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/issuebriefs/opengov_pubvalue.pdf|title=Delivering public value through open government|last=|first=|publisher=Center for Technology in Government, The Research Foundation of State University of New York|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117222318/https://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/issuebriefs/opengov_pubvalue.pdf|archive-date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point of view, there are two sources of public value: 
# value that results from improving the government itself as an asset to society and 
# value that results from the delivery of specific benefits directly to persons or groups.

The German Federal Employment Agency uses the public value concept to better understand its contribution to society that goes beyond simple task fulfillment and make it a yardstick for management decisions. An empirical study has shown that a particular value of this organization is seen in its contribution to social peace in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Meynhardt, T. und Bartholomes, S. (2011). (De)Composing Public Value: In Search of Basic Dimensions and Common Ground. ''International Public Management Journal'', 14 (3), 284–308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the private sector==
Public value is also taken up by private sector companies that want to maintain a license to operate and understand what implications new strategies and projects might have in terms of public value creation/ destruction. Such analyses can be done using a Public Value Scorecard as proposed by [[Timo Meynhardt]] and Peter Gomez.&lt;ref&gt;Meynhardt, T. and Gomez, P. (2013). Organisationen schöpfen Wert für die Gesellschaft. In: Heuser, J. et al. ''DIE ZEIT erklärt die Wirtschaft'' (199–207). Hamburg: Murmann.&lt;/ref&gt; Public value acknowledges that established business paradigms such as [[Customer value maximization|customer value]] or [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholder value]] risk overemphasizing certain aspects of business' value contribution to society at the expense of other important dimensions. It pledges for a redefinition of the entire notion of value creation as it takes utilitarian and hedonistic as well as political and moral aspects of value creation into account.&lt;ref&gt;Meynhardt, T., Gomez, P. and Schweizer, M. (2014). The Public Value Scorecard: what makes an organization valuable to society? ''Performance'', 6 (1), 2–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of firms use public value to obtain management information helping to take strategic decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2667302083&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=em0LQR7RWJs&amp;v=tLGAQ4q_Sb0 Public Value: ''Common Good and the Society''. Movie by the University of St. Gallen.]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

*[[Fresenius Medical Care]], a German producer of medical supplies and operator of dialysis clinics, complements its [[balanced scorecard]] with the Public Value Scorecard. Through the inclusion of an external perspective the firm wants to gain a better understanding of the public value of healthcare service that are supplied by private firms. In a first project, the firm has systematically measured the public value of its dialysis centers in Great Britain. The management wants to use the insights gained in this study for positioning towards the firms' stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Armsen, W.; Lampe, R.; Moeller, S. and Gatti, E. (2013); Gesundheitsdienstleistungen in der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung: Die Messung des gesellschaftlichen Nutzens privatisierter Gesundheitsdienstleistungen.

*The football club [[FC Bayern Munich]] uses to public value approach to systematically assess the challenges pertaining to its societal role that come along with its growth from a regionally embedded football club to a global entertainment brand. For a football club that enjoys permanent public attention and is seen as a role model by many people, such questions are especially relevant. Different public values such as "Mia san mia" (Bavarian for "us is us") and "global brand image" are partly in tension with each other. The structured compilation of the club's societal value can be used as management information for strategic decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Beringer, L. and Bernard, S.

The '''Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear''' was a gathering that took place on October 30, 2010, at the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The rally was led by [[Jon Stewart]], host of the satirical news program ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Stephen Colbert (character)|in-character]] as a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Pundit (expert)|political pundit]].&lt;ref name=torontosun&gt;{{cite news|title=200K turn out to 'Restore Sanity' in Washington|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=October 30, 2010|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/10/30/15890551.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 215,000 people attended the rally, according to [[aerial photography]] analysis by AirPhotosLive.com for ''[[CBS News]]''.&lt;ref name=cbs-size&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021284-503544.html|work=CBS News|title=Jon Stewart Rally Attracts Estimated 215,000|first=Brian|last=Montopoli|date=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rally was a combination of what initially were announced as separate events: Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity" and Colbert's counterpart, the "March to Keep Fear Alive." Its stated purpose was to provide a venue for attendees to be heard above what Stewart described as the more vocal and extreme 15–20% of Americans who "control the conversation" of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]],&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gkOsOs61eFqq5znyHyVThYNAGTDw|title=US comics unveil dueling DC political rallies|date=September 17, 2010|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the argument being that these extremes demonize each other and engage in counterproductive actions, with a return to sanity intended to promote reasoned discussion.  Despite Stewart's insistence to the contrary, news reports cast the rally as a spoof of [[Glenn Beck]]'s [[Restoring Honor rally]] and [[Al Sharpton]]'s [[Reclaim the Dream commemorative march|Reclaim the Dream]] rally.&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/51942/212962|title=Jon Stewart: Rallies Not a Response to Glenn Beck|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Response to Restoring Honor rally===
On August 28, 2010, the [[Fox News]] Channel's Glenn Beck held a "Restoring Honor" rally at the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. On the same day, [[Al Sharpton]] led a countermarch, called [[Reclaim the Dream commemorative march|Reclaim the Dream]], to mark the 47th anniversary of the historic [[Great March on Washington]].&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt; According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', discussion for a satirical public event in response took place behind the scenes at Stewart's ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as early as August 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title="August 12, 2010"|url=|series=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|serieslink=|credits=Executive Producers: [[Rory Albanese]], Josh Lieb, [[Jon Stewart]]|network=[[Comedy Central]]|station=|city=|airdate=August 12, 2010|began=|ended=|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=|transcript=|transcripturl=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/68086/index1.html|title=America Is a Joke|author=Chris Smith|date=September 12, 2011|work=[[New York Magazine]]|publisher=New York Media LLC.|pages=2, 5|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart has stated that the rally was never intended to be a means to counter Glenn Beck, but was simply another format for his and Colbert's style of humor, saying "We saw [the Restoring Honor rally] and thought, 'What a beautiful outline. What a beautiful structure to fill with what we want to express in live form, festival form.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130321994|title=Jon Stewart: The Most Trusted Name In Fake News|author=|date=October 4, 2010|work=[[National Public Radio]]|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before any public discussion by Stewart, Colbert, or their staffs, members of the [[social news]] website [[Reddit]] independently began to discuss the possibility of a Colbert-led rally, often referred to as a "Restoring [[Truthiness]] Rally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=150942998258775|title=100,000 Strong to Restore Truthiness to the US Capital|publisher=Facebook|date=|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the rallies were announced, some news articles credited Reddit for the idea.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost1&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=Melissa|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2010/09/rally_to_restore_sanity_to_mee.html|title=Blog Post – 'Rally to Restore Sanity' to meet 'March to Keep Fear Alive;' Reddit users talk about starting the online campaign|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was produced by Stewart's Busboy Productions.

===Announcement===
[[File:Colbert-Stewart 2010 DC rally posters.png|thumb|right|Early posters for the then-separate rallies]]
Stewart first hinted at the event on the September 7 episode of ''The Daily Show'' by declaring that "[he would] have an announcement sometime in the near to not so near future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-7-2010/moment-of-zen---jon-s-important-announcement |title=Moment of Zen – Jon's Important Announcement – The Daily Show with Jon Stewart – 09/07/10 – Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=September 7, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert, in that night's episode of ''The Report,'' said that he, too, had an announcement to make.  In the following days, Stewart and Colbert used their shows to hype their respective announcements, competing over whose would be more significant.  The banter finally culminated with Stewart formally announcing the "Rally to Restore Sanity" on the September 16, 2010 episode of ''The Daily Show'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title="September 16, 2010"|url=|series=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|serieslink=|credits=Executive Producers: [[Rory Albanese]], Josh Lieb, [[Jon Stewart]]|network=[[Comedy Central]]|station=|city=|airdate=September 16, 2010|began=|ended=|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=|transcript=|transcripturl=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert followed by announcing the "March to Keep Fear Alive" on the subsequent episode of ''The Colbert Report.''

Stewart declared that his rally was intended for the majority of Americans, "the 70–80 percenters," who do not hold extreme political views and lack a voice in the media. To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: "Take it down a notch for America." A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the ''Daily Show'' featuring messages such as "I disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own "March to Keep Fear Alive." Noting that this was not the time to be reasonable, Colbert declared, "Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,2019855,00.html|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Quotes of the Day|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oprah Winfrey]] appeared on ''The Daily Show'' via video on October 14, 2010, to award the attending audience free airfare to the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-october-14-2010/rally-to-restore-sanity-and-or-fear-announcement|title=Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear Announcement|publisher=Comedy Central|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane tickets were hidden under the audience members' seats in the same fashion as she has given away prizes to her own audience members on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021261-503544.html|date=October 30, 2010|title=Jon Stewart's "Rally to Restore Sanity:" A "Non-Political" Rally That Is Actually Politically Charged|first=Christine|last=Delargy|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode of the ''Colbert Report'' airing immediately afterward, Stephen Colbert also offered tickets to his rally. Without Oprah's support to provide airfare, Colbert instead distributed vouchers for the low-cost [[Chinatown bus]] from [[New York City]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] During the show, Colbert also revealed to Stewart that he did not possess a permit to legally organize the "March to Keep Fear Alive," leading Stewart to propose combining the two events into the "Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear" that would feature a new combined logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/15/oprah-latest-star-lend-celebrity-stewarts-rally/|title=Oprah Latest Star to Lend Celebrity Endorsement to Stewart's Rally|date=October 15, 2010|work=FoxNews.com|publisher=[[FOX News Network]], LLC|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many news organizations sought media credentials to cover the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter |first=Bill |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/business/media/15rally.html?_r=3 |title=Growing Interest, Despite Questions, in Jon Stewart's Rally |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating staff interest in attending for non-professional purposes, [[NPR]] barred staffers from attending the rally in a memo that stated: "NPR journalists may not participate in marches and rallies involving causes or issues that NPR covers, nor should they sign petitions or otherwise lend their name to such causes, or contribute money to them.

Some barred employees from attending the rally outright, while others such as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' offered more latitude, telling newsroom managers to differentiate between "participating" and "observing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2010/daily-transom/news-outlets-follow-nprs-lead-no-staffers-stewart-and-colbert-rallies#|title=News Outlets Follow NPR's Lead: No Staffers at Stewart and Colbert Rallies |publisher=The New York Observer|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity drive===
Prior to the announcement of the joint rally, supporters of the movement for a Colbert-led march had begun a [[fundraising|drive]] to raise money for educational charities through [[DonorsChoose]].org, a [[charitable organization]] of which Colbert is a member of the Board of Directors. In the first 24 hours, supporters raised over $100,000. In the days that followed, that total increased to over $250,000,&lt;ref name=washingtonpost1/&gt; and by the day of the rally over $500,000 had been contributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restoring Truthiness Giving Page|publisher=DonorsChoose.org|url=http://www.donorschoose.org/truthiness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Stewart promoted the [http://www.nationalmall.org Trust for the National Mall], urging his viewers to make donations on behalf of the rally. As of October 31, 2010, over $188,000 had been donated to the Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donations to date|publisher=Trust for the National Mall|url=https://www.nationalmall.org/donationform.php/rtrs?fund=Rally%20to%20Restore%20Sanity|access-date=October 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910215030/https://www.nationalmall.org/donationform.php/rtrs?fund=Rally%20to%20Restore%20Sanity#|archive-date=September 10, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rally==

Jon Stewart satirically estimated the crowd size at 10 million people during the event. Colbert later tweeted that it had been 6 billion.&lt;ref name=ny-daily-news&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[NY Daily News]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/10/31/2010-10-31_jon_stewarts_rally_to_restore_sanity_drew_200000_beating_estimated_attendance_at.html|title=Jon Stewart's 'Rally to Restore Sanity' drew 200,000, beating estimated attendance at Glenn Beck's|first=Meena|last=Hartenstein|date=October 31, 2010|accessdate=November 2, 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Setting===
As the number of expected participants grew, the rally was moved from the grounds of the Washington Monument to the east end of the Mall facing the Capitol. The stage was on the east side of the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.

Portable toilets and first aid stations were also provided. Because the rally was held the day before the previously scheduled [[Marine Corps Marathon]], the rally planners originally requested to share the portable toilets planned for the marathon runners. The marathon organizers refused, so a second set of portable toilets was ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/stewart-colbert-rallies-looking-for-a-few-good-porta-potties/19664942?a_dgi=aolshare_facebook|title=Stewart, Colbert Rallies Looking for a Few Good Porta-Potties|date=October 7, 2010|work=AOL News|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While both Colbert and Stewart were tight-lipped as to the event's schedule and guests, [[Metromix]]'s Washington DC website published a tentative schedule on October 27, with guest performers said to be confirmed for the event including musicians [[Sheryl Crow]], [[The Roots]] and [[Jeff Tweedy]] with [[Mavis Staples]] along with actors [[Don Novello]] (appearing as [[Father Guido Sarducci]]) and [[Sam Waterston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dc.metromix.com/events/article/rally-to-restore-sanity/2268575/content|title="Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear" Schedule|publisher=Metromix|date=October 27, 2010|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other guests included [[4troops]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/10/jon-stewart-opens-the-rally-to-restore-sanity-andor-fear-video.php|title=Jon Stewart Opens The Rally To Restore Sanity And/Or Fear (VIDEO)|publisher=TPM|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 30, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101183931/http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/10/jon-stewart-opens-the-rally-to-restore-sanity-andor-fear-video.php|archivedate=November 1, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yusuf Islam – formerly known as [[Cat Stevens]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[The O'Jays]],&lt;ref name=train&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/compost/2010/10/peace_trains_crazy_trains_love.html|title=Peace Trains, Crazy Trains, Love Trains and automobiles at Stewart rally|first=Alexandra|last=Petri|work=Washington Post|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Legend]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Tony Bennett]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/10/30/2010-10-30_thousands_of_new_yorkers_drawn_to_stephen_colbert_jon_stewart_rally_to_restore_s.html|title=Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart 'Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear' draws thousands of New Yorkers|publisher=[[Nydailynews.com]] |date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mythbusters]]'' hosts [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130952931|title='Sanity/Fear' Rally A Protest of the Absurd|publisher=[[NPR]] |date=|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; basketball player [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanglin|first=Douglas|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/8100978/Thousands-attend-Rally-to-Restore-Sanity-in-Washington.html|title=Thousands attend 'Rally to Restore Sanity' in Washington|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[R2-D2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/5-funniest-moments-of-the-rally-to-restore-sanity-and-or-fear/65448/|title=5 Funniest Moments of the 'Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear'|first=Nicole|last=Allan|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy===
Satirical comedy was woven throughout the rally with Colbert expressing, in parody, that fear was superior to Stewart's reasonableness. The theme started with Colbert—costumed like [[Evel Knievel]]—emerging from his "fear bunker" in a capsule reminiscent of the [[2010 Copiapó mining accident#Rescue|2010 Chilean miners' rescue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20101108_218_A11_TheWas66103|title=Rallying with revelry, goofiness|first=Robert|last=Evatt|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Colbert challenged Stewart point by point, usually claiming victory.

One of their battles was waged over three songs about trains. Stewart started with [[Yusuf Islam]] singing "[[Peace Train]]," which was interrupted continually by Colbert-backed [[Ozzy Osbourne]] singing "[[Crazy Train]]." The audience held up [[V sign#Vietnam War, victory and peace|peace signs]] for "Peace Train" and [[Sign of the horns|horn signs]] for "Crazy Train." Finally, Stewart and Colbert compromised singing "[[Love Train]]" with [[The O'Jays]].&lt;ref name=train/&gt;

Later, Stewart and Colbert donned matching American flag coats and sang an original song "The Greatest, Strongest Country in the World" with lyrics that reflected common liberal and conservative stereotypes, such as "I love [[NASCAR]] halftime shows with tons of TNT. ... My [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] electric scooter does 100 [[Miles per gallon|m-p-g]]. From gay men who like football ... to straight men who like ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''..."&lt;ref name=nbc-ny&gt;{{cite web|last=Hester|first=Jere|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/television/Boldly-Pushing-the-Bounds-of-Sanity-Fear--and-Comedy-106403678.html|publisher=[[NBC New York]]|title=Boldly Pushing the Bounds of Sanity, Fear&amp;nbsp;– and Comedy|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the finale, a giant [[papier-mâché]] puppet of Colbert ("Fearzilla") was brought on stage to symbolize his superiority. [[Peter Pan]]—played by [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]—then appeared and led the crowd in a chant that caused Colbert and his puppet to melt into the stage, thereby handing final victory to Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesdelphic.com/2010/11/04/rally-to-restore-sanity|title=Rally to Restore Sanity|first=Heather|last=Hall|date=November 4, 2010|work=The Times-Delphic|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medals===
Stewart gave out "Medals of Reasonableness" cast in bronze with an image of an owl and the [[Latin language|Latin]] motto ''Sit vis nobiscum,'' liberally translated by Stewart as "[[May the Force be with you]]," to:
* [[Armando Galarraga]] for his calm response to the [[Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game|blown call that cost him a perfect game]].
* [[Mick Foley]] for his contributions outside of [[professional wrestling|wrestling]], including his defense of a child mocked for being seen as gay.
* Velma Hart for her reasoned critical questions delivered to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] at a [[town hall meeting|town hall]].
* Jacob Isom for preventing an evangelist from [[2010 Qur'an-burning controversy#Other Quran desecration incidents|burning a Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news|last=Montopoli|first=Brian|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021281-503544.html|title=Jon Stewart Rallies for Sanity&amp;nbsp;— and Against Cable News|publisher=CBS News|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert awarded "Medals of Fear" cast with an image of a naked man running with scissors and the Latin motto ''Cave ne cadmium sit,'' which Colbert translated as "Warning: May contain Cadmium," to:
* Several news media outlets, collectively, for barring employees from attending the rally on their own time.&lt;ref name=cbs /&gt;
* A "tight black T-shirt" that Colbert said belonged to CNN's [[Anderson Cooper]], for always appearing during natural disasters reported on by Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-put-on-a-show_b37649|title=Jon Stewart &amp; Stephen Colbert Put on a Show|publisher=Media Bistro|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mark Zuckerberg]] for making [[Facebook]] increase fear with regard to [[Internet privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jerome|first=Sara|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/126645-zuckerberg-awarded-fear-award-at-dc-rally|title=Zuckerberg awarded 'fear' medal at D.C. rally|work=The Hill|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerberg's award was presented ''[[award in absentia|in absentia]].'' The media outlets' award was accepted on their behalf by "someone with more courage—a seven-year-old girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart 'Rally to Restore Sanity' highlights|work=The [[Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/30/AR2010103002320.html|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, videotaped messages were shown of [[Steven Slater]], known from the 2010 [[JetBlue flight attendant incident]], and [[reality TV]] star [[Teresa Giudice]], both apologizing for public acts of "unreasonableness."&lt;ref name=cbs /&gt;

==="A Moment of Sincerity" speech===
After defeating Colbert's "Fearzilla", Stewart closed the rally with a "moment... for some sincerity" to explain his intentions for the rally:&lt;ref name=crave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/132858-metal-meets-folk-meets-soul-at-the-rally-to-restore-sanity|title=Metal Meets Folk Meets Soul at The Rally To Restore Sanity: The Roots, Ozzy, Cat Stevens, Kid Rock and more joined Jon Stewart &amp; Stephen Colbert Saturday in D.C. in a show of sanity|first=Johnny|last=Firecloud|work=Crave Online|publisher=CRAVEONLINE MEDIA, LLC|date=October 31, 2010|accessdate=November 13, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529010235/http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/132858-metal-meets-folk-meets-soul-at-the-rally-to-restore-sanity|archivedate=May 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This was not a rally to ridicule people of [[faith]], or people of [[activism]], or look down our noses at the [[Heartland (United States)|heartland]], or passionate argument, or to suggest that times are not difficult and that we have nothing to fear.

He criticized the role the press plays in polarizing political debates, stating that the media—which he described as "the country's [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour politico–pundit]] perpetual panic 'conflict-inator'"—only amplifies problems and no longer makes a distinction between "hav[ing] animus" and "be[ing] enemies." He warned that demonizing opponents and accepting propaganda makes people "less safe, not more" and that "it is an insult, not only to those people, but to the racists themselves who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate."&lt;ref name=crave/&gt;

Much of the speech was devoted to the idea that "[m]ost Americans don't live their lives solely as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] or [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]]." He spoke on the subject of "reasonable compromises" that happen "every day" between persons of different beliefs, citing as an example traffic merging at the entrance to the [[Holland Tunnel]] connecting [[New York City]] and [[Jersey City]].&lt;ref name=crave/&gt;

==Response to rally==
[[Keith Olbermann]] was prominently featured in a video montage shown at the rally that focused on the anger present in cable news. Two days after the rally, he decided to suspend his "Worst Person in the World" segment on ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' in the interest of turning down the volume and anger. However, he defended the content of his show by claiming that [[MSNBC]] (the network that hosted ''Countdown'' at the time) differs from [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] in that "sticking up for the powerless is not the moral equivalent of sticking up for the powerful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/11/02/2010-11-02_keith_olbermann_drops_worst_person_in_the_world_segment_on_msnbc_after_jon_stewa.html|title=Keith Olbermann drops 'Worst Persons in the World' segment on MSNBC after Jon Stewart rally|first=Aliyah|last=Shahid|work=New York Daily News|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After tallying an online vote among his viewers, Olbermann announced that the segment would return on the November 17 broadcast as the "Not Really Worst Persons in the World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/keith-olbermanns-worst-persons-suspension-returning-according-to-his-twitter-it-is_b40332|title=Keith Olbermann's 'Worst Person' Suspension Over?

On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]],'' [[Bill Maher]] criticized the rally, saying that while Stewart and Colbert meant well, the message of the rally promoted a false equivalency between the left and the right, noting, "the big mistake of modern media has been this notion of balance for balance's sake. That the Left is just as violent and cruel as the Right...there's a difference between a mad man and a madman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=November 5, 2010|series=Real Time with Bill Maher|credits=Bill Maher|network=HBO|airdate=November 5, 2010|season=8|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, Stewart appeared on ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' and clarified the message he intended to convey at the rally: that too many have "bought into the idea that the conflict [in America] is left versus right" when the conflict is actually "corruption versus not-corruption" and that "both sides have their ways of shutting down debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2010/11/11/jon-stewart-on-the-rachel-maddow-show-we-have-a-special-place-in-our-hearts-for-fox/|title=Jon Stewart on the Rachel Maddow Show: "We Have a Special Place In Our Hearts For Fox|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rav akçesi''' was a "[[rabbi]] tax" paid by [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish communities]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turcica: revue d'études turques, Volumes 24-25|year=1992|publisher=Éditions Klincksieck|pages=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3lpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;dq=Rav+ak%C3%A7esi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ENqtTc77LZCp8APbtrSVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of Rav akçesi are unclear; it has been suggested that it was one of two taxes imposed specifically on Jews, and that it may have developed in parallel with the authority of a senior rabbi in [[Istanbul]], who was at nominally a representative and judge for Jewish communities in the Ottoman empire, although their authority may not have extended far beyond Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The privileges granted by Mehmed II to his Physician|journal=Bulletin of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]|year=1952|volume=14|pages=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rohschürmann|first=Michael|title="Die Tore der Freiheit"- Die Dhimma-Politik am Beispiel des jüdischen Milets im Osmanischen Reich und deren Auswirkungen auf die heutigen türkischen Juden|year=2009|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-28937-0|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that [[Mehmet II]] imposed the tax in return for separate representation of Jews after 1455, as part of a broader effort to rebuild and revive Istanbul; this may also have served to undermine the Greek patriarchy. Under the Ottoman empire there was, at time, friction between "Greeks" and "Jews"; the authorities may at times have favoured one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ankori, Zvi (1977). Greek Orthodox Theological Review. 22 (1): 17–57. "Greek Orthodox-Jewish Relations in Historic Perspective: The Jewish View." &lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''rav akçesi'' was a cash tax, rather than a tax in kind, it could be [[hypothecation|hypothecated]] to provide specific goods; tax records for 1655 show that the rav akçesi in [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] (Bitola) was a significant source of funding of drapery for [[Janissary|janissaries]]; the tax official responsible for purchases would be the same person responsible for collecting the tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veinstein|first=Gilles|title=Sur la draperie juive de Salonique (XVIe-XVIIe s.)|journal=Revue du monde musulman et de la Méditerranée|year=1992|issue=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims were usually taxed at a higher rate, overall, in the Ottoman empire, thanks to taxes such as rav akçesi and [[ispence]]. Jews in particular may have been singled out to pay higher rates of ispence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical and economic geography of Ottoman Greece: the southwestern Morea in the 18th century|year=2005|publisher=ASCSA|isbn=978-0-87661-534-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was well aware of this - and even aware that this would tempt nonmuslims to convert; [[Bayezit II]] ruled that courts should treat nonmuslims more leniently (including such measures as lower fines), "''so that the poll-tax payers shall not vanish''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heyd|first=Uriel|title=Studies in old Ottoman criminal law|year=1973|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=156, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other [[Taxation in the Ottoman empire|taxes in the Ottoman empire]], rav akçesi could be affected by a complex patchwork of local rules and exemptions, including [[muafiyet]]; the Jews of Selanik ([[Thessaloniki]]) were among those exempted from taxes by a muafname after the city was conquered by [[Murad II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zachariadou|first=Elisavet|authorlink=Elizabeth Zachariadou|title=The Via Egnatia under Ottoman rule (1380-1699)|year=1992|publisher=Crete University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Income Tax Germany 2010.png|thumb|German [[progressive tax]] rates for different incomes. Progressive tax systems require the rich to pay taxes at higher rates, to make it possible to raise larger total sums to pay for governmental functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Investopedia|title=The Advantages of a Progressive Tax|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue such systems are primarily for wealth redistribution.]]

'''Redistribution of income''' and '''redistribution of wealth''' are respectively the transfer of [[income]] and of [[wealth]] (including physical [[property]]) from some [[individual]]s to others by means of a social mechanism such as [[taxation]], [[charity (practice)|charity]], [[welfare]], [[public services]], [[land reform]], [[monetary policies]], [[confiscation]], [[divorce]] or [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/redistribution/ |title=Redistribution |date=2 July 2004 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |publisher=Stanford University |quote=The ''social mechanism'', such as a change in tax laws, monetary policies, or tort law, that engenders the redistribution of goods among these subjects|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically refers to redistribution on an economy-wide basis rather than between selected individuals.

Interpretations of the phrase vary, depending on personal perspectives, political ideologies and the selective use of statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker: Elizabeth Warren’s claim that the bottom 90 percent got ‘zero percent’ of wage growth after Reagan.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/23/elizabeth-warrens-claim-that-the-bottom-90-percent-got-zero-percent-of-wage-growth-after-reagan/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is frequently heard in politics, usually referring to perceived redistributions from those who have more to those who have less.  Occasionally, however, it is used to describe laws or policies that cause opposite redistributions that shift monetary burdens from wealthy to low-income individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Robert|title=Trump’s Stock in Trade is Cruelty. Count the ways.|url=http://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trumps-stock-trade-cruelty-count-ways-594472|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase can be emotionally charged and used to exaggerate or misconstrue the motivations of opponents during political debates.  For example, if an individual politician calls for increased taxes on higher income individuals, their sole focus may be to raise funds for specific government programs, tapping the largest available sources while realizing that low-wage workers have little or no excess income to draw tax revenues from. Political opponents might argue that this politician's prime motivation is to redistribute wealth, when redistribution is not their goal.

The phrase is often coupled with the term "[[Class conflict|class warfare]]," with high income earners and the wealthy portrayed as victims of unfairness and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FAIR|title=For Media, ‘Class War’ Has Wealthy Victims, Rich getting richer seldom labeled as belligerents.|url=http://fair.org/extra/for-media-class-war-has-wealthy-victims/|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redistribution tax policy should not be confused with [[predistribution]] policies.  "Predistribution" is the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities occurring in the first place rather than through the tax and benefits system once they have occurred.  For example, a government predistribution policy might require employers to pay all employees a [[living wage]], not just a [[minimum wage]], as a "bottom-up" response to widespread income inequalities or high poverty rates.

Many alternate taxation proposals have been floated without the political will to alter the status quo. One example is the proposed "[[Buffett Rule]]", which is a hybrid taxation model composed of opposing systems, intended to minimize the favoritism of the special interest tax design.

The effects of a redistribution system are actively debated on ethical and economic grounds. The subject includes analysis of its rationales, objectives, means, and policy effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Cowell ([1987] 2008).  "redistribution of income and wealth," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000067&amp;edition=current&amp;q= TOC.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=January 27, 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 survey among 264 members of the [[American Economic Association]] found that 71.2% of them support redistribution, while 20.4% oppose it, and 7.2% had mixed feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Stern|first2=Charlotta|title=Economists’ policy views and voting|journal=Public Choice|date=2006|volume=126|issue=3-4|page=337|doi=10.1007/s11127-006-7509-6|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/klein/PdfPapers/KS_PublCh06.pdf|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient times, redistribution operated as a [[palace economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lukas|last=de Blois |author2=R.J. van der Spek |translator=Susan Mellor |title=An Introduction to the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|pages=56–60|isbn=0-415-12773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These economies were centrally based around the administration, so the dictator or pharaoh had both the ability and the right to say who was taxed and who got special treatment.

Another early form of wealth redistribution occurred in [[Plymouth Colony]] under the leadership of [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]].&lt;ref name=commoncourse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/william-bradford|title=William Bradford – Facts &amp; Summary |publisher=History.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradford records in his diary that this "common course"&lt;ref name=commoncourse /&gt; bred confusion, discontent, distrust, and the colonists looked upon it as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tYecOAN1cwwC&amp;pg=PA135 ''History of Plymouth Plantation''], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term [[Distributism]] (also known as distributionism or distributivism) is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of [[Catholic social teaching]], especially the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his encyclical ''Rerum novarum'' and [[Pope Pius XI]] in ''Quadragesimo anno''.  More recently, [[Pope Francis]] in his ''Evangelii Gaudium'', echoed the earlier Papal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt III|first1=Arthur W.|title=Pope Francis Needs Distributism: Americans and popes alike can embrace a humane alternative to modern capitalism.|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/pope-francis-needs-distributism/|publisher=The American Conservative|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in economic systems ==
Different types of [[economic system]]s feature varying degrees of interventionism aimed at redistributing income, depending on how unequal their initial distributions of income are. Free-market [[capitalist]] economies tend to feature high degrees of income redistribution. However, Japan's government engages in much less redistribution because its initial wage distribution is much more equal than Western economies. Likewise, the [[socialist]] planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc featured very little income redistribution because private [[Property income|capital and land income]] – the major drivers of income inequality in capitalist systems – was virtually nonexistent; and because the wage rates were set by the government in these economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 11|quote=Economies vary based on the extent to which and the methods by which governments intervene to redistribute income. This depends partly on how unequal income is to begin with before any redistributive policies are implemented. Thus the Japanese government does much less redistributing than the governments of many other capitalist countries because Japan has a more equal distribution of wages than most other capitalist countries. Command socialist economies also have had less income redistribution because governments initially control the distribution of income by setting wages and forbidding capital or land income.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern forms of redistribution ==
Today, income redistribution occurs in some form in most [[Democracy|democratic]] countries through economic policies. Some redistributive policies attempt to take wealth, income, and other resources from the “haves” and give them to the “have-nots,” but many redistributions go elsewhere.

In his article ''Redistribution'',&lt;ref name="Redistribution"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Dwight R.|title=Redistribution|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight R. Lee states:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
“…most government transfers are not from the rich to the poor. Instead, government takes from the relatively unorganized (e.g., consumers and general taxpayers) and gives to the relatively organized (groups politically organized around common interests, such as the elderly, sugar farmers, and steel producers). The most important factor in determining the pattern of redistribution appears to be political influence, not poverty. “

“The direct transfer of cash and services is only one way that government transfers income. Another way is by restricting competition among producers. The inevitable consequence—indeed, the intended consequence—of these restrictions is to enrich organized groups of producers at the expense of consumers. Here, the transfers are more perverse than with Medicare and Social Security. They help relatively wealthy producers at the expense of relatively poor (and, in some cases, absolutely poor) consumers. Many government restrictions on agricultural production, for example, allow farmers to capture billions of consumer dollars through higher food prices (see [[agricultural subsidy]] programs). Most of these dollars go to relatively few large farms, whose owners are far wealthier than the average taxpayer and consumer (or the average farmer). Also, wealthy farmers receive most of the government’s direct agricultural subsidies."

|}

Some consider the U.S. government’s progressive-rate [[income tax]] policy as redistributive, because some of the tax revenue goes to social programs such as welfare and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Christine, and Gerald C. Wright. ''Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics.'' 7th ed.: CQ, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] system, a high income earner will pay a higher tax rate (a larger percentage of their income) than a low income earner; and therefore, will pay more total dollars per person.&lt;ref&gt;Prante, Gerald, and Scott A. Hodge. "The Distribution of Tax and Spending Policies in the United States." Tax Foundation. N.p., 13 Nov. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other taxation-based methods of redistributing income are the [[negative income tax]] for very low income earners and [[tax loopholes]] (tax avoidance) for the better-off.

Two other common types of governmental redistribution of income are [[subsidies]] and [[vouchers]] (such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]). These [[transfer payment]] programs are funded through general taxation, but benefit the poor or influential special interest groups and corporations.&lt;ref name="Redistribution"/&gt; While the persons receiving transfers from such programs may prefer to be directly given cash, these programs may be more palatable to society than cash assistance, as they give society some measure of control over how the funds are spent.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey S. Rosen &amp; Ted Gayer, Public Finance pp. 271–72 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the U.S. [[Social security|Social Security]] program redistributes income from the rich to the poor,  but the majority of those receiving Social Security earned their benefits through tax withholding from their paychecks or quarterly income statements, and most benefits are indexed to the actual earning levels of individual workers.  Only the highest- and lowest-income workers fall outside normal rates.  In addition, Social Security deductions are only taken from the first $200,000 in income, with nothing further taken from higher incomes over that amount. In other words, a person who earns $100 million a year pays the same Social Security tax as another worker who earns $200,000 a year.

Contrary to popular belief, a recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balls|first1=Andrew|title=Social Security Does Not Redistribute Income|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html#navDiv=6|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, overall, the Social Security System was slightly regressive against the poor and not redistributive, once important factors were taken into account (for example, the longer life expectancy of the wealthy when compared to the poor gives them more years to collect benefits).

Governmental redistribution of income may include a direct benefit program involving either cash transfers or the purchase of specific services for an individual. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Rector, Robert. "The Redistributive State: The Allocation of Government Benefits, Services, and Taxes in the United States." The Heritage Foundation. N.p., 15 Sept. 2015. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare is a government-run health insurance program that covers people age 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with [[end-stage renal disease]] (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD). This is a direct benefit program because the government is directly providing health insurance for those who qualify.

The difference between the [[Gini index]] for the [[income distribution]] before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Wealth redistribution can be implemented through [[land reform]] that transfers ownership of land from one category of people to another, or through [[inheritance tax]]es or direct [[wealth tax]]es. Before-and-after Gini coefficients for the [[distribution of wealth]] can be compared.

==Objectives==
The objectives of income redistribution are to increase economic stability and opportunity for the less wealthy members of society and thus usually include the funding of [[public services]].

One basis for redistribution is the concept of [[distributive justice]], whose premise is that money and resources ought to be distributed in such a way as to lead to a [[socially just]], and possibly more financially [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], society. Another argument is that a larger [[middle class]] benefits an economy by enabling more people to be [[consumer]]s, while providing equal opportunities for individuals to reach a better standard of living. Seen for example in the work of [[John Rawls]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} another argument is that a truly fair society would be organized in a manner benefiting the least advantaged, and any inequality would be permissible only to the extent that it benefits the least advantaged.

Some proponents of redistribution argue that [[capitalism]] results in an [[externality]] that creates unequal wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. A. ,''Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=December 2011}} argue that wealth and income inequality are a cause of [[economic crises]], and that reducing these inequalities is one way to prevent or ameliorate economic crises, with redistribution thus benefiting the economy overall. This view was associated with the [[underconsumptionism]] school in the 19th century, now considered an aspect of some schools of [[Keynesian economics]]; it has also been advanced, for different reasons, by [[Marxian economics]]. It was particularly advanced in the US in the 1920s by [[Waddill Catchings]] and [[William Trufant Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dorfman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title= Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics.

There is currently a great debate concerning the extent to which the world's extremely rich have become richer over recent decades. Thomas Piketty's ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' is at the forefront, critiqued in certain publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Forget the 1%; Free Exchange", ''The Economist'', 8 November 2014, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral obligation ===

[[Peter Singer]]'s argument contrasts to Thomas Pogge's in that he states we have an individual moral obligation to help the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.net/singer/by/1972----.htm|title=Famine, Affluence, and Morality, by Peter Singer|first=Pablo|last=Stafforini|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/fighting-poverty|title=Fighting Poverty|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, British researchers [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]] show a correlation between income inequality and higher rates of health and social problems ([[obesity]], [[mental illness]], [[homicide]]s, [[teenage birth]]s, [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration]], child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods ([[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy]], educational performance, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust among strangers]], [[Women's rights#2011 study of status by country|women's status]], [[social mobility]], even numbers of [[patent]]s issued per capita), on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resources/slides|title=The Spirit Level - The Equality Trust|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue inequality leads to the social ills through the psychosocial [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], [[Social status|status]] anxiety it creates.&lt;ref name=thinktanks&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/14/the-spirit-level-equality-thinktanks "The Spirit Level: how 'ideas wreckers' turned book into political punchbag"], Robert Booth, ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[International Monetary Fund]] by Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry found a strong association between lower levels of inequality and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries (such as Brazil, Cameroon, Jordan) with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf "Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin?"] Andrew G.

==Criticism==
[[Public choice]] theory states that redistribution tends to benefit those with political clout to set spending priorities more than those in need, who lack real influence on government.&lt;ref&gt;Plotnick, Robert (1986) "An Interest Group Model of Direct Income Redistribution", ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', vol. 68, no. 4, pp. 594–602.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] criticize redistribution via taxation in the context of [[Nordic model|Nordic-style]] [[social democracy]], highlighting its limited success at promoting relative egalitarianism and its lack of sustainability. They point out that social democracy requires a strong labor movement to sustain its heavy redistribution, and that it is unrealistic to expect such redistribution to be feasible in countries with weaker labor movements. They point out that, even in the Scandinavian countries, social democracy has been in decline since the labor movement weakened. Instead, Roemer and Bardhan argue that changing the patterns of enterprise ownership and [[market socialism]], obviating the need for redistribution, would be more sustainable and effective at promoting egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation", by Pranab Bardhan and Johen E. Roemer. 1992. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', vol. 6, no. 3, p. 104: "Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] argue that social democratic reforms – including policies to redistribute income – such as unemployment benefits and high taxes on profits and the wealthy create more contradictions in capitalism by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system via reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism 1998. P.60-61"&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. pp. 60–61: "The Marxist answers that...it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the [[reserve army of labour]], taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion)."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Marxist view, redistribution cannot resolve the fundamental issues of capitalism – only a transition to a socialist economy can.

The '''right to the city''' is an idea and a slogan that was first proposed by [[Henri Lefebvre]] in his 1968 book ''Le Droit à la ville'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Purcell | first = Mark | title = Excavating Lefebvre: The right to the city and its urban politics of the inhabitant | journal = [[GeoJournal]], special issue: Social Transformation, Citizenship, and the Right to the City | volume = 58 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 99–108 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/B:GEJO.0000010829.62237.8f | jstor = 41147756 | date = October 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:GEJO.0000010829.62237.8f3 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mpurcell/geojournal.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Unger | first = Knut | title =  "Right to the City" as a response to the crisis: "Convergence" or divergence of urban social movements? | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120310001029/http://www.reclaiming-spaces.org/crisis/archives/266 | archive-date = 10 March 2012 | url = http://www.reclaiming-spaces.org/crisis/archives/266 | publisher = Reclaiming Spaces | date = 14 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that has been reclaimed more recently by social movements, thinkers and several progressive local authorities alike as a call to action to reclaim the city as a co-created space—a place for life detached from the growing effects that [[commodification]] and [[capitalism]] has had over social interaction and the rise of [[Spatial inequality|spatial inequalities]] in worldwide cities throughout the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/53/david-harvey-the-right-to-the-city|title=David Harvey: The Right to the City. New Left Review 53, September-October 2008.|website=newleftreview.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first inception of the concept, Lefevbre paid specific emphasis on the effects that capitalism had over “the city”, whereas urban life was downgraded into a commodity, social interaction became increasingly uprooted and urban space and governance were turned into exclusive goods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capitanswing.com/libros/el-derecho-a-la-ciudad/|title=El derecho a la ciudad  {{!}}  Capitán Swing|last=Swing|first=Capitán|website=capitanswing.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to this trend, Lefevbre called to “''rescue the citizen as main element and protagonist of the city that he himself had built''” and to transform urban space into “''a meeting point for building collective life''”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to the inequalities produced by the rapid increase of world urban population in most regions of the world, the concept of the right to the city has been recalled on several occasions since the publication of Lefevbre’s book as a call to action by social movements and grassroots organizations. In their appeal for “their right to the city”, local mobilizations around the world usually refer to their struggle for social justice and a dignified access to urban life face to growing urban inequalities (especially in large metropolitan concepts). The right to the city has had a particular influence in [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]], where social movements have particularly appealed to the concept in their actions and promoted local instruments for advancing its concrete understanding in terms of policy-making at the local and even national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/competitive-metropolises-and-prospects-spatial-justice|title=Competitive Metropolises and the Prospects for Spatial Justice {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=11668|title=What Is The Right to the City? {{!}} RioOnWatch|website=www.rioonwatch.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good proof on how the notion of right to the city has gained international recognition in the last years could be seen in the [[United Nations]] [[Habitat III]] process, and how the [[New Urban Agenda]] (2016) recognized the concept as the vision of “cities for all”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/20/habitat-3-right-city-concrete-policies-ada-colau|title=After Habitat III: a stronger urban future must be based on the right to the city|last=Colau|first=Ada|date=2016-10-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing popularity of the concept has nonetheless raised some criticism and concerns on how the original vision of Henri Lefevbre could be reduced to a “citizenship vision”, focused on the mere implementation of social and economic rights in the city leaving aside its transformatory nature and the concept of social conflict behind the original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/03/16/seres_urbanos/1521194122_492095.html|title=Elogio y rescate de Henri Lefebvre|last=Delgado|first=Manuel|date=2018-03-19|work=El País|access-date=2018-06-14|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Gorgens | first1 = Tristan | last2 = van Donk | first2 = Mirjam | title = From basic needs towards socio-spatial transformation: coming to grips with the 'Right to the City' for the urban poor in South Africa | url = http://isandla.org.za/publications/152/ | website = isandla.org.za | publisher = The Isandla Institute | date = 2011 }} [http://isandla.org.za/download/assets/gorgens_and_van_donk_isandla_institute_acc-cubes_conference_paper.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcelo Lopes de Souza]] has for instance argued that as the right to the city has become "''fashionable these days''", "''the price of this has often been the trivialisation and corruption of Lefebvre's concept''"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lopes de Souza | first = Marcelo | title = Which right to which city?

==Overview==
Lefebvre summarizes the idea as a "demand...[for] a transformed and renewed access to urban life".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lefebvre | first = Henri | author-link = Henri Lefebvre | contribution = The right to the city | editor-last1 = Kofman | editor-first1 = Eleonore | editor-last2 = Lebas | editor-first2 = Elizabeth | title = Writings on cities | page = 158 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780631191889 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attoh | first = Kafui | title = What ''kind'' of right is the right to the city? | journal = [[Progress in Human Geography]] | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–685 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0309132510394706 | date = October 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309132510394706 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] described it as follows:
{{quote|The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is, moreover, a common rather than an individual right since this transformation inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23647">The emergence of [[social media]] has changed the way in which political communication takes place in the [[Politics of the United States|United States]]. Political institutions such as politicians, [[political parties]], foundations, institutions, and political [[think tank]]s are all using social media platforms, like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], to communicate with and engage voters. Regular individuals, politicians, "[[pundit]]s" and [[thought leader]]s alike are able to voice their opinions, engage with a wide network, and connect with other likeminded individuals.&lt;ref name="Kearney2013"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kearney|first=Michael||date=2013|title=Political Discussion on Facebook: An Analysis of Interpersonal Goals and Disagreement|publisher= University of Kansas|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1808/12975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The active participation of social media users has been an increasingly important element in political communication, especially during political elections in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Skogerbø &amp; Arne H. Krumsvik, "Newspapers, Facebook and Twitter: Intermedial agenda setting in local election campaigns," Journalism Practice (2015) 9#3 DOI:10.1080/17512786.2014.950471&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media are changing the nature of political communication because they are tools that can be used to inform and mobilize users in new ways. Users are able to connect directly to politicians and campaign managers and engage in political activities in new ways. Each social media platform is programmed in code by developers, creating a unique digital architecture that influences how politicians and citizens can use the platform for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossetta|first=Michael|date=March 2018|title=The Digital Architectures of Social Media: Comparing Political Campaigning on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in the 2016 U.S. Election|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077699018763307|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=95(2)|pages=471-496|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by simply pressing the "[[like button]]" on [[Facebook]] or by following someone on [[Twitter]], users have the ability to connect with others and express their views in new ways. The option for users to share, like, or [[retweet]] political messages instantly has opened up a new avenue for politicians to reach out to voters. At the same time, social media campaigns can carry risks that are not present on traditional platforms, such as TV or newspaper ads. Whereas the political party controls all of the messaging on a TV or newspaper ad, in a social media campaign, critics and opposing party supporters can post negative comments immediately below campaign messages.

Politicians have a platform to communicate with that is different from the mainstream media. Politicians have the ability to raise large amounts of money in relatively short periods of time through social media campaigns. In 2012 president Obama raised over a billion dollars for his campaign, which broke the fundraising record. Around $690 million was raised through online donations including social media, email, and website donations and more money was raised from small donors than ever before.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scherer, Michael. “Exclusive: Obama’s 2012 Digital Fundraising Outperformed 2008.” Time.

==Influence on elections==

===Early history===
Democrat [[Howard Dean]] is credited with being the first politician to use the Internet for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;”Campaign 2.0” Webspace at University of Texas at Austin.  April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Dean served as the Governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and decided to run for president for the 2004 election. Dean is credited with organizing the first campaign website, acting as a virtual headquarters for fundraising and volunteer recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Hindman, Matthew. “The Real Lessons of Howard Dean: Reflections on the First Digital Campaign.” Perspectives on Politics, 2005, p.121-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean’s website had a number of online metrics of success including the hits on his homepage, weblogs, campaign sign-ups, house parties and meet ups.&lt;ref&gt;Rospars, Joe. “How Howard Dean’s Scream Helped Obama Land The Presidency.” Time Magazine. July 1, 2014. http://time.com/2946448/howard-dean-scream-obama-president/&lt;/ref&gt; Dean’s supporters hosted house parties and invited individuals to learn about Dean’s campaign. Dean also encouraged use of the website [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]] for his upstart presidential campaign in 2002, making it easy for people "with a common interest to find each other and arrange to meet, face to face".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Individuals would attend face-to-face meetings to learn more about his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cornfield, Michael. “The Internet and Campaign: A Look Back at the Campaigners”.  Pew Research Center, 2005, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people coming out to Dean's Meetups in 600 location across the country ultimately reached about 143,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 75,000 individuals attended these meet-ups and more than 96% of respondents reported that they wished to become actively involved in Dean’s campaign. The engagement in face-to-face local groups "dramatically affected how involved volunteers got with the campaign. The more Meetups people attended, the higher their average donation to the campaign".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/07/tech/web/meetup-2012-campaign-sifry/|title=From Howard Dean to the tea party: The power of Meetup.com|website=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network.|last1=Sifry|first1=Micah|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean won a "digital" [[primary election]] that was held on [[MoveOn.org]] with 44% of the votes. His success in the primary generated positive coverage by the news media. This early victory was important to the momentum of the campaign. Dean’s campaign was also viewed as a success for his ability to raise large amounts of money in small increments. In January 2004, his campaign had raised $41 million from supporters mostly online. A total of 318,884 individuals contributed to his campaign, with over 61% of the contributions under $200. Less than 1% of individuals gave $2,000, which was the federal limit.&lt;ref name=FEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Contribution Limits for 2003-2004|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/ContributionLimits2003-2004.htm|website=FEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dean’s fundraising behavior was opposite of his rivals. [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] raised $130.8 million in 2003 and 68% of his donations were the maximum donation limit.&lt;ref&gt;Justice, Glen. “Campaign Fund-Raising; Financial Firms are Bush’s Biggest Donors, Study Reports.”The New York Times.  January 9, 2004. https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/09/us/2004-campaign-fund-raising-financial-firms-are-bush-s-biggest-donors-study.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political Origins of Facebook===
[[Mark Zuckerberg]] served as a field organizer for Democrat [[John Kerry]] in the 2004 presidential election.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Slotnick, Allison. “Friend the President”.  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zuckerberg was responsible for [[Get out the vote]] and mobilization efforts.  Facebook was launched the same year. The [[Facebook Platform]] relies on group formation and constant communication, both of which are goals for any political campaign.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
[[Chris Hughes]], a founding member and developer at Facebook, left the company to work as an advisor for President Barack Obama. While working at Facebook, Hughes designed a Facebook profile for the then presidential candidate. Following his departure, Hughes worked on Obama’s Facebook page and utilized his knowledge of [[content management]] and new developments to outpace other candidates in relation to their online presence.&lt;ref&gt;McGirt, Ellen. “How Chris Hughes helped launch Facebook and the Barack Obama Campaign.” Fast Company Magazine. April 2009. http://www.fastcompany.com/1207594/how-chris-hughes-helped-launch-facebook-and-barack-obama-campaign&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes created the website MyBarak0bama.com which had a similar layout and concept as Facebook.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== 2008 Presidential Election ===
The 2008 presidential election was the first election in which candidates utilized the Internet and social media as a tool for their campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, David. “How Obama Tapped Into Social Networks’ Power.” New York Times. November 9, 2008. https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10carr.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Then President-elect Barack Obama was the first to use the Internet to organize supporters, advertise, and communicate with individuals in a way that had been impossible in previous elections.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Miller, Claire Cain. “How Obama’s Internet Campaign Changed Politics.” New York Times. November 7, 2008. http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/how-obamas-internet-campaign-changed-politics/&lt;/ref&gt; Obama utilized sites like [[YouTube]] to advertise through videos. The videos posted on YouTube by Obama’s were viewed for 14.5 million hours.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Jessica. “The YouTube Election.” Newsweek. November 9, 2008. http://www.newsweek.com/youtube-election-85069&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Presidential Election===
By the 2012 election more candidates were utilizing a wider array of social media platforms.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Fouhy, Beth. “Elections 2012: The Social Network, Presidential Campaign Edition.” Huffington Post. April 17, 2011 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/17/elections-2012-social-media_n_850172.html&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians were now on social networking sites like [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]] and other new social media tools and [[mobile apps]]. Some of the candidates used social media sites to announce their candidacy. [[Barack Obama]] emailed a video to 13 million when he announced his intention to run for re-election and [[Mitt Romney]]  sent out a [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweet]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Other candidates posted on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to announce their candidacy.

There is a clear difference between the Obama and Romney campaign's presence on social media throughout the 2012 campaign. In October 2012, President Obama had over 20 million followers on [[Twitter]] and Romney had 1.2 million. On [[Facebook]] Obama had over 29 million likes on his page and Romney had 7.9 million. On [[Instagram]] Obama had 1.4 million followers and Romney had 38,000 followers. President Obama had higher followers on all of his other social media accounts including [[Spotify]] [[Pinterest]] and [[YouTube]],&lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Jenna. “The Presidential Campaign on Social Media.” The New York Times. October 8, 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/08/technology/campaign-social-media.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; though research suggests merely following Obama or Romney on social media sites such as Facebook may have had little influence on voter behaviors.&lt;ref name="Pennington2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennington|first1=Natalie|last2=Winfrey|first2=Kelly| last3=Warner|first3=Benjamin|last4=Kearney|first4=Michael|title=Liking Obama and Romney (on Facebook): An experimental evaluation of political engagement and efficacy during the 2012 general election|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=44|year=2015|pages=279–283|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama also utilized his social media accounts more than any other candidate online.&lt;ref&gt;“How the Presidential Candidates Use the Web and Social Media: Obama Leads but Neither Candidate Engages in Much Dialogue with Voters.” Pew Research Center Journalism &amp; Media. August 15, 2012 http:// www.journalism.org/2012/08/15/how-presidential-candidates-use-web-and-social-media/&lt;/ref&gt; He actively posted more on Twitter, YouTube and on his personal website [[blog]].

President Obama’s campaign thrived on online donations in both 2008 and 2012. In 2008 3.95 million people donated to president Obama’s campaign.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; That number reached 4.4 million people during his 2012 campaign. The total online donation also rose from $500 million in 2008 to $690 million in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===2016 Presidential campaign===
{{main|Social media in the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign}}

===Limitations and constraints===
[[Social media]] has been used in political campaigns ranging from small local elections to larger-scale presidential elections. According to [[Wael Ghonim]], social media can reinforce pre-existing beliefs rather than promote new ones. Social media, while a great source of gathering volunteers and money, serves the main purpose of affirming political beliefs and strengthening a political base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another limitation of the way social media is used in political campaigns is that politicians cannot control the conversation. According to a study by Miguel del Fresno García, Alan J. Daly, and Sagrario Segado Sánchez-Cabezudo, regular friends and followers hold high levels of influence on social media, instead of blogs and campaign pages. Users with the most influence over social media fall into three different categories: users who disseminate knowledge, those who engage other people, and those who lead conversations. These three types of users are the ones who others tend to follow and listen to through social media. Therefore, for political campaigns to truly reach as many people as possible, political groups first need to get those three users talking about their campaigns on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While "critics [may] worry that governance by social media will cheapen the power of the presidency by substituting hashtag activism for serious policymaking," President Obama's Administration has been credited with successfully "[leveraging] the opportunities of the digital age to maximum political advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2015/05/26/heres-how-the-first-president-of-the-social-media-age-has-chosen-to-connect-with-americans/|title=Here's how the first president of the social media age has chosen to connect with Americans|website=The Washington Post|publisher=WP Company LLC|last1=Eilperin|first1=Juliet|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==
Scandals have been a part of the American political system since its inception (see [[List of federal political scandals in the United States]]). [[Political scandals]] are events that capture a lot of attention and eventually disappear over and are the source of intense public communication. The media has subsequently played an important role in both the breaking of these stories and the coverage they receive. In recent decades there have been an increased number of scandals relating to the Internet and social media.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Arsenault, Amelia. “Scandal Politics in the New Media Environment” Analytical Note: Scandal Politics Review. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most notable political scandal related to social media has been the demise of Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] in 2011. Weiner, a Democrat from New York, sent a link of a suggestive photograph to a woman on his public Twitter account. The tweet and picture were then sent to [[Andrew Breitbart]] , a conservative blogger, who posted them to his website before Weiner had a chance to take the tweet down.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Alex. “Weinergate: Anatomy of Social Media Scandal” Time.  May 31, 2011. http://swampland.time.com/2011/05/31/weinergate-anatomy-of-a-social-media-scandal/&lt;/ref&gt; Within days the Anthony Weiner incident became national news. The scandal, nicknamed [[Weinergate]],  is widely considered to be the first political sex scandal to come about as a result of social media.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, William. “Weinergate’s Lasting Impact: The First Big Social Media Political Sex Scandal.” Huffington Post. June 7, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/weinergates-lasting-impac_b_872585.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political scandals have emerged as a result of social media. [[Joe Miller (Alaska politician)|Joe Miller]] a Senate candidate from Alaska tweeted about decorating his office prior to any announcement that he had won the race. Miller deleted the tweets, but not before a blogger was able to screen shot them. Miller eventually lost the election.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Bosker, Bianca. “The Most Embarrassing Politician Twitter Scandals.” The Huffington Post. August 3, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/03/politicians-top-twitter-s_n_870967.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meg Whitman]] a Republican candidate in California was embarrassed following a tweet sent out by her press secretary that included a YouTube video of a cross-dressed musician. Whitman lost the election to [[Jerry Brown]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; [[Pete Hoekstra]], a Michigan Congressman, got into trouble after tweeting throughout a trip to [[Iraq]], in which he breached security by posting confidential details about the visit.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; There is a changing nature of political scandals that has resulted from the increased use of social media and the Internet. Politicians are increasingly more vulnerable online as the separation between public and private life has quickly diminished in the increasingly more connected world.&lt;ref&gt;Lunt and Livingstone. Media and Communications Regulation &amp; The Public Interest. Sage Publication. April 4, 2011 http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/45145_Lunt_and_Livingstone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Political scandals are shifting from illegal or corrupt activities towards personal missteps no longer about illegal or corrupt activities.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

on October 26, 2018 social network Facebook announced that it has deleted 82 accounts created in [[Iran]] that included posts advocating harsh issues such as race, immigration, and U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], . . ..  just before U.S. congressional elections on November 6.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.radiofarda.com/a/facebook-deletes-iran-linked-accounts-followed-by-1-million-us-britain-political-divisive-sow-discord/29566728.html Facebook Deletes Iran-Linked Accounts Followed By 1 Million In U.S., Britain]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a timeline of the background of the '''Taliban's rise to power'''.

It details the [[Taliban]] movement's origins in [[Pashtun nationalism]], and briefly relates its ideological underpinnings with that of broader Afghan society.

It details the Taliban's consolidation of power, listing persecutions by the Taliban officials during its five years in power in Afghanistan and during its war with the [[Northern Alliance]].

==Contact with Pakistan's ISI==
During the power vacuum created by the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan]] in 1989, the country was torn apart by warring [[mujahideen]] groups and the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] of Pakistan grasped the chance to wield power in the region by fostering a previously unknown [[Kandahar]]i student movement.&lt;ref name="telegraphgodfathers"&gt;{{cite news

Taliban initially enjoyed enormous good will from Afghans weary of the corruption, brutality, and the incessant fighting of [[Mujahideen]] warlords.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world / editor in chief, Richard C. Martin, Macmillan Reference USA : Thomson/Gale, c2004&lt;/ref&gt; One story is that the rape and murder of boys and girls from a family traveling to Kandahar or a similar outrage by Mujahideen bandits sparked [[Mohammed Omar]] (Mullah Omar) and his students to vow to rid Afghanistan of these criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994-1997'', Oxford University Press, (1999), pp.25–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Another motivation was that the Pakistan-based truck shipping mafia known as the "Afghanistan Transit Trade" and their allies in the Pakistan government, trained, armed, and financed the Taliban to clear the southern road across Afghanistan to the Central Asian Republics of extortionate bandit gangs.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), 25-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many senior leaders of the Afghanistan [[Taliban]] were closely associated with and had attended the [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]] seminary in [[Akora Khattak]] in Pakistan, including [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], and its role in supporting the Taliban.&lt;ref name="jamestown"&gt;{{FIL-Luge link

After [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)#Soviet intervention and withdrawal|the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979]], Islamic [[mujahideen]] fighters engaged in war with those Soviet forces. Some of those Islamic fighters would later transform into the [[Taliban]] according to Professor [[Carole Hillenbrand]] who stated: "The West helped the Taliban to fight the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hillenbrand|2015|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there isn't any evidence that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] directly supported the Taliban or [[Al Qaeda]], some basis for military support of the Taliban was provided when, in the early 1980s, the CIA and the ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency) provided arms to Afghans resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the ISI assisted the process of gathering radical Muslims from around the world to fight against the Soviets.&lt;ref name='R000321'&gt;{{cite news | first=Joseph | last=Fitchett | coauthors= | title=What About the Taliban's Stingers? | date=26 September 2001 | publisher= | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/news/what-about-the-talibans-stingers.html | work=[[The International Herald Tribune]] | pages= | accessdate=2008-11-11 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017145308/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/26/news/what-about-the-talibans-stingers.html | archivedate=17 October 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama Bin Laden]] was one of the key players in organizing training camps for the foreign Arab volunteers, although his organization, [[Maktab al-Khidamat]], was exclusively Saudi funded.&lt;ref name=DID-THE-US-CREATE-OSAMA-BIN-LADEN&gt;{{cite web|title=Did the U.S. "Create" Osama bin Laden? |date=2005-01-14 |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html |accessdate=2007-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310111109/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2005/Jan/24-318760.html |archivedate=March 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BERGEN-BIN-LADEN-CIA-LINKS-HOGWASH&gt;{{Cite news

The Taliban were based in the [[Helmand Province|Helmand]], [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]], and [[Uruzgan Province|Uruzgan]] regions and were overwhelmingly ethnic Pashtuns and predominantly [[Durrani]] Pashtuns.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence in Afghanistan==
The first major military activity of the Taliban was in October–November 1994 when they marched from [[Maywand District|Maiwand]] in southern Afghanistan to capture [[Kandahar|Kandahar City]] and the surrounding provinces, losing only a few dozen men.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'', (2000) pp.27–9&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the capture of a border crossing and a huge ammunition dump from warlord [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], a few weeks later they freed "a convoy trying to open a trade route from Pakistan to Central Asia" from another group of warlords attempting to extort money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/taliban.html |title=The Taliban — |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next three months this hitherto "unknown force" took control of twelve of Afghanistan's 34 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provinces]], with Mujahideen warlords often surrendering to them without a fight and the "heavily armed population" giving up their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.1&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1996 they had captured Afghanistan's capital, [[Kabul]].

==Consolidation of power==
Under the Taliban regime, [[Sharia law]] was interpreted to ban a wide variety of activities hitherto lawful in Afghanistan: employment, education and sports for women, movies, television, videos, music, dancing, hanging pictures in homes, clapping during sports events, kite flying, and beard trimming. One Taliban list of prohibitions included: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;pork, pig, pig oil, anything made from human hair, satellite dishes, cinematography, and equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computers, VCRs, television, anything that propagates sex and is full of music, wine, lobster, nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Waldman, `No TV, no Chess, No Kites: Taliban's Code, from A to Z,` ''New York Times'', 22 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Wikiquote|religious police}}

Men were required to have a beard extending farther than a fist clamped at the base of the chin. On the other hand, they had to wear their head hair short. Men were also required to wear a head covering.&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8222.htm |title=US Country Report on Human Rights Practices - Afghanistan 2001 |publisher=State.gov |date=2002-03-04 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possession was forbidden of depictions of living things, whether drawings, paintings or photographs, stuffed animals, and dolls.&lt;ref name="cr" /&gt;
 
These rules were issued by the [[Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Afghanistan)|Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Suppression of Vice]] (PVSV) and enforced by its "religious police," a concept thought to be borrowed from the [[Wahhabi]]s. In newly conquered towns hundreds of religious police beat offenders (typically men without beards and women who were not wearing their burqas properly) with long sticks.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

Theft was punished by the amputation of a hand, rape and murder by public execution. Married adulterers were stoned to death. In Kabul, punishments were carried out in front of crowds in the city's former [[soccer stadium]].

===Treatment of women===
{{main|Taliban treatment of women}}

Women in particular were targets of the Taliban's restrictions. They were prohibited from working; from wearing clothing regarded as "stimulating and attractive," including the "Iranian [[chador]]," (viewed as insufficiently complete in its covering); from taking a taxi without a "close male relative" (''[[mahram]]''); washing clothes in streams; or having their measurements taken by tailors.&lt;ref name="Rashid218"&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), pp.218–9. See the full edict here: [http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/taliban_in_their_own_words.html The Taliban In Their Own Words]&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment of women was restricted to the medical sector because male medical personnel were not allowed to examine women.  One result of the Taliban's ban on employment of women was the closing down of many primary schools, in places such as Kabul, not only for girls but for boys too, because almost all the teachers there were women.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were also not permitted to attend co-educational schools; in practice, this prevented the vast majority of young women and girls in Afghanistan from receiving even a [[primary education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7799926.stm | work=BBC News | title=Taleban 'will kill school girls' | date=26 December 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s1oWlA3xeg |title=Taliban Threatening girls again |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were made to wear the [[burqa]], a traditional dress covering the entire body, with a small screen covering the face through which the wearer could see. Taliban restrictions became more severe after they took control of the capital. In February 1998, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul and issued new regulations ordering "householders to blacken their windows, so women would not be visible from the outside."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; 
Home schools for girls, which had been allowed to continue, were forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, the Taliban stopped all women from attending general hospitals,&lt;ref name=taliban71&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the use of one all-women hospital in Kabul. There were many reports of Muslim women being beaten by the Taliban for violating the Taliban interpretation of the [[Sharia]].

=== Prohibitions on culture ===
[[Movie theater]]s were closed and music was banned. Hundreds of cultural artifacts that were deemed [[polytheistic]] were also destroyed including a major museum and countless private art collections.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample Taliban edict issued after their capture of Kabul is one decreed in December 1996 by the "General Presidency of Amr Bil Maruf and Nahi Anil Munkar" (or Religious Police) banning a variety of things and activities: music, shaving of beards, keeping of pigeons, flying kites, displaying of pictures or portraits, western hairstyles, music and dancing at weddings, gambling, "sorcery," and not praying at prayer times.&lt;ref name="Rashid218" /&gt; In February 2001, Taliban used sledgehammers to destroy representational works of art at the National Museum of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=loomingtowers337&gt;Wright, ''Looming Towers'' (2006), p.337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local festivities were not exempt from prohibitions. The Taliban banned the traditional Afghan New Year's celebrations and "for a time they also banned [Ashura] the Shia Islamic month of mourning and even restricted any show of festivity at [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]]."&lt;ref name="Rashid115"&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban,'' (2000), pp.115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Afghan people were not allowed to have any cultural celebrations if  women were present. If there were only men at the celebration it would be allowed, so long as it ended by  7:00 p.m, a set time.

Many Taliban officials wanted to give entertain or said they did but they wanted it to be set by them and guided by the holy religion.

====Buddhas of Bamiyan====
{{Main|Buddhas of Bamiyan}}

In March 2001, the Taliban ordered the demolition of two statues of [[Buddharupa|Buddhas]] carved into cliffsides at [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan]], one 38 metres (125&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and carved in 507 CE, the other 53 metres (174&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and carved in 554 CE. The act was condemned by [[UNESCO]] and many countries around the world.

The intentions of the destruction remain unclear. Mullah Omar initially supported the preservation of Afghanistan's [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], and [[Japan]] linked financial aid to the preservation of the statues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pakistan and Japan plead for Afghan statues | date=2001-03-09 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/09/afghanistan.destruction/ | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | accessdate=2007-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a few years, a [[decree]] was issued claiming all representations of humans and idols, including those in museums, must be destroyed in accordance with Islamic law which prohibits any form of [[idolatry|idol worship]].

The government of Pakistan (itself host to one of the richest and most ancient collections of Buddhist art) implored the Taliban to spare the statues. Saudi Arabia and the [[United Arab Emirates]] later denounced the act as savage.

[[Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi]], a senior representative of the Taliban designated as the roving [[Ambassador]], visited the US in March, 2001. He portrayed the Taliban's action not as an act of irrationality, but as an act of rage over UNESCO and some western governments denying the Taliban use of the funds meant for the repairs of the war-damaged statues of the Buddha. He contended that the Taliban intended to use the money for drought relief.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.robert-fisk.com/taliban_lecture.htm Transcript] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025030742/http://www.robert-fisk.com/taliban_lecture.htm |date=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Taliban spent much money and effort on destroying the statues, resources which they could have instead used for drought relief.

===Ethnic massacres and persecution===
The worst attack on civilians came in summer of 1998 when the Taliban swept north from [[Herat]] to the predominantly Hazara and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] city of [[Mazari Sharif|Mazar-i-Sharif]], the largest city in the north. Entering at 10 am on 8 August 1998, for the next two days the Taliban drove their pickup trucks "up and down the narrow streets of Mazar-i-Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that moved — shop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys."&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 8000 noncombatants  were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in [[Bamiyan]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodson, ''Afghanistan's Endless War,'' (2001), p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immediate burial, the Taliban forbade anyone to bury the corpses for the first six days while they rotted in the summer heat and were eaten by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-02.htm#P114_24041 THE MASSACRE IN MAZAR-I SHARIF, THE FIRST DAY OF THE TAKEOVER].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this indiscriminate slaughter, the Taliban sought out and [[massacre]]d members of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]], a mostly Shia ethnic group, while in control of Mazar-i-Sharif.

While the slaughter can be attributed to several factors – ethnic difference, suspicion of Hazara loyalty to their co-religionists in Iran, fury at the loss of life suffered in an earlier unsuccessful Taliban takeover of Mazar – the belief by some [[Sunni]] Taliban that the [[Shia]] Hazaras were guilty of ''[[takfir]]'' (apostasy) may have been the principal motivation. It was expressed by Mullah Niazi, the commander of the attack and governor of Mazar after the attack, in his declaration from Mazar's central mosque:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now we have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.&lt;ref name = "hrw.org-Niazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364 |title=Human Rights Watch Report, `Afghanistan, the massacre in Mazar-e-Sharif`, November 1998. INCITEMENT OF VIOLENCE AGAINST HAZARAS BY GOVERNOR NIAZI |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hazara also suffered a [[siege]] by the Taliban of their [[Hazarajat]] homeland in central Afghanistan and the refusal by the Taliban to allow the UN to supply food to Hazara in the provinces of Bamiyan, [[Ghor]], [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]] and [[Ghazni]].&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.68&lt;/ref&gt; A month after the Mazar slaughter, Taliban broke through Hazar lines and took over Hazarajat. The number of civilians killed was not as great as in Mazar, but occurred nevertheless.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years that followed, massacres of Hazara by Taliban forces were documented by groups such as [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/ |title=Afghanistan |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conscription===

     {{Voting}}

'''Voter segments in political polling''' in the United States consist of '''all adults''', '''registered voters''', and '''likely voters'''.

==Definitions==
Political opinion polling in the United States usually surveys one of three population segments. 
* '''All adults''' are polls in which all Americans age 18 and older have been surveyed. These polls represent the aggregate opinion of all United States residents, regardless of voting eligibility or intent.&lt;ref name="gal1"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between registered voters and likely voters?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/110287/what-difference-between-registered-voters-likely-voters.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt; 
* '''Registered voters''' are polls in which only Americans who are [[voting registration|registered to vote]] are surveyed. These polls represent the aggregate opinion only of citizens who would be legally able to cast a vote if the election were held on the day the poll was taken and, therefore, necessarily exclude non-citizen residents and, in many jurisdictions, the mentally ill and convicted felons.&lt;ref name="gal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt; 
* '''Likely voters''' are polls in which only Americans who are (a) registered voters, and who, (b) have indicated a high intent of actually voting in the next election, are surveyed.&lt;ref name="gal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aapor"/&gt;

==Relative values==
According to the [[American Association for Public Opinion Research]], "there is a consensus in the polling community that it is better to report 'likely' voters than '[[Registered Voter|registered]]' voters".&lt;ref name="aapor"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Election-Polling-Resources/Likely-Voters.aspx|title=Likely Voters|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[American Association for Public Opinion Research]]|access-date=|quote=There is a consensus in the polling community that it is better to report "likely" voters than "registered" voters, especially as Election Day approaches.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on a Pew study, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' has noted that polls of "likely voters" represent the "Holy Grail of polling" and are most likely to accurately reflect the outcome of an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clement|first1=Scott|title=Why the 'likely voter' is the holy grail of polling|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/07/why-the-likely-voter-is-the-holy-grail-of-polling/|accessdate=February 6, 2017|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of 2010 polling by [[Five Thirty Eight]] concluded that polls of "registered voters" that year tended to favor [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates by a factor of five percentage points over the actual results of the election, while polls of "likely voters" tended to favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates by a factor of one percentage point over the actual results of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Registered Voter Polls Will (Usually) Overrate Democrats|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voter-polls-will-usually-overrate-democrats/|accessdate=February 6, 2017|work=[[Five Thirty Eight]]|date=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' this is because registered voters who are least likely to actually cast a ballot tend to be low-income voters, or persons living in urban areas, which are constituencies that tend to favor Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Differences Between Registered And Likely Voter Polls Didn’t Affect Fall Trends In 2014 Senate Forecast|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/15/senate-polls_n_6327394.html|accessdate=December 15, 2014|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that registered voters tend to lean more to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] than to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], stating that "For those individuals identified as registered to vote by state governments, the voter file has a score (ranging from 0 to 100) describing their likelihood of voting for Democrats or Republicans, with higher numbers indicating a preference for Democrats. According to the full voter file, 55% of all registered voters in the U.S. are likely Democrats and 33% are likely Republicans." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/2018/10/09/the-rbs-poll-comports-well-with-data-from-the-full-voter-file-about-the-partisanship-of-registered-voters/|title=The RBS poll comports well with data from the full voter file about the partisanship of registered voters|last1=Kennedy|first1=Courtney|last2=Hatley|first2=Nick|last3=Keeter|first3=Scott|last4=Mercer|first4=Andrew|last5=Igeilnik|first5=Ruth|last6=Traylor|first6=Frederic|work=[[Pew Research Center]]|date=October 9, 2018|accessdate=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods for identifying "likely voters"==
Polls targeting "likely voters" generally begin with a list of known registered voters and then ask respondents a series of screening questions before the survey is conducted. Often this can simply be "are you going to vote on Election Day?" with respondents who answer "yes" to the question being included in the survey's final results, and those who answer "no" being excluded.&lt;ref name="gal2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newport|first1=Frank|title=How Do You Define "Likely Voters"?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/4636/how-define-likely-voters.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, complex formulas that account for a variety of demographic and psychographic variables are applied.&lt;ref name="gal2"/&gt;
