'''John Dadzie''', better known by his musical aliases '''12th Planet''' and '''Infiltrata''' is a [[Los Angeles]] based [[dubstep]] and [[drum and bass]] producer and DJ.

==Biography==
Born John Christopher Dadzie, he grew up in South Los Angeles, the youngest of four children.&lt;ref name="urb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/12th-planet-is-the-johnny-appleseed-of-dubstep-2174054 |title=12TH Planet is the Johnny Appleseed of Dubstep |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date = February 23, 2012|first = Liz|last = Ohanesian|website = laweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was first introduced to the electronic music scene in high school. After forming Imperial Recordings with DJ Lith, he launched his production skills on his own terms, originally producing [[drum and bass]] under the alias Infiltrata. In 2006, he decided that he was going to make [[dubstep]]. It was then that his new alias 12th Planet was created, in reference to [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s book, 12th Planet. All production under the name 12th Planet is original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thebigupmagazine.com/blog/about/music/12th-planet/ |title=12th Planet interview in Big magazine |publisher=thebigupmagazine.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314185607/http://thebigupmagazine.com/blog/about/music/12th-planet/ |archivedate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the first individuals to bring the dubstep culture to America (in one of the USA's electronic meccas, [[Los Angeles]]) 12th Planet has frequently been cited as the General of the Riddim Gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urb.com/2010/10/19/12-things-about-12th-planet-and-his-new-music-video-too/ |title=12 Things About 12th Planet (and his new music video too!) |publisher=URB |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803201159/http://www.urb.com/2010/10/19/12-things-about-12th-planet-and-his-new-music-video-too/ |archivedate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also collaborated with various dubstep producers including Datsik, Doctor P, [[Plastician]], [[Virtual Riot]] and [[Skream]].

By his teens, he became involved in local crime and in 2005 was incarcerated for eight months.&lt;ref name="DOC" /&gt; After this he became involved in music promotion and formed a group called Blood Money Union, which consisted of other DJs, producers and rappers.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

Saunders' first success in rapping had come with a self-released record called "Dirty Foot," which he wrote while still in high school&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; and distributed in the [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] area, at the urging of his cousin. After hearing it played in a local dance club and then witnessing another rapper's performance, 2 Pistols had his first chance to perform on-stage. After taking the stage and performing his own single ("Dirty Foot"), 2 Pistols' confidence in his abilities grew to a point that he began to take his chances at making a career of music seriously.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

His debut album, ''[[Death Before Dishonor (album)|Death Before Dishonor]]'', was released on June 17, 2008&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Listing at [http://www.billboard.com/artist/431860/2-pistols/chart Billboard.com], accessed October 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and featured production from the [[Grammy]]-winning [[J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]], Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E, Bolo Da Producer, and others. Other tracks from the album included "You Know Me feat. Ray J" &amp; "Thats My Word feat.Trey Songz"," in addition to "[[She Got It]]." The album peaked at #32 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, and rose to #10 on the Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop album chart.&lt;ref name="amcharts"&gt;{{cite web | title = Billboard Chart information at AllMusic.com | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1034303|pure_url=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 Pistols resides in [[Tampa, Florida]] and currently releases his music under his own label, Blood Money Union.

'''Selwyn Bougard''', now known as '''El-Divine Amir Bey''', better known by his stage name '''4th Disciple''', is a sonic artist and audio engineer who was one of the founding members of [[Killarmy]] and one of the best-known [[List of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates|Wu-Tang-affiliated producers]]. He is the only member of the Wu Elements to have worked on the Clan's first breakthrough album, as a mixer.

== Biography ==
After being a turntablist on the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', 4th Disciple co-produced and helped mix several tracks with the [[RZA]] on the first three Wu-Tang solo ventures by various artists, including co-production for "Sub Crazy" by [[Method Man]], "Damage" by [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] as well as mixing credits for some of [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'', on the tracks "Criminology," "Guillotine (Swordz)," "Spot Rusherz," and "Wu-Gambinos." 4th Disciple then produced what was at the time only the second Wu-Tang track ever to lack a RZA production credit, when the [[Killah Priest]] solo track "B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)" was included on [[GZA]]'s ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. This led to five 4th Disciple productions appearing on the double album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]''.

After producing 15 of the 17 tracks on Killarmy's debut album, ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]'', and contributing significant production to the debut albums of [[Killah Priest]] (''[[Heavy Mental]]'') and [[Sunz of Man]] (''[[The Last Shall Be First (Sunz of Man album)|The Last Shall be First]]''), 4th Disciple's beats continued to appear on the solo work of the Clan members, including Inspectah Deck and Method Man. However, more recently, 4th Disciple has been concentrating his production on Killarmy, Sunz of Man, and their immediate affiliates rather than the Clan itself. [[The RZA]] did, in fact, produce the tracks "Wake Up" and "War Face" from ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]''

[[Image:Alternation of generations simpler.svg|thumb|360px|Diagram showing the alternation of generations between a diploid sporophyte (bottom) and a haploid gametophyte (top)]]
'''Alternation of generations''' (also known as '''metagenesis''') is the type of [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] that occurs in those [[plant]]s and [[algae]] in the [[Archaeplastida]] and the [[Heterokontophyta]] that have distinct sexual haploid and asexual diploid stages.  In these groups, a multicellular [[gametophyte]], which is  [[haploid]] with ''n'' [[chromosome]]s, alternates with a multicellular [[sporophyte]], which is  [[diploid]] with 2''n'' chromosomes, made up of ''n'' pairs. A mature sporophyte produces [[spore]]s by [[meiosis]], a process which reduces the number of chromosomes to half, from 2''n'' to ''n''. 

The haploid spores germinate and grow into a haploid gametophyte. At maturity, the gametophyte produces [[gamete]]s by [[mitosis]], which does not alter the number of chromosomes. Two gametes (originating from different organisms of the same [[species]] or from the same organism) [[fertilisation|fuse]] to produce a [[zygote]], which develops into a diploid sporophyte.  This cycle, from gametophyte to gametophyte (or equally from sporophyte to sporophyte), is the way in which all land plants and many [[algae]] undergo [[sexual reproduction]].

The relationship between the sporophyte and gametophyte varies among different groups of plants. In those [[alga]]e which have alternation of generations, the sporophyte and gametophyte are separate independent organisms, which may or may not have a similar appearance. In [[liverwort]]s, [[moss]]es and [[hornwort]]s, the sporophyte is less well developed than the gametophyte and is largely dependent on it. Although moss and hornwort sporophytes can photosynthesise, they require additional photosynthate from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and depend on it for supply of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Thomas1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glime2007/&gt; By contrast, in all modern [[vascular plants]] the gametophyte is less well developed than the sporophyte, although their Devonian ancestors had gametophytes and sporophytes of approximately equivalent complexity.&lt;ref name=Kerp/&gt; In [[fern]]s the gametophyte is a small flattened [[autotrophic]] [[prothallium|prothallus]] on which the young sporophyte is briefly dependent for its nutrition. In [[flowering plant]]s, the reduction of the gametophyte is much more extreme; it consists of just a few cells which grow entirely inside the sporophyte.

Animals develop differently. They &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; produce haploid gametes. No haploid spores capable of dividing are produced, so they do not have a haploid gametophyte alternating with a diploid sporophyte. (Some insects have a [[Arrhenotoky|sex-determining system]] whereby haploid males are produced from unfertilized eggs; however the females are diploid.)

Life cycles of plants and algae with alternating haploid and diploid multicellular stages are referred to as '''diplohaplontic''' (the equivalent terms '''haplodiplontic''', '''diplobiontic''' or '''dibiontic''' are also in use). Life cycles, such as those of animals, in which there is only a diploid multicellular stage are referred to as '''diplontic'''. Life cycles in which there is only a haploid multicellular stage are referred to as '''haplontic'''.

==Definition==
Alternation of generations is defined as the alternation of multicellular diploid and haploid forms in the organism's life cycle, regardless of whether or not these forms are free-living.&lt;ref name="Taylor_2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|Kerp|Hass|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, such as the alga ''[[Ulva lactuca]]'', the diploid and haploid forms are indeed both free-living independent organisms, essentially identical in appearance and therefore said to be isomorphic. The free-swimming, haploid gametes form a diploid zygote which germinates into a multicellular diploid sporophyte.  The sporophyte produces free-swimming haploid spores by [[meiosis]] that germinate into haploid gametophytes.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web|url= http://www.plantscience4u.com/2014/05/diplohaplontic-life-cycle-in-algae.html#.V3vOW6s7o3R |title=Plant Science 4 U |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in some other groups, either the sporophyte or the gametophyte is very much reduced and is incapable of free living. For example, in all [[bryophytes]] the gametophyte generation is dominant and the sporophyte is dependent on it.  By contrast, in all modern [[vascular plants|vascular land plants]] the gametophytes  are strongly reduced, although the fossil evidence indicates that they were derived from isomorphic ancestors.&lt;ref name=Kerp/&gt; In [[seed plant]]s, the female gametophyte develops totally within the sporophyte which protects and nurtures it and the embryo sporophyte that it produces. The pollen grains, which are the male gametophytes, are reduced to only a few cells (just three cells in many cases). Here the notion of two generations is less obvious; as Bateman &amp; Dimichele say "[s]porophyte and gametophyte effectively function as a single organism".&lt;ref name="Bateman 1994 403"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|Dimichele|1994|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative term 'alternation of phases' may then be more appropriate.&lt;ref name="Stewart_Rothwell_1993"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Debates about alternation of generations in the early twentieth century can be confusing because various ways of classifying "generations" co-exist (sexual vs. asexual, gametophyte vs. sporophyte, haploid vs. diploid, etc.).&lt;ref name=Haig08&gt;{{Citation |last1=Haig |first1=David |date=2008 |title=Homologous versus antithetic alternation of generations and the origin of sporophytes |journal=The Botanical Review |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=395–418 |doi=10.1007/s12229-008-9012-x |url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11148775/Haig_HomologousVersus.pdf?sequence=3 |accessdate=2014-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, [[Chamisso]] and [[Japetus Steenstrup|Steenstrup]] described the succession of differently organized generations (sexual and asexual) in animals as "alternation of generations", while studying the development of [[tunicate]]s, [[cnidarian]]s and [[trematode]] animals.&lt;ref name=Haig08/&gt; This phenomenon is also known as [[heterogamy]]. Presently, the term "alternation of generations" is almost exclusively associated with the life cycles of plants, specifically with the alternation of haploid gametophytes and diploid sporophytes.&lt;ref name=Haig08/&gt;

[[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] demonstrated the morphological alternation of generations in plants,&lt;ref name=Sved27/&gt; between a spore-bearing generation (sporophyte) and a gamete-bearing generation (gametophyte).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hofmeister |first=W. |date=1851 |url=https://archive.org/details/vergleichendeun00hofmgoog |title=Vergleichende Untersuchungen der Keimung, Entfaltung und Fruchtbildildiung höherer Kryptogamen (Moose, Farne, Equisetaceen, Rhizocarpeen und Lycopodiaceen) und der Samenbildung der Coniferen |publication-place=Leipzig |publisher=F. Hofmeister |accessdate=2014-08-17 |language=German }}. Translated as {{citation |first=Frederick |last=Currey |date=1862 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/37864#/summary |title=On the germination, development, and fructification of the higher Cryptogamia, and on the fructification of the Coniferæ |publisher=Robert Hardwicke |publication-place=London |accessdate=2014-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Feldmann |first1=J. |authorlink1=Jean Feldmann |last2=Feldmann |first2=G. |year=1942 |title=Recherches sur les Bonnemaisoniacées et leur alternance de generations |journal=Ann.

[[Eduard Strasburger]] (1874) discovered the alternation between diploid and haploid nuclear phases,&lt;ref name=Haig08/&gt; also called cytological alternation of nuclear phases.&lt;ref name=Feld72&gt;{{Citation |last=Feldmann |first=J. |authorlink=Jean Feldmann |date=1972 |title=Les problèmes actuels de l'alternance de génerations chez les Algues |journal=Bulletin de la Société Botanique de France |volume=119 |pages=7–38 |doi=10.1080/00378941.1972.10839073 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00378941.1972.10839073 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most often coinciding, morphological alternation and nuclear phases alternation are sometimes independent of one another, e.g., in many [[red algae]], the same nuclear phase may correspond to two diverse morphological generations.&lt;ref name=Feld72/&gt; In some [[fern]]s which lost sexual reproduction, there is no change in nuclear phase, but the alternation of generations is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Schopfer, P. |author2=Mohr, H. | title = Plant physiology | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 1995 | pages = 288–291 | isbn = 3-540-58016-6 | chapter = Physiology of Development | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=jTxfMQg38B4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=mohr%20physiology&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA288#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternation of generations in plants==

===Fundamental elements===
The diagram above shows the fundamental elements of the alternation of generations in plants. The many variations found in different groups of plants are described by use of these concepts later in the article. Starting from the right of the diagram, the processes involved are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise indicated, the material in the whole of this section is based on {{Harvnb|Foster|Gifford|1974}}, {{Harvnb|Sporne|1974a}} and {{Harvnb|Sporne|1974b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Two single-celled haploid gametes, each containing ''n'' unpaired chromosomes, fuse to form a single-celled diploid zygote, which now contains ''n'' pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2''n'' chromosomes in total.
* The single-celled diploid zygote germinates, dividing by the normal process ([[mitosis]]), which maintains the number of chromosomes at 2''n''. The result is a multi-cellular diploid organism, called the ''sporophyte'' (because at maturity it produces spores).
* When it reaches maturity, the sporophyte produces one or more '''sporangia''' (singular: sporangium) which are the organs that produce diploid spore mother cells (sporocytes). These divide by a special process ([[meiosis]]) that reduces the number of chromosomes by a half. This initially results in four single-celled haploid spores, each containing ''n'' unpaired chromosomes.
* The single-celled haploid spore germinates, dividing by the normal process (mitosis), which maintains the number of chromosomes at ''n''. The result is a multi-cellular haploid organism, called the ''gametophyte'' (because it produces gametes at maturity).
* When it reaches maturity, the gametophyte produces one or more '''gametangia''' (singular: gametangium) which are the organs that produce haploid gametes. At least one kind of gamete possesses some mechanism for reaching another gamete in order to fuse with it.
The 'alternation of generations' in the life cycle is thus between a diploid (2''n'') generation of sporophytes and a haploid (''n'') generation of gametophytes.
[[Image:Onoclea sensibilis 4 crop.jpg|thumb|Gametophyte of the fern ''[[Onoclea sensibilis]]'' (the flat thallus at the bottom of the picture) with a descendant sporophyte beginning to grow from it (the small frond at the top of the picture).]]

The situation is quite different from that in animals, where the fundamental process is that a diploid (2''n'') individual &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; produces haploid (''n'') gametes by meiosis. Spores (i.e. haploid cells which are able to undergo mitosis) are not produced, so neither is an asexual multi-cellular generation that alternates with a sexual multi-cellular generation. (Some insects have haploid males that develop from unfertilized eggs, but the females are all diploid.)

===Variations===
The diagram shown above is a good representation of the life cycle of some multi-cellular algae (e.g. the genus ''[[Cladophora]]'') which have sporophytes and gametophytes of almost identical appearance and which do not have different kinds of spores or gametes.&lt;ref name="Guiry_Guiry_2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guiry|Guiry|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many possible variations on the fundamental elements of a life cycle which has alternation of generations. Each variation may occur separately or in combination, resulting in a bewildering variety of life cycles. The terms used by botanists in describing these life cycles can be equally bewildering. As Bateman and Dimichele say "[...] the alternation of generations has become a terminological morass; often, one term represents several concepts or one concept is represented by several terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|Dimichele|1994|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible variations are:
* ''Relative importance of the sporophyte and the gametophyte.''
** ''Equal'' ('''homomorphy''' or '''isomorphy''').&lt;br/&gt;Filamentous algae of the genus ''[[Cladophora]]'', which are predominantly found in fresh water, have diploid sporophytes and haploid gametophytes which are externally indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Shyam_1980"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shyam|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; No living land plant has equally dominant sporophytes and gametophytes, although some theories of the evolution of alternation of generations suggest that ancestral land plants did.
** ''Unequal'' ('''heteromorphy''' or '''anisomorphy''').[[Image:Mnium hornum 2005.04.02 14.55.41.jpg|thumb|Gametophyte of ''[[Mnium hornum]]'', a moss.]]
*** ''Dominant gametophyte'' ('''gametophytic''').&lt;br/&gt;In liverworts, mosses and hornworts, the dominant form is the haploid gametophyte. The diploid sporophyte is not capable of an independent existence, gaining most of its nutrition from the parent gametophyte, and having no chlorophyll when mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Blechnum discolor - crown fern.jpg|thumb|Sporophyte of ''[[Blechnum discolor]]'', a fern.]]
*** ''Dominant sporophyte'' ('''sporophytic''').&lt;br/&gt;In ferns, both the sporophyte and the gametophyte are capable of living independently, but the dominant form is the diploid sporophyte. The haploid gametophyte is much smaller and simpler in structure. In seed plants, the gametophyte is even more reduced (at the minimum to only three cells), gaining all its nutrition from the sporophyte. The extreme reduction in the size of the gametophyte and its retention within the sporophyte means that when applied to seed plants the term 'alternation of generations' is somewhat misleading: "[s]porophyte and gametophyte effectively function as a single organism".&lt;ref name="Bateman 1994 403"/&gt; Some authors have preferred the term 'alternation of phases'.&lt;ref name="Stewart_Rothwell_1993"/&gt;
* ''Differentiation of the gametes.''
** ''Both gametes the same'' ('''isogamy''').&lt;br/&gt;Like other species of ''[[Cladophora]]'', ''C. callicoma'' has flagellated gametes which are identical in appearance and ability to move.&lt;ref name="Shyam_1980" /&gt;
** ''Gametes of two distinct sizes'' ('''anisogamy''').
*** ''Both of similar motility''.&lt;br/&gt;Species of ''[[sea lettuce|Ulva]]'', the sea lettuce, have gametes which all have two flagella and so are motile. However they are of two sizes: larger 'female' gametes and smaller 'male' gametes.&lt;ref name="Kirby_2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kirby|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** ''One large and sessile, one small and motile'' ('''oogamy'''). The larger sessile megagametes are eggs (ova), and smaller motile microgametes are sperm (spermatozoa, spermatozoids). The degree of motility of the sperm may be very limited (as in the case of flowering plants) but all are able to move towards the sessile eggs. When (as is almost always the case) the sperm and eggs are produced in different kinds of gametangia, the sperm-producing ones are called '''antheridia''' (singular antheridium) and the egg-producing ones '''archegonia''' (singular archegonium).[[Image:Pellia epiphylla IMG 1610.jpg|thumb|Gametophyte of ''[[Pellia epiphylla]]'' with sporophytes growing from the remains of archegonia.]]
**** ''Antheridia and archegonia occur on the same gametophyte,'' which is then called '''[[monoicous]]'''. (Many sources, including those concerned with bryophytes, use the term 'monoecious' for this situation and 'dioecious' for the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1981|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bell|Hemsley|2000|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here 'monoecious' and 'dioecious' are used only for sporophytes.)&lt;br/&gt;The liverwort ''Pellia epiphylla'' has the gametophyte as the dominant generation. It is monoicous: the small reddish sperm-producing antheridia are scattered along the midrib while the egg-producing archegonia grow nearer the tips of divisions of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1981|pp=425–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**** ''Antheridia and archegonia occur on different gametophytes,'' which are then called '''dioicous'''.&lt;br/&gt;The moss ''Mnium hornum'' has the gametophyte as the dominant generation. It is dioicous: male plants produce only antheridia in terminal rosettes, female plants produce only archegonia in the form of stalked capsules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1981|pp=287–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed plant gametophytes are also dioicous. However, the parent sporophyte may be monoecious, producing both male and female gametophytes or dioecious, producing gametophytes of one gender only. Seed plant gametophytes are extremely reduced in size; the archegonium consists only of a small number of cells, and the entire male gametophyte may be represented by only two cells.{{sfn|Sporne|1974a|pp=17–21}}
* ''Differentiation of the spores.''
** ''All spores the same size'' ('''homospory''' or isospory).&lt;br/&gt;Horsetails (species of ''[[Equisetum]]'') have spores which are all of the same size.&lt;ref name="Bateman 1994 350–1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|Dimichele|1994|pp=350–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Spores of two distinct sizes'' ('''heterospory''' or anisospory): larger '''megaspores''' and smaller '''microspores'''. When the two kinds of spore are produced in different kinds of sporangia, these are called '''megasporangia''' and '''microsporangia'''. A megaspore often (but not always) develops at the expense of the other three cells resulting from meiosis, which abort.
*** ''Megasporangia and microsporangia occur on the same sporophyte,'' which is then called '''monoecious'''.&lt;br/&gt;Most flowering plants fall into this category. Thus the flower of a lily contains six stamens (the microsporangia) which produce microspores which develop into pollen grains (the microgametophytes), and three fused carpels which produce integumented megasporangia (ovules) each of which produces a megaspore which develops inside the megasporangium to produce the megagametophyte. In other plants, such as hazel, some flowers have only stamens, others only carpels, but the same plant (i.e. sporophyte) has both kinds of flower and so is monoecious.[[Image:Hollyflowers.jpg|right|thumb|Flowers of European Holly, a dioecious species: male above, female below (leaves cut to show flowers more clearly)]]
*** ''Megasporangia and microsporangia occur on different sporophytes,'' which are then called '''dioecious'''.&lt;br/&gt;An individual tree of the European holly (''[[Ilex aquifolium]]'') produces either 'male' flowers which have only functional stamens (microsporangia) producing microspores which develop into pollen grains (microgametophytes) or 'female' flowers which have only functional carpels producing integumented megasporangia (ovules) that contain a megaspore that develops into a multicellular megagametophyte.

There are some correlations between these variations, but they are just that, correlations, and not absolute. For example, in flowering plants, microspores ultimately produce microgametes (sperm) and megaspores ultimately produce megagametes (eggs). However, in ferns and their allies there are groups with undifferentiated spores but differentiated gametophytes. For example, the fern ''[[Ceratopteris]] thalictrioides'' has spores of only one kind, which vary continuously in size. Smaller spores tend to germinate into gametophytes which produce only sperm-producing antheridia.&lt;ref name="Bateman 1994 350–1"/&gt;

===A complex life cycle===
[[Image:Alternation of generations complex.svg|500px|thumb|right|Graphic referred in text.]]
The diagram shows the alternation of generations in a species which is heteromorphic, sporophytic, oogametic, dioicous, heterosporic and dioecious. A seed plant example might be a [[willow]] tree (most species of the genus ''Salix'' are dioecious).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=1911 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=11th |publication-place=New York |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=XIX |contribution=Willows  |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_28.djvu/708 |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the centre of the diagram, the processes involved are:
* An immobile egg, contained in the archegonium, fuses with a mobile sperm, released from an antheridium. The resulting zygote is either ''''male'''' or ''''female''''.
** A ''''male'''' zygote develops by mitosis into a microsporophyte, which at maturity produces one or more microsporangia. Microspores develop within the microsporangium by meiosis.&lt;br/&gt;In a willow (like all seed plants) the zygote first develops into an embryo microsporophyte within the ovule (a megasporangium enclosed in one or more protective layers of tissue known as integument). At maturity, these structures become the [[seed]]. Later the seed is shed, germinates and grows into a mature tree. A 'male' willow tree (a microsporophyte) produces flowers with only stamens, the anthers of which are the microsporangia.
** Microspores germinate producing microgametophytes; at maturity one or more antheridia are produced. Sperm develop within the antheridia.&lt;br/&gt;In a willow,  microspores are not liberated from the anther (the microsporangium), but develop into pollen grains (microgametophytes) within it. The whole pollen grain is moved (e.g. by an insect or by the wind) to an ovule (megagametophyte), where a sperm is produced which moves down a pollen tube to reach the egg.
** A ''''female'''' zygote develops by mitosis into a megasporophyte, which at maturity produces one or more megasporangia. Megaspores develop within the megasporangium; typically one of the four spores produced by meiosis gains bulk at the expense of the remaining three, which disappear.&lt;br/&gt;'Female' willow trees (megasporophytes) produce flowers with only carpels (modified leaves that bear the megasporangia).
** Megaspores germinate producing megagametophytes; at maturity one or more archegonia are produced. Eggs develop within the archegonia.&lt;br/&gt; The carpels of a willow produce ovules, megasporangia enclosed in integuments. Within each ovule, a megaspore develops by mitosis into a megagametophyte. An archegonium develops within the megagametophyte and produces an egg. The whole of the gametophytic 'generation' remains within the protection of the sporophyte except for pollen grains (which have been reduced to just three cells contained within the microspore wall).{{clear}}

==Life cycles of different plant groups==
The term "plants" is taken here to mean the [[Archaeplastida]], i.e. the [[glaucophyte]]s, [[red algae|red]] and [[green algae]] and [[land plants]].

Alternation of generations occurs in almost all multicellular red and green algae, both freshwater forms (such as ''[[Cladophora]]'') and seaweeds (such as ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''). In most, the generations are homomorphic (isomorphic) and free-living. Some species of red algae have a complex triphasic alternation of generations, in which there is a gametophyte phase and two distinct sporophyte phases. For further information, see [[Red algae#Reproduction|Red algae: Reproduction]].

Land plants all have heteromorphic (anisomorphic) alternation of generations, in which the sporophyte and gametophyte are distinctly different. All [[bryophyte]]s, i.e. [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, [[moss]]es and [[hornwort]]s, have the gametophyte generation as the most conspicuous. As an illustration, consider a monoicous moss. Antheridia and archegonia develop on the mature plant (the gametophyte). In the presence of water, the biflagellate sperm from the antheridia swim to the archegonia and fertilisation occurs, leading to the production of a diploid sporophyte. The sporophyte grows up from the archegonium. Its body comprises a long stalk topped by a capsule within which spore-producing cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. Most mosses rely on the wind to disperse these spores, although ''[[Splachnum sphaericum]]'' is [[entomophilous]], recruiting  insects to disperse its spores. For further information, see [[Marchantiophyta#Life cycle|Liverwort: Life cycle]], [[Moss#Life cycle|Moss: Life cycle]], [[Hornwort#Life cycle|Hornwort: Life cycle]].

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Lifecycle moss svg diagram.svg|Moss life cycle diagram
Image:Hornwort life cicle svg diagram.svg|Hornwort life cycle diagram
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[fern]]s and their allies, including [[clubmoss]]es and [[horsetail]]s, the conspicuous plant observed in the field is the diploid sporophyte. The haploid spores develop in [[sorus|sori]] on the underside of the fronds and are dispersed by the wind (or in some cases, by floating on water). If conditions are right, a spore will germinate and grow into a rather inconspicuous plant body called a [[prothallus]]. The haploid prothallus does not resemble the sporophyte, and as such ferns and their allies have a heteromorphic alternation of generations. The prothallus is short-lived, but carries out sexual reproduction, producing the diploid [[zygote]] that then grows out of the prothallus as the sporophyte. For further information, see [[Fern#Life cycle|Fern: Life cycle]].

Image:SoriDicksonia.jpg|&lt;center&gt;The underside of a ''Dicksonia antarctica'' frond showing the sori, or spore-producing structures.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the [[spermatophyte]]s, the seed plants, the sporophyte is the dominant multicellular phase; the gametophytes are strongly reduced in size and very different in morphology. The entire gametophyte generation, with the sole exception of pollen grains (microgametophytes), is contained within the sporophyte. The life cycle of a dioecious flowering plant (angiosperm), the willow, has been outlined in some detail in an earlier section ([[#A complex life cycle|A complex life cycle]]). The life cycle of a [[gymnosperm]] is similar. However, flowering plants have in addition a phenomenon called '[[double fertilization]]'. Two sperm nuclei from a pollen grain (the microgametophyte), rather than a single sperm, enter the archegonium of the megagametophyte; one fuses with the egg nucleus to form the zygote, the other fuses with two other nuclei of the gametophyte to form '[[endosperm]]', which nourishes the developing embryo. For further information, see [[Double fertilization]].

==Evolutionary emergence of the dominant diploid phase==
It has been proposed that the basis for the emergence of the diploid phase of the life cycle (sporophyte) as the dominant phase (e.g. as in vascular plants) is that diploidy allows masking of the expression of deleterious mutations through [[Complementation (genetics)|genetic complementation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bernstein |first1=H. |last2=Byers |first2=G.S. |last3=Michod |first3=R.E. |year=1981 |title=Evolution of sexual reproduction: Importance of DNA repair, complementation, and variation |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=537–549 |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1086/283734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Michod |first1=R.E. |last2=Gayley |first2=T.W. |year=1992 |title=Masking of mutations and the evolution of sex |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=139 |issue=4 |pages=706–734 |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1086/285354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if one of the parental genomes in the diploid cells contained [[mutation]]s leading to defects in one or more [[gene product]]s, these deficiencies could be compensated for by the other parental genome (which nevertheless may have its own defects in other genes).  As the diploid phase was becoming predominant, the masking effect likely allowed [[genome size]], and hence information content, to increase without the constraint of having to improve accuracy of DNA replication.  The opportunity to increase information content at low cost was advantageous because it permitted new adaptations to be encoded. This view has been challenged, with evidence showing that selection is no more effective in the haploid than in the diploid phases of the lifecycle of mosses and angiosperms.&lt;ref name="SzövRiccHockShaw13"&gt;{{Citation |last=Szövényi |first=Péter |last2=Ricca |first2=Mariana |last3=Hock |first3=Zsófia |last4=Shaw |first4=Jonathan A. |last5=Shimizu |first5=Kentaro K. |last6=Wagner |first6=Andreas |year=2013 |title=Selection is no more efficient in haploid than in diploid life stages of an angiosperm and a moss |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1929 |doi=10.1093/molbev/mst095 |lastauthoramp=yes |pmid=23686659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar processes in other organisms==

=== Rhizaria ===
Some organisms currently classified in the clade [[Rhizaria]] and thus not plants in the sense used here, exhibit alternation of generations.  [[Foraminifera]] undergo a heteromorphic alternation of generations between haploid '''''gamont''''' and diploid '''''agamont''''' forms. The single-celled haploid organism is typically much larger than the diploid organism.

=== Fungi ===
Fungal [[mycelia]] are typically haploid. When mycelia of different mating types meet, they produce two [[multinucleate]] ball-shaped cells, which join via a "mating bridge". Nuclei move from one mycelium into the other, forming a '''''[[heterokaryon]]''''' (meaning "different nuclei"). This process is called '''''[[plasmogamy]]'''''. Actual fusion to form [[diploid]] nuclei is called '''''[[karyogamy]]''''', and may not occur until [[sporangia]] are formed. Karogamy produces a diploid zygote, which is a short-lived sporophyte that soon undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. When the spores germinate, they develop into new mycelia.

=== Slime moulds ===
The life cycle of [[slime mould]]s is very similar to that of fungi. Haploid spores germinate to form swarm cells or '''''myxamoebae'''''.  These fuse in a process referred to as ''plasmogamy'' and ''karyogamy'' to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into a plasmodium, and the mature plasmodium produces, depending on the species, one to many fruiting bodies containing haploid spores.

=== Animals ===
Alternation between a multicellular diploid and a multicellular haploid generation is never encountered in animals.&lt;ref name=Barnes2001&gt;{{Harvnb|Barnes|Calow|Olive|Golding|2001|p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some animals, there is an alternation between [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenic]] and [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproductive]] phases ([[heterogamy]]).  Both phases are diploid. This has sometimes been called "alternation of generations",&lt;ref name=Scott1996&gt;{{Harvnb|Scott|1996|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is quite different. In some other animals, such as [[hymenoptera]]ns, males are haploid and females diploid, but this is always the case rather than there being an alternation between distinct generations.

'''Apparent death''', colloquially known as '''playing dead''', '''feigning death''', or '''playing possum''', is a behavior in which animals take on the appearance of being [[death|dead]].  This form of [[Deception in animals|animal deception]] is an [[adaptive behavior]] also known as '''tonic immobility''' or '''thanatosis'''.  Apparent death can be used as a [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]] or as a form of [[aggressive mimicry]], and occurs in a wide range of animals.

When induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as '''animal hypnosis'''.  According to Gilman et al.,&lt;ref name="Gilman et al., 1950"&gt;Gilman, T.T., Marcuse, F.L. and Moore, A.U., (1960). Animal hypnosis: a study of the induction of tonic immobility in chickens. Journal of Comparative Physiology and Psychology, 43: 99-111&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation of "animal hypnosis" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by [[Athanasius Kircher]].

Tonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily [[paralysed]] and unresponsive to external stimuli.  In most cases, this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator, although in [[sharks]] exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"&gt;Henningsen, A.D., (1994).  Tonic immobility in 12 elasmobranchs - use as an aid in captive husbandry. Zoo Biology 13: 325-332. {{doi|10.1002/zoo.1430130406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility.&lt;ref name="Jones 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones, R.B|title=The tonic immobility reaction of the domestic fowl: a review|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=42|issue=1|year=1986|pages=82–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities.

===In sharks===
Some sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. [[dogfish sharks]], [[lemon shark]]s, [[whitetip reef shark]]s.&lt;ref name="Henningsen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watsky, M.A., and Gruber, S.H. (1990) Induction and duration of tonic immobility in the lemon shark, ''Negaprion brevirostris''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 8: 207-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davie, P.S., Franklin, C.E., and Grigg, G.C. (1993) Blood pressure and heart rate during tonic immobility in the black tipped reef shark, ''Carcharhinus melanoptera''. Fish Physiology and Biochemistry 12: 95-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[tiger shark]]s (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour.  Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical [[shark repellent]] has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tonic immobility|website=Shark defense: Chemical repellents|url=http://www.sharkdefense.com/Repellents/Tonic_Immobility/tonic_immobility.html|accessdate=January 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks.&lt;ref&gt;Heithaus, M.R., Dill, L.M., Marshall, G.J., and Buhleier, B. (2002) Habitat use and foraging behavior of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in a seagrass ecosystem. Marine Biology 140: 237-248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, K.N., Wetherbee, B.M., owe, C.G., and Meyer, C.G. (1999) Movements of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in coastal Hawaiian waters. Marine Biology 134: 665-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, E. J., et al. "The Stress Physiology of Extended Duration Tonic Immobility in the Juvenile Lemon Shark, Negaprion Brevirostris (Poey 1868)." Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology 409.1-2 (2011): 351-60. SCOPUS. Web. 22 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lauren Smith|title=Orcas vs great white sharks: in a battle of the apex predators who wins?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/nov/16/orca-whales-vs-great-white-sharks-in-a-battle-of-the-apex-predators-who-wins|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In teleost fishes===
[[Goldfish]], [[trout]], [[rudd]], [[tench]], [[brown bullhead]], [[medaka]], [[paradise fish]], and [[topminnow]] have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;Table 2 in: Whitman, P.A., Marshall, J.A., and Keller, E.C.Jr. (1986) Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae). Copeia 1986: 829-832.&lt;/ref&gt; [[oscar (fish)|Oscars]] seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F.T. (1977) Induction and duration of tonic immobility. The Psychological Record 27: 89-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar behavior has been reported for [[convict tang]]s in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, J.C. (1991) Field observations of death feigning in the convict tang, ''Acanthurus triostegus'' (Linnaeus), with comments on the nocturnal color pattern in juvenile specimens. Journal of Aquariculture and Aquatic Sciences 6: 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In marine mammals===
In 1997, it was reported that around the [[Farallon Islands]] off the coast of [[California]], a female [[orca]] was seen apparently inducing tonic immobility in a [[great white shark]]. The orca held the shark upside down to induce TI and kept the shark still for 15 minutes, causing it to suffocate to death.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This was the first recorded case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans.

Another case of orcas apparently inducing TI has been observed with [[stingrays]] in [[New Zealand]]. In this context, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths then quickly right themselves.  This inverts the stingray, thereby inducing TI, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Channel "The Whale That Ate Jaws" 11/29/2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===In reptiles===
Tonic immobility can be reliably induced in [[iguana]]s by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular.  The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity.&lt;ref name="Prestrude"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Prestrude, A.M.  |author2=Crawford, F.T.|title=Tonic immobility in the lizard, iguana iguana|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=18|issue=2|year=1970|pages=391–395|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(70)80052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonic immobility can also be induced in the [[Carolina anole]].  The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity.&lt;ref name="Hennig"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tonic immobility in Anolis carolinensis: Effects of time and conditions of captivity|year=1978|journal=Behavioral Biology|author1=Hennig, C.W  |author2=Dunlap, W.P.|volume=23|issue=1|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/s0091-6773(78)91180-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In rabbits===
In [[rabbit]]s, the physiological and behavioral responses to induced tonic immobility have been found to be indicative of a fear-motivated stress state. Tonic immobility is considered a last attempt for prey to escape being eaten by a predator. A 2006 study concluded that rabbits show symptoms that are in line with being stressed after being in a tonic immobility state, such as a faster heart rate and breathing.&lt;ref name="McBride et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Anne |year=2006 |title=Trancing rabbits: Relaxed hypnosis or a state of fear? |journal=Proceedings of the VDWE International Congress on Companion Animal Behaviour and Welfare |volume= |issue= |pages=135–137 |doi= |url= http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/54860 |accessdate=September 2, 2013|display-authors=etal}} (downloadable .doc file). • Click [http://www.hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf here] for PDF copy from hopperhome.com.&lt;/ref&gt; This confirms that the promotion of tonic immobility to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners – holding the rabbit on its back and thinking the rabbits enjoy it – is misplaced; however, the researchers concluded that inducing tonic immobility in rabbits is appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.&lt;ref name="McBride et al." /&gt;

===In humans===
Tonic immobility has been hypothesized to occur in humans undergoing intense trauma, including sexual assault. While "freezing" in response to life-threatening situations is well-known, the common "freeze" response exhibited by victims of rape is often misunderstood as passive consent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/proceedings/20/galliano.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/06/23/why-many-rape-victims-dont-fight-or-yell/ Why many rape victims don’t fight or yell]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

There is also an increasing body of evidence that points to a positive contribution of tonic immobility in human functioning.

===As a scientific tool===
Tonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation.  It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970.&lt;ref name="Gallup et al., 1970"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., Nash, R.F., Potter, R.J. and Donegan, N.H., (1970). Effect of varying conditions of fear on immobility reactions in domestic chickens (Gallus gullus).  Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 73: 442-445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallup, 1979"&gt;Gallup, G.G., Jr., (1979).  Tonic immobility as a measure of fear in the domestic fowl.  Animal Behaviour, 27: 316-317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"&gt;Jones, B. and Faure, J.M. (1981). Tonic immobility ("righting time") in laying hens housed in cages and pens. Applied Animal Ethology 7: 369-372&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the TI test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting the anti-predator response. The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death-feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; TI in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.&lt;ref name="Forkman et al., 2007"&gt;Forkman, B., Boissy, A. Meunier-Salaün, M.-C. Canali, E. and Jones, R.B., (2007). A critical review of fear tests used on cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry and horses.  Physiology &amp; Behavior, 92: 340-374&lt;/ref&gt;

To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds.  This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck.&lt;ref name="Zamudio et al., 2009"&gt;Zamudio, S.R., Quevedo-Corona, L., Garcés, L. and De La Cruz, F. (2009).  The effects of acute stress and acute corticosterone administration on the immobility response in rats.  Brain Research Bulletin, 80: 331-336&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’.

Tonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens,&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, 1981"/&gt; hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels,&lt;ref name="Jones, 1987"&gt;Jones, R.B., (1987).

Fear levels in laying hens carried by hand and by mechanical conveyors. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 36: 337-345&lt;/ref&gt; and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration.&lt;ref name="Cashman et al., 1989"&gt;Cashman P., Nicol, C.J. and Jones, R.B. (1989).  Effects of transportation on the tonic immobility fear reactions of broilers. British Poultry Science, 30: 211-221&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonic immobility as a scientific tool has also been used with [[mice]],&lt;ref name="Bazovkina et al., 2011"&gt;Bazovkina D.V., Tibeikina M.A., Kulikov A.V. and  Popova, N.K., (2011).

In [[ethology|animal behaviour]], thanatosis (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|θανάτωσις}}, meaning "putting to death"; ''[[cf. ]]'': [[Thanatos]]) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a [[prey]] evading a [[predator]], a male trying to [[mating|mate]] with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The [[French people|French]] biologist [[Georges Pasteur]] classifies it as a form of ''self-mimesis'', a form of [[camouflage]] or [[mimicry]] in which the "mimic" imitates itself in a dead state.&lt;ref name=Pasteur /&gt;

===For defense===
For defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;Pasteur, G. (1982). "[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 A classificatory review of mimicry systems]". ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''13''': 169–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced,&lt;ref name="beetle"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Miyatake|first1 = T|last2 = Katayama|first2 = K.|last3 = Takeda|first3 = Y.|last4 = Nakashima|first4 = A.|last5 = Mizumoto|first5 = M.|year = 2004|title = Is death-feigning adaptive?

In the [[Hognose|hog-nosed snake]], a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul-smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as [[cat]]s, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when [[rat]]s try to eat them.&lt;ref&gt;''Triumph of Life'' (2006). Alexandria, VA: PBS Home Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, the [[Virginia opossum]] is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. "[[wikt:play possum|Playing possum]]" is an idiomatic phrase which means "pretending to be dead".&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book|title =The Chambers Dictionary|publisher =Allied Publishers|year =1998|page=1279|isbn =978-81-86062-25-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Francq|first = E.|year = 1969|title = Behavioural aspects of feigned death in the opossum ''Didelphis marsupialis''|journal = American Midland Naturalist|volume = 81|pages = 556–568|doi = 10.2307/2423988|issue = 2|jstor = 2423988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |title=Playing Possum |publisher=Wonderful West Virginia |author=Ann Bailey Dunn |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001110406/http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[instinct]] does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging [[roadkill]] may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/wildlife/index.php?subject=Mammals&amp;id=71|title=Virginia Opossum|publisher=Mass Audubon|accessdate=May 11, 2011|quote=Opossums are frequently encountered as corpses along highways. Some biologists believe that many die as they feed on road-killed animals – a favorite food. Others believe that the opossums’ small brain (5 times smaller than that of a raccoon) suggests that they may just be too dumb to get out of the way of vehicles!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a [[brown bear]] is to lie face down, cover the face with ones hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/stories/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack&lt;/ref&gt;

"Playing possum" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], [[asleep]], or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself.&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt;

Thanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp ''[[Nasonia vitripennis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = King|first = B.|author2=H. Leaich |year = 2006|title = Variation in propensity to exhibit thanatosis in ''Nasonia vitripennis'' (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)|journal = Journal of Insect Behaviour|volume = 19|issue = 2|pages = 241–249|doi = 10.1007/s10905-006-9022-7|citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.3100}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cricket, ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Nishino|first = H.|year = 2004|title = Motor output characterizing thanatosis in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus|journal = Journal of Experimental Behaviour|volume =207|issue = 22|pages = 3899–3915|doi=10.1242/jeb.01220|pmid = 15472021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For reproduction===
In the spider species ''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'', male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of [[Nuptial gift (animal behavior)|gift-giving]] and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.&lt;ref name="spider"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Line Spinner Hansen |author2=Sofia Fernandez Gonzales |author3=Søren Toft |author4=Trine Bilde |year=2008|title=Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider ''Pisaura mirabilis''|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=19 |issue=3|pages=546–551|doi=10.1093/beheco/arm165|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/546.full|accessdate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For predation===
''[[Nimbochromis]]'' (sleeper cichlids), [[endemic]] to [[Lake Malawi]] in [[East Africa]], are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. ''N. livingstoni'' then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close.&lt;ref name="fish"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gene S. Helfman |author2=Bruce B. Collette |author3=Douglas E. Facey |title =The diversity of fishes|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell|year =1997|page=324|isbn =978-0-86542-256-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKaye, K.R. (1981) Field observation on death feigning: a unique hunting behavior by the predatory cichlid, ''Haplochromis livingstonii'', of Lake Malawi. Environmental Biology of Fishes 6: 361-365.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar strategy has also been observed in the African cichlid ''[[Lamprologus lemairii]]'' from [[Lake Tanganyika]] &lt;ref&gt;Lucanus, O. (1998) Darwin’s pond: Malawi and Tanganyika. Tropical Fish Hobbyist 47: 150-154.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Central American yellowjacket cichlid ''[[Parachromis friedrichsthalii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tobler, M.

==Early life and education==
De Grey was born and brought up in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/06/14/372618/index.htm |title=This Man Would Have You Live A Really, Really, Really, Really Long Time.

[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/healthandwellbeing.genetics Holding back the years], ''The Observer'', 16 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at [[Sussex House School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sussexhouseschool.co.uk/main_pages/aboutUs.html |title=About Us |publisher=[[Sussex House School]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009191353/http://www.sussexhouseschool.co.uk/main_pages/aboutUs.html |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harrow School]]. He attended the [[University of Cambridge]], and studied at its constituent college of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]]. He graduated with a BA in computer science in 1985.&lt;ref name=executive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sens.org/about/leadership/executive-team|title=Executive Team|work=sens.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduation in 1985, de Grey joined [[Sinclair Research Ltd]] as an [[artificial intelligence]] and software engineer. In 1986, he cofounded Man-Made Minions Ltd to pursue the development of an automated [[formal verification|formal program verifier]]. At a graduate party in Cambridge, De Grey met [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] geneticist [[Adelaide Carpenter]] whom he would later marry. Through her he was introduced to the intersection of biology and programming when her boss needed someone who knew about computers and biology to take over the running of a database on fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mprize.org/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=044 Aubrey de Grey], Methuselah Foundation, accessed 9 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He educated himself in biology by reading journals and textbooks, attending conferences, and being tutored by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/healthandwellbeing.genetics|title=Tom Templeton on biomedical theorist Aubrey de Grey|author=Tom Templeton|work=the Guardian|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-01/prophet-immortality|title=The Prophet of Immortality|work=Popular Science|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 to 2006, he was in charge of software development at the university's Genetics Department for the [[FlyBase]] [[genetics|genetic]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Cambridge awarded de Grey a PhD in biology on 9 December 2000.&lt;ref name=executive/&gt;&lt;ref name=camreporter&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2000-01/weekly/5831/27.html Congregation of the Regent House on 9 December 2000], [[Cambridge University Reporter]], 13 December 2000.  [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/gradstud/exams/higher/special.pdf Special regulations] available only to Cambridge degree holders (of whatever discipline) permit the submission of  "...a significant contribution to scholarship" instead. Though the awardee has not been registered as a PhD student, the degree is not honorary; applicants are evaluated by the usual methods, with examiners appointed and an oral defense of the submitted work.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree was based on his 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'', in which de Grey wrote that obviating damage to mitochondrial DNA might by itself extend lifespan significantly, though he said it was more likely that cumulative damage to [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] is a significant cause of senescence, but not the single dominant cause.

===Strategies===
De Grey argues that most of the fundamental knowledge needed to develop effective anti-aging medicine already exists, and that the science is ahead of the funding. He works to identify and promote specific technological approaches to the reversal of various aspects of aging, or, as de Grey puts it, "... the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us."&lt;ref name="050411_aubrey_interview.html"/&gt;

{{As of|2005}}, his work centered on a detailed plan called Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which is aimed at preventing age-related physical and cognitive decline. In March 2009, he cofounded the [[SENS Research Foundation]] (named SENS Foundation until early 2013), a non-profit organisation based in California, United States, where he currently serves as Chief Science Officer. The Foundation "works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to regenerative medicine solutions to the disabilities and diseases of aging,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sens.org/sens-foundation/brief-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222223643/http://www.sens.org/sens-foundation/brief-history|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence. Before March 2009, the SENS research program was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], cofounded by de Grey.

A major activity of the Methuselah Foundation is the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mprize.org|title=Methuselah Foundation|work=mprize.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prize designed to incentivize research into effective life extension interventions by awarding monetary prizes to researchers who stretch the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths. De Grey stated in March 2005 "if we are to bring about real regenerative therapies that will benefit not just future generations, but those of us who are alive today, we must encourage scientists to work on the problem of aging." The prize reached 4.2 [[United States dollar|USD]] million in February 2007.

In 2005, he was the subject of two highly critical editorials accompanying an article in ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''.&lt;ref name=NulandFebr2005&gt;Nuland, Sherwin. February 2005. "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/14147/ Do You Want to Live Forever?]" ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, de Grey wrote the book ''[[Ending Aging]]'' with the assistance of Michael Rae.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael. September 2007. ''[[Ending Aging]]: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime''. New York, NY: Saint Martin's Press, 416 p. {{ISBN|0-312-36706-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a detailed account of the science, politics and social challenges of the entire SENS agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= [[Ben Best]] |title= Book Review: Ending Aging |work= Life Extension Magazine |publisher= [[Life Extension Foundation]] |date=December 2007 |url= http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2007/dec2007_bookreview_01.htm |accessdate= 12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 broadcast on the [[Arte]] German &amp; French TV, de Grey claimed that the first human to live 1,000 years was probably already alive, and might even be between 50 and 60 years old already.&lt;ref&gt;''Aux frontières de l'immortalité'', 16 November 2008, 23:10, director  : Gerald Caillat&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, soon after he began speaking publicly about his gerontological theories, de Grey has been scientific advisor for the Campaign for Aging Research (C.A.R.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/07/longevity-meme-newsletter-july-20-2009.php|title=Longevity Meme Newsletter, July 20 2009|work=Fight Aging!|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2013}}, the SENS Research Foundation has an annual budget of $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sens.org/about/organizational-reports|title=Organizational Reports|work=sens.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-aging trance===
[[File:SENS FOUNDATION - AUBREY DE GREY (6838320854).jpg|alt=de Grey smiling|thumb|de Grey, 2012]]
The "pro-aging trance" is a term coined by Grey to describe "the impulsion to leap to embarrassingly unjustified conclusions in order to put the horror of aging out of one's mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= de Grey |first= Aubrey |title= Combating the Tithonus Error: What Works? |journal= [[Rejuvenation Research]] |volume= 11 |issue= 4 |pages= 713–715 |date= August 2008 |doi= 10.1089/rej.2008.0775 |pmid= 18729803}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to de Grey, the pro-aging trance or "pro-aging edifice"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= de Grey |first= Aubrey |title= Cracks in Social Gerontology's Pro-Aging Edifice |journal= [[Rejuvenation Research]] |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–2 |date= February 2009 |doi= 10.1089/rej.2009.0841 |pmid= 19236163}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a psychological strategy which people use to cope with aging, and which is rooted in the belief that aging is not only immutable and unavoidable, but ''desirable'' in some sense, as part of the natural or divine order that should not be perturbed. De Grey refers, in this regard, to the general public's ambivalence towards aging. For example, he states that [[SENS Research Foundation|SENS]] research is often misunderstood or misrepresented as likely to lead to ''prolonging'', rather than postponing, the period of decrepitude characteristic of old age—a belief that de Grey calls the "Tithonus error", in reference to the myth of [[Tithonus]]. He describes this "pro-aging" stance as an irrational response&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2CR7NeLumI}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the perceived inevitability of aging, and compares it with related ideas and experimental findings in [[terror management theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyszczynski|first1=T|last2=Greenberg|first2=J|title=Understanding the paradox of opposition to long-term extension of the human lifespan: fear of feath, cultural worldviews, and the illusion of objectivity|journal=Rejuvenation Research|date=September 2013|volume=16|issue=S1|pages=S36-7|ref=Pyszczynski2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, de Grey believes that defeating aging is feasible and that the pro-aging trance represents a huge barrier to combating aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging|title=Aubrey de Grey: A roadmap to end aging - Talk Video - TED.com|author=Aubrey de Grey|work=ted.com|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding of SENS Research Foundation===
In 2011, de Grey inherited roughly $16.5 million on the death of his mother.&lt;ref name="lef.org"&gt;Ben Best (2013) [http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2013/jul2013_Interview-with-Aubrey-de-Grey-PhD_01.htm "Interview with Aubrey de Grey, PhD"]. Life Extension Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this he assigned $13 million to fund SENS research, which by 2013 had the effect of roughly doubling the SENS Research Foundation's yearly budget to $4 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Other donors who have given millions to the Foundation include investor [[Peter Thiel]].&lt;ref name="lef.org"/&gt; The foundation also has yearly funding drives that have been successful with some significant donors offering matching grants for members of the public who donate.&lt;ref name=SRFnews201502&gt;{{cite news|last1=SENS Research Foundation|title=February 2015 Newsletter|url=http://www.sens.org/sites/srf.org/files/newsletter-archive/February%202015%20NL.html|accessdate=24 February 2015|work=SENS Research Foundation Newsletter|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FA!20141215&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reason|title=SENS Fundraiser Success!|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2014/12/sens-fundraiser-success.php|publisher=Fight Aging!|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AgeX Therapeutics, Inc.===
In July 2017 de Grey was appointed Vice President of New Technology Discovery at [[BioTime#Subsidiaries|AgeX Therapeutics]], a startup in the Longevity space helmed by [[Michael D. West]], PhD.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name = NextBigFuture/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= AgeX Therapeutics lands $10 mln|url=https://www.pehub.com/2017/08/agex-therapeutics-lands-10-mln/ |work= PE HUB |date= August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The seven types of aging damage===
{{Main article|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence}}
De Grey proposed the following types of aging damage:
#Mutations – in chromosomes causing cancer due to nuclear mutations/epimutations:
#:These are changes to the nuclear [[DNA]] (nDNA), the molecule that contains genetic information in [[eukaryote]]s, or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain [[mutation]]s can lead to cancer, and, according to de Grey, non-cancerous mutations and [[Epigenetics|epimutations]] do not contribute to aging within a normal lifespan, so cancer is the only endpoint of these types of damage that must be addressed.
#Mutations – in mitochondria:
#:[[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are components in eukaryotic [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for energy production. They contain their own genetic material, and mutations to their DNA can affect a cell's ability to function properly. Indirectly, these mutations may accelerate many aspects of aging.
#Junk – inside of cells, aka intracellular aggregates:
#:Cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can't be digested simply accumulate as junk inside of cells. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]] and many kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as Alzheimer's) are associated with this problem.
#Junk – outside of cells, aka extracellular aggregates:
#:Harmful junk protein can also accumulate outside of cells. The amyloid [[senile plaque]] seen in the brains of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] patients is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PTN interviews Dr. Aubrey de Grey, researcher of anti-aging regenerative medicine|
url=http://www.planettechnews.com/interviews/ptn-interviews-dr-aubrey-de-grey-researcher-and-a-thought-leader-in-anti-aging-regenerative-medicine|publisher=[[PlanetTech]] News|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Cells – too few, aka cellular loss:
#:Some of the cells in bodies cannot be replaced, or can be replaced only very slowly – more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number causes the heart to become weaker with age, causes [[Parkinson's disease]], and impairs the [[immune system]].
#Cells – too many, aka [[cellular senescence]]:
#:This is a phenomenon where some cells can no longer [[cell division|divide]], but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other things that they're not supposed to, like secreting proteins that may be harmful. Cell senescence has been proposed as cause or consequence of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]].&lt;ref name="Testa_Ceriello"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pathogenetic Loop Between Diabetes and Cell Senescence|journal=Diabetes Care|year=2007|first=Roberto|last=Testa|author2=Antonio Ceriello|volume=30|issue=11|pages=2974–2975|id= |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/11/2974.full|format=|accessdate=29 December 2012|doi=10.2337/dc07-1534|pmid=17965314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immune senescence is also caused by this.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
#Extracellular protein crosslinks:
#:Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many cross-links form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[presbyopia]].&lt;ref name="050411_aubrey_interview.html"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/6967-hang-25-year-wait-immortality.html Hang in There: The 25-Year Wait for Immortality] interview with LiveScience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deGrey GSP2009"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTMNfU7zftQ&amp;t=20m2s |title=Aubrey de Grey – In Pursuit of Longevity |publisher=[[Singularity University]] |date=22 February 2010 |people=Aubrey de Grey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
De Grey is also a cryonicist, having signed up with [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Aubrey de Grey, PHD, An Exclusive Interview with the Renowned Biogerontologist |url= http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2006/2/profile/Page-01 |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has supported and advocated human cryopreservation, for example by signing an open letter to support research into cryonics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Scientists Open Letter on Cryonics |url= http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/scientists-open-letter-on-cryonics/ |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by being an advisor to a UK cryonics and cryopreservation advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= List of Advisors |url= http://www.cryonics-research.org.uk/about-us.html |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
On April 8 2018 de Grey posted a paper to the [[arXiv]] explicitly constructing a unit-distance graph which cannot be colored with fewer than 5 colors. The previous lower bound is due to the [[Hadwiger–Nelson problem|problem's]] original proposal in 1950 by [[Hugo Hadwiger]] and [[Edward Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Criticism==

===''Technology Review'' debate===
In 2005, ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'', in cooperation with the Methuselah Foundation, announced a $20,000 prize for any molecular biologist who could demonstrate that SENS was "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate." The judges of the challenge were [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], and [[Craig Venter]]. Five submissions were made, of which three met the terms of the challenge. De Grey wrote a rebuttal to each submission, and the challengers wrote responses to each rebuttal. The judges concluded that none of the challengers had disproved SENS, but the magazine opined that one of the rebuttals had been particularly eloquent and well written, and awarded the contestant $10,000. The judges also noted "the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for SENS," and wrote that many of its proposals could not be verified with the current level of scientific knowledge and technology, concluding that "SENS does not compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists; but neither is it demonstrably wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/|title=Is Defeating Aging Only a Dream?|publisher=Technology Review|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics single out three proposed therapies for criticism: somatic telomerase deletion, somatic mitochondrial genome engineering, and the use of transgenic microbial hydrolase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal.pdf|title=Life Extension Pseudoscience and the SENS Plan|publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EMBO Reports===
A 2005 article about SENS published in the viewpoint section of ''[[EMBO Reports]]'' by 28 scientists concluded that none of de Grey's therapies "has ever been shown to extend the lifespan of any organism, let alone humans".&lt;ref name=EMBOSENS&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=H. |last1=Warner |first2=J. |last2=Anderson |first3=S. |last3=Austad |first4=E. |last4=Bergamini |first5=D. |last5=Bredesen |first6=R. |last6=Butler |first7=B.

&lt;/ref&gt; The SENS Research Foundation, of which de Grey was a cofounder, seems to agree with the EMBO Report as it states, "If you want to reverse the damage of aging right now I'm afraid the simple answer is, you can't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sens.org/sens-research/faq|title=SENS Research Foundation FAQ|publisher=SENS Research Foundation|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, de Grey argues that this reveals a serious gap in understanding between basic scientists and technologists and between biologists studying aging and those studying regenerative medicine.&lt;ref name=EMBOSENSREPLY&gt;{{Cite journal

He is the Chief Scientist of Hanson Robotics, the creator of the robot [[Sophia (robot)|Sophia]].

==Views on AI==

In May 2007, Goertzel spoke at a [[Google]] Tech talk about his approach to creating Artificial General Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-dycsiRwB4 Google Tech Talk by Ben Goertzel], 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He defines intelligence as the ability to detect patterns in the world and in the agent itself, measurable in terms of [[emergent behavior]] of "achieving complex goals in complex environments."&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Thinking Machines: The Search for Artificial Intelligence|journal=Distillations |date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=14–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/thinking-machines-the-search-for-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "baby-like" artificial intelligence is initialized, then trained as an agent in a simulated or virtual world such as [[Second Life]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6992613.stm "Online worlds to be AI incubators"], [[BBC]] News, 13 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to produce a more powerful intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyId=11&amp;articleId=9036438&amp;intsrc=hm_topic "Virtual worlds making artificial intelligence apps 'smarter'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021201150/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyId=11&amp;articleId=9036438&amp;intsrc=hm_topic |date=October 21, 2007 }}, ''[[Computerworld]]'', 13 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge is represented in a network whose nodes and links carry probabilistic [[truth value]]s as well as "attention values," with the attention values resembling the weights in a [[neural network]]. Several algorithms operate on this network, the central one being a combination of a probabilistic [[inference engine]] and a custom version of [[evolutionary programming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chainhead.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WCCI06_Patterns-1.pdf "Patterns, Hypergraphs and Embodied General Intelligence"], Ben Goertzel, WCCI Panel Discussion: [http://139.78.75.247/WCCI-Web_Panel_bio.html "A Roadmap to Human-Level Intelligence"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Goertzel claimed that this combination is able to avoid the combinatorial explosions that both these algorithms suffer from when exposed to large problems.

The '''birthday effect''' (sometimes called the '''birthday blues''', especially when referring specifically to [[suicide]]) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on or close to their [[birthday]]. The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in [[England and Wales]],&lt;ref name="E&amp;W"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Relationship between month of birth and month of death in the elderly|first1=M|last1=Anderson|journal=British Journal of Preventive &amp; Social Medicine|year=1975|volume=29|issue=3|pages=151–156|pmc=478908|pmid=1191883}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref name="Swiss1992"&gt;{{cite journal|title=[Mortality and birthdays]|first1=J|last1=Bovet|first2=J|last2=Spagnoli|first3=C|last3=Sudan|journal=Sozial-und Praventivmedizin|year=1997|volume=42|issue=3|pages=151–161|pmid=9334087|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swiss2008"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death has a preference for birthdays—an analysis of death time series|first1=Vladeta|last1=Ajdacic-Gross|display-authors=etal|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|year=2012|volume=22|issue=8|pages=603–606|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104727971200110X|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.04.016|pmid=22658822}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref name="Ukraine"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variation of mortality rate during the individual annual cycle|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9087987|first1=Alexander|last1=Vaiserman|first2=Pavel|last2=Grigoryev|first3=Irina|last3=Belaya|first4=Vladimir|last4=Voitenko|journal=Biogerontology|year=2003|volume=4|issue=4|pages=221–225|doi=10.1023/A:1025168932058}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="California"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Birthday: Lifeline or Deadline?|first1=David|last1=Phillips|first2=Camilla|last2=Van Voorhees|first3=Todd|last3=Ruth|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1992|volume=54|issue=5|pages=532–542|url=http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/1992/09000/The_birthday__lifeline_or_deadline__.1.aspx|doi=10.1097/00006842-199209000-00001|citeseerx=10.1.1.103.5726}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A not so happy day after all: Excess death rates on birthdays in the U.S|first1=Pablo|last1=Peña|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2015|volume=126|pages=59–66|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614008120|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.014|pmid=25528555}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in smaller populations such as [[Major League Baseball]] players.&lt;ref name="MLB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge in the run-up to the birthday,&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; while others find no [[statistical significance|significant]] gender effect.&lt;ref name="Austria"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Longevity and month of birth: Evidence from Austria and Denmark|first1=Gabrielle|last1=Doblhammer|journal=Demographic Research|year=1999|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol1/3/default.htm|doi=10.4054/DemRes.1999.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deaths and major biographical events: a study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009|first1=Daniel|last1=Medenwald|first2=Oliver|last2=Kuss|journal=BMJ Open|year=2014|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/4/e004423.long|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004423|pmid=24694623|pmc=3987729|pages=e004423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased [[mortality salience]], or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;

==Studies==
[[File:GabbyHartnettGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gabby Hartnett]] is one of the statistically unusual number of [[MLB]] players to have died on his birthday.&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;]]
With the introduction of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies have been carried out to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as [[seasonality]] in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on [[February 29]], there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

A similar study among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest mortality on the actual birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80;&lt;ref name="Swiss1992"/&gt; another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess and was able to link this to specific causes: [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths.&lt;ref name="Swiss2008"/&gt; Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%.&lt;ref name="USA"/&gt; An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt; Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt; and people with entries in the ''Encyclopedia of American History''.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

Focusing on suicide deaths alone, large studies have found evidence for a peak in suicides on or just after a birthday in [[Denmark]]&lt;ref name="Denmark"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Postponed Suicide Death? Suicides around Birthdays and Major Public Holidays|first1=Gert|last1=Jessen|first2=Børge|last2=Jensen|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|year=1999|volume=29|issue=3|pages=272–283|doi=10.1111/j.1943-278X.1999.tb00302.x|doi-broken-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name="Hungary"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Birthday on the Fluctuation of Suicides in Hungary (1970–2002)|first1=Tamás|last1=Zonda|first2=Károly|last2=Bozsonyi|first3=Előd|last3=Veres|first4=Zoltán|last4=Kmetty|journal=Review of Sociology|year=2010|volume=20|issue=2|pages=96–105|url=http://www.szociologia.hu/dynamic/revsoc_2010_2_96_105_bozsonyi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not in [[Bavaria]]&lt;ref name="Bavaria"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The myth of the birthday blues: a population-based study about the association between birthday and suicide|first1=Udo|last1=Reulbach|first2=Teresa|last2=Biermann|first3=Katrin|last3=Markovic|first4=Johannes|last4=Kornhuber|first5=Stefan|last5=Bleich|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|year=2007|volume=48|issue=6|pages=554–557|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X07000867|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2007.06.006|pmid=17954141}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Bavaria"/&gt;

However, other studies have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and [[Austria]] (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that although people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more likely to die in the months further from their birthday.&lt;ref name="Austria"/&gt; A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect.&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; A small study by [[Leonard Zusne]] found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zusne"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Some Factors Affecting the Birthday-Deathday Phenomenon|first1=Leonard|last1=Zusne|journal=Omega: Journal of Death and Dying|year=1987|volume=17|issue=1|pages=9–26|url=http://ome.sagepub.com/content/17/1/9.short|doi=10.2190/RR4D-4W0L-5QAK-X4YX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but [[Simpson's paradox|it was not seen in the population as a whole]].&lt;ref name="E&amp;W"/&gt;

==Possible explanations==

===External causes===
Birthday celebrations are often associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. [[Binge drinking]] can [[Alcohol and health|increase an individual's risk of death]] through [[alcohol poisoning]], accidents and [[drunk driving]], as well as by exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hungary"/&gt; In the USA where the drinking age is 21, there is a very large mortality rate excess on the 21st birthday and the day immediately following, almost entirely attributable to an increase in accidents.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|volume=1|issue=1)|pages=164–182|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|doi=10.1257/app.1.1.164|pmid=20351794|pmc=2846371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alcoholappendix"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age (Web Appendix A and B)|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/articles-attachments/aej/app/app/2007-0089_app.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosomatic and psychological===
{{see also|Mortality salience}}
Two mutually contradictory explanations have been put forward that rely on [[psychosomatic]] effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion to look back on life.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/22/news/birthdays-a-matter-of-life-and-death.html|first1=Sandra|last1=Blakeslee|title=Birthdays: a Matter Of Life and Death|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 September 1992|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[terror management theory]], this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both may play a role in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the [[public sphere]] of life (for example, [[career]]-driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the [[private sphere]] (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Related is the "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering [[suicidal ideation]] will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve.&lt;ref name="Hungary"/&gt;

The psychosomatic/psychological model would also explain the similar increase in cancer deaths around holidays such as [[Christmas]],&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; and is supported by the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a [[Passover]] effect among the Jewish community (which moves [[Passover#Date and duration|with the festival itself]]), and a [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] effect among the Chinese.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Physiological===
It has been suggested that, like the 24-hour [[circadian rhythm]], the body also has a yearly "circannual" [[biological rhythm]]. Vaiserman et al. have suggested that the climatic conditions at birth act as a [[zeitgeber]] that triggers internal stress and increases the chance of death.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt;

===Statistical===
It is possible when processing [[death certificate]]s to confuse the date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as placeholders.&lt;ref name="Heaping"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heaping in Anniversary Reaction Studies: A Cautionary Note|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Omega: Journal of Death and Dying|year=2006|volume=54|issue=1|pages=59–65|url=http://ome.sagepub.com/content/54/1/59.short|doi=10.2190/V752-6773-1KMW-3334}}&lt;/ref&gt; These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which are unlikely to be caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R. Jr|title=The Background of Coleridge's Theory of Life|journal=|date=1954|volume=33|issue=The University of Texas Studies in English|page=60|jstor=20776075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dark Judges''' are recurring villains in the ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' science fiction comic strip in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[comic book|comic]] ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''. They also appear in the 2003 computer game ''[[Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death]]''. They are '''[[Judge Death]]''', '''Judge Fire''', '''Judge Fear''', and '''Judge Mortis'''. Later storylines added the "Sisters of Death" ('''Phobia''' and '''Nausea''') to their ranks. Former [[Judge Kraken]] was also a Dark Judge for a brief time during the ''Necropolis'' story.

The Dark Judges were originally a group of four lawkeepers from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel dimension]].  They were led by [[Judge Death]], who had determined that all crime was committed by the living - thus, by his logic, all life was a crime. The other three were slavishly devoted to him and his philosophy, and the four went around killing people on whatever justification they could find (Judge Fire sentenced a whole school to death for noise pollution). The society of the parallel universe they inhabited placed very little value on human life and many inhabitants were sadistic and violent, but even by the standards of their people the Dark Judges were vicious.

Things changed when Death encountered Phobia and Nausea (the future ''Sisters of Death'') in a cave. The Sisters were [[destructive cult|death cult]]ists and mass murderers with [[supernatural]] powers, and Death fell in love; the three of them committed acts on victims that he admitted sickened even him. With their help, he and his acolytes were able to become [[undead]] beings, thus being 'pure' to judge without hypocrisy. The Sisters would themselves become ethereal beings with hideous magical powers. The Dark Judges subsequently murdered the entire population of their world.

Dimension-travelling visitors chanced upon the now 'Deadworld' and found the Dark Judges. After 'judging' (i.e., killing) them and taking their dimension jumping warp devices, Judge Death travelled to [[Mega-City One]], against the opinions of his colleagues, in order to 'dispense justice'. Death was eventually defeated by the combined efforts of [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judges]] Dredd and [[Judge Anderson|Anderson]], his body having been destroyed, and his spirit form held inside Judge Anderson, herself encased in the miracle plastic [[List of technology in Judge Dredd#Boing!|Boing]] on display in the Justice Department's Hall of Heroes.

Having sensed Death's peril, his comrades Fear, Fire and Mortis crossed the dimension warp to rescue him. Released from imprisonment and with a new body created, the four Dark Judges continued their 'judgement' upon Mega-City One claiming thousands of victims. Dredd and Anderson intervened, and pursued the Dark Judges back to Deadworld using a Dimension Jump Globe liberated from the Dark Judges. There, the spirits of the Dark Judges' millions of victims flowed through Anderson and seemingly extinguished their spirits forever.

However, the Dark Judges were not destroyed but merely weakened, and four years later, Judge Anderson was duped into returning to Deadworld, where she was forced to resurrect them. Armed with [[Teleportation|teleporter]] technologies, the four returned to Mega-City One, leaving Anderson for dead. Anderson survived, however, and used the dimension warp technology against the Dark Judges, consigning them to limbo, the void between dimensions. This is where they were to remain for the next few years.

Following Judge Dredd's resignation and his replacement by the ex-[[Judge]] [[Judge Kraken|Kraken]] (recounted in the Judge Dredd stories ''[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)#"Tale of the Dead Man"|Tale of the Dead Man]]'' and ''Countdown to [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]]'' respectively), the sisters of Death - Phobia and Nausea - used their powers to influence Kraken and rescue the Dark Judges from Limbo.  With the Mega-City One judge force under their control, the Dark Judges created [[Necropolis (Judge Dredd story)|Necropolis]] - the city of the dead, killing 60 million citizens. Judges Dredd, Anderson and [[Judge McGruder|Chief Judge McGruder]], together with a handful of [[Judge (2000 AD)#Training|cadet judges]], returned via [[Undercity (Judge Dredd)|The Undercity]] to defeat them - returning the Sisters of Death to Deadworld, imprisoning Fear, Fire and Mortis within secure containment, and executing Kraken, who had become a fifth Dark Judge.

Judge Death eluded capture by hiding in the burial pits of the [[Cursed Earth]] and departed for another dimension, but was eventually captured by Dredd with the aid of [[Batman]] (see ''[[Judgement on Gotham]]''). Judge Death would escape several other times, with the most significant being when the Joker (see below) dimension-jumped to Mega-City One and freed the four prisoners when they were being transferred to a more secure prison. They entered a sealed hedonist community and slaughtered their way through it before Dredd, Anderson, and Batman could stop them again.

In 2124, Death was released again - after a series of child murders to bring out Anderson, he beat her into a coma so she couldn't track him, infected her with the supernatural Half-Life virus, and escaped into the Cursed Earth. He then went on a killing spree and searched for [[weapons of mass destruction]], finally taking out [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] before seemingly being destroyed by the angry ghosts of his victims. However, the Sisters of Death - now with three extra members - attacked again in 2127, striking blocks with poltergeist activity and plagues before Psi-Division drove them back; and during Death's time in the Cursed Earth, he created another undead killer named Mordechai to carry on after him.

In 2134, during a major Soviet-backed attack on Mega-City One, Soviet sleeper agent Judge Haldane used a forged warrant to enter the Dark Judge containment vault and open the containment vessels. He stole the imprisoned Fear, Fire, and Mortis, and with another sleeper agent he gave the Dark Judges physical form again. (They promptly killed the agents, to Haldane's horror.)&lt;ref&gt;Progs 1779-1781, "[[Day of Chaos]]: Eve Of Destruction"&lt;/ref&gt; They were later captured by genius serial killer [[PJ Maybe]].&lt;ref&gt;''2000 AD'' #1786&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Death was freed from Hell by the Sisters of Death.&lt;ref&gt;''2000 AD'' #1912&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the home of PJ Maybe and rescued his brothers. They escaped from Earth on a spaceship, the ''Mayflower'', and killed most of the passengers and crew. They were pursued by Dredd and Anderson, who managed to defeat them and left them stranded in space.&lt;ref&gt;''2000 AD'' #2015 and #1912-1921&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character details==
The Dark Judges are [[undead]], and as such, cannot be conventionally killed. Their true forms are [[incorporeal]] spirits that must inhabit corpses in order to cause physical harm. This involves obtaining recently deceased cadavers, which are subsequently processed by machinery that produces "dead fluids." These fluids bring the corpses to "full ripeness," prefatory for the spirits to inhabit and animate. The incarnate Dark Judges are emaciated, [[zombie]]-like humanoids with sharp claws that frequently serve for them to injure their victims. All four speak with a hiss.

Once incarnated, the Dark Judges don uniforms (or "robes of office") which reflect their identities. The uniforms are variants of the traditional [[Judge (2000 AD)|judge]] uniforms, with specific modifications based upon the judges' personalities.

'''[[Judge Death]]''' wears a [[helmet]] similar to that of a traditional Judge, with a modified visor resembling a [[portcullis]]. His mouth is pulled into a rictus. In place of the Judges' eagle-shaped shoulder [[pauldrons]], Death sports a [[pterodactyl]] on his right shoulder; his left shoulder and elbow pads are festooned with bones. His jacket is fastened with crude stitches rather than a zipper, and his badge and belt buckle are each shaped like a human skull with extended fangs, the latter is also adorned with bat wings. Death most often kills his victims by reaching directly into their chests (in an intangible state) and squeezing their hearts until they burst, without ever breaking the skin.

[[Image:Gazeintofist.jpg|thumb|400px|"Gaze into the fist of Dredd!" - artwork by [[Brian Bolland]]]]
'''Judge Fear''' is an imposing figure who wears a black [[great helm]] accented with large, bat-like wings. When passing judgement, he opens his helmet's faceplate and frightens the accused to death with whatever lies within, whilst reciting his catch phrase, "Gaze into the face of Fear!" The actual face under the helmet has only been revealed twice: once as a mass of eyeballs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/851294-judge_fear_5.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423211727/http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/851294-judge_fear_5.png |archivedate=2018-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on another occasion as several grotesque mandibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/851295-judge_fear_6.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423211727/http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/22955/851295-judge_fear_6.png |archivedate=2018-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No explanation has been given as to whether these monstrosities are indicative of Fear's physical face, or if they are simply manifestations of his victims' fears. Fear sports an assortment of tools on his belt, notably miniature [[animal trapping|bear traps]], which he is known to throw at his enemies in order to immobilize them; and an enormous padlock which he uses to secure his victims' potential exit routes. His belt buckle is a [[shrunken head]]. In "Die laughing" the shrunken head was revealed to be an explosive weapon, similar in effect to a hand grenade, when Judge Fear used it in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Batman. He wears a heavy black cape with large, bear trap shoulder [[pauldrons]]. In Progs. 421 and 423, Judge Fear is seen to exhibit powers similar to Judge Death's "phasing" ability, thrusting his hands through victims' bodies.

'''Judge Fire''' is immersed head-to-toe in ethereal [[flame]]. He wears no helmet, and instead has a human skull for a head. He wields a flame-spewing [[trident]]. He earned the name "Judge Fire" when he was still alive, after he burned down a school for violating noise regulations.

'''Judge Mortis''' is in a perpetual state of disintegration, and his touch can cause spontaneous decay at a rapid rate. His head is a sheep skull and he has a bony tail. His uniform's right shoulder pauldron is a bird skeleton, and his left shoulder is protected by a perforated mantle. His badge is a stylized sheep skull with his name emblazoned in wood. Like Fire and Fear, Mortis spent his early years as a rookie Judge at Law School, Deadworld's equivalent to [[Mega-City One]]'s [[Academy of Law]], and graduated after [[Judge Death|Sidney De'ath]]. He developed an admiration for Sidney's methods and beliefs, and shares his comrades' zeal for passing arbitrary death sentences. He is sometimes employed by Judge Death to prepare the Dark Judges' host bodies.

===Additional characters===

* '''Nausea''' is a haglike, decayed humanoid with an assortment of gory tentacles, claws and eyeballs on her right shoulder and elbows. Her left shoulder has two apparently live human heads on it. Her badge is a human skull, much like Death's. Both she and Phobia have supernatural and psychic powers, including the power to increase decay and darken the sun in areas. As spectral beings, they cannot be physically damaged and need only a psychic anchor in Mega-City One to attack.
* '''Phobia''' looks much like her sister, but has an extended proboscis and live heads as earrings. Her right shoulder is covered by a large scorpion, and her elbows and knees by spiders. Snakes wrap around her arms. Her left shoulder is a mass of worms, and her badge is a spider.

The undead incarnations of Nausea and Phobia normally only appear as [[spirit]]s, although they do appear in their mortal form in the Judge Death [[prequel]] story, ''Young Death: Boyhood of a Superfiend''.

* '''[[Judge Kraken]]''' (using the name '''Dredd'''), while a Dark Judge, was appropriately decayed. He suffered the loss of his right hand by inadvertently trying to use another judge's [[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|lawgiver]], thereby setting off its self-destruct mechanism. He wore the usual Judge's uniform, though it was cracked and deformed. Unlike the others, he was forcibly turned into a Dark Judge by Death and made to kill people against his will, while being allowed his normal feeling and remorse as "a final twist of the knife".
* '''Pustula''', '''Ephemera''' and '''Dementia''' are three "cousins" of the Sisters. Pustula is an obese, boil and pus-ridden monster who spreads the "blisteria-101" virus, which turns its victims, including robots, into a mass of boils. Ephemera is a naked ghostly figure with a mane of hair, who creates heavy [[poltergeist]] activity. Dementia resembles a normal human, naked, and surrounded by bats - covering her breasts and genitalia - and toxic mud on her hands, who inspires waves of suicidal dementia. Where they came from is unknown.
* '''Half Life''' was a formerly human victim of the Sisters, before being turned into an insect-headed, poison-spreading monster. His toxic, disease-ridden spirit was turned into a psychic virus, one that Judge Death infected Anderson's mind with when he defeated her in 2124. When modified by the insane Judge Fauster of [[Psi Division]]'s Department of Magic, it became a psychic infection, inspiring a wave of mass murder across Mega-City One.
* '''Mordechai''', while not said to be a Dark Judge, was another one of Death's creations and possessed similar powers and motive. A walking corpse, he possessed telekinesis and plants rotted at his passing. He considered himself working for the Cursed Earth itself, keeping it free of life.

In February 2014, IDW announced that nine new Dark Judges were to premiere in a forthcoming Judge Dredd title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/11/judge-dredd-takes-on-judge-death-and-the-dark-judges|title=Judge Dredd Takes on Judge Death and The Dark Judges|first=Joshua|last=Yehl|date=11 February 2014|website=ign.com|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324105051/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/11/judge-dredd-takes-on-judge-death-and-the-dark-judges|archivedate=24 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDW Dredd is usually considered non-canonical.  The new judges were:

* '''Judge Choke''', a skeleton surrounded by fog that choked its victims.
* '''Judge Sleep''', a female dark judge that put her victims into an endless sleep.
* '''Judge Stigmata''', a humanoid covered in cuts and carrying a knife in its stomach who induced its victims to self-harm.
* '''Judge Burroughs''', a mole-like creature that created tunnels that destroyed buildings.
* '''Judge Sludge''', capable of spraying victims in a thick ooze.
* '''Judge Fistula''', a walking, talking tumor that stabbed victims with extruded tendrils.
* '''Judge Skinner''', a humanoid with transparent skin who could magically remove its victims's skins.
* '''Judge Metastasis''', a conglomerate being composed of many victims, each of whom it summoned to join the whole, forming a human-shaped giant.
* '''Judge Blank''', a creature of pure void that could teleport victims.  Judge Blank was not in league with the others and was implied to be Judge Anderson.

The ''Dreams of Deadworld''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/08/the-dark-judges-returning-to-2000ad-for-dreams-of-deadworld.html flickeringmyth.com] "The Dark Judges returning to 2000 AD for Dreams of Deadworld"&lt;/ref&gt; arc in the September 2015 2000 ADs introduced dark judges that existed on Deadworld prior to a coup by Death and his three lieutenants.  They were:

* '''Judge Reaper''', a large, male human with a dark, empty face.
* '''Sister Despair''', a female who teams up with Judge Reaper.
* '''Judge Omen''', who was [[Precognition|precognitive]].
* '''Judge Flyblown''', an obese man with [[digitigrade]] legs.
* '''Judge Ossify''', a misshapen giant with protruding bones.
* '''Sister Bedlam''', a female with a vertically-oriented mouth.
* '''Judge Silence''', who held his hands over his mouth and said nothing.
* '''Judge Scourge''', who attacked with spike-studded tentacles.

==The Joker as a Dark Judge==
For a very brief time, DC comic's [[Joker (comics)|"The Joker"]] character was a Dark Judge, in the original graphic novel ''Die Laughing'' (1998). The Joker helped free the original Dark Judges in exchange for immortality. He received his payment by having his spirit merged into a corpse (which was not quite the "immortality" he'd sought), creating "Judge Joker". As a Dark Judge, the Joker could kill masses of people with his laugh, which caused human heads to explode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everydayislikewednesday.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/the-batmanjudge-dredd-collection-part-4.html Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817091039/http://everydayislikewednesday.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/the-batmanjudge-dredd-collection-part-4.html |date=2016-08-17 }} at Every Day is Like Wednesday website (retrieved 4 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

His tenure was a brief one, as he quickly became bored with slaughter simply for its own sake and did not share the original Dark Judge's fanatical zeal for their "sacred mission" of purging all life. The Joker was restored to his normal, mortal form upon returning to [[Gotham City]] via a defective dimensional jump device.

==Deadworld Judges==

The Judges of Deadworld wore similar uniforms to those of Mega-City One judges, coloured black with red trim; and a pterodactyl device on the right shoulderpad. They were brutal and a law unto themselves: a recruitment poster exhorted candidates to join the Judges and offered such incentives as ''"Beat people up. Kill anyone you like (within reason). Good rates of pay. Plenty of graft. Vicious nature a plus. [[Luncheon Voucher|LUNCHEON VOUCHERS]]."''&lt;ref&gt;''Young Death: Boyhood of a Superfiend'', [[Judge Dredd Megazine]] issues 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly they easily attracted psychopaths such as the future Dark Judges; and in their last days applied the death penalty for even the slightest of misdemeanors. When the Dark Judges seized power, the Deadworld Judges were inspired to join them and assisted in the massacre of the entire population before being killed themselves.

Deadworld, despite having a Judge system and having some degree of future tech, did not possess [[City Block (Judge Dredd)|City Block]]s or most of the features the Mega-Cities do, instead being very much like 20th Century Earth. Dreaming was considered abnormal and dangerous, and those who dreamt repeatedly were often Psis, who were rounded up by the Judges. Instead of the Academy of Law, they had Law School overseen by a Principal. Trainee Judges would spend a day in court, sentencing minor offenders (a young Death would be told that it would be "fine" to sentence a minor offender to death and borderline acceptable to kill two or three).

{{Evolutionary biology}}
A '''digital organism''' is a [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] [[computer program]] that [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutates]] and [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolves]].  Digital [[organism]]s are used as a tool to study the dynamics of Darwinian [[evolution]], and to test or verify specific hypotheses or [[mathematical model]]s of evolution.  The study of digital organisms is closely related to the area of [[artificial life]].

== History ==
Digital organisms can be traced back to the game [[Darwin (programming game)|Darwin]], developed in 1961 at Bell Labs, in which computer programs had to compete with each other by trying to stop others from [[Execution (computing)|executing]] .&lt;ref&gt;Aleph-Null, "Computer Recreations", Software: Practice and Experience, vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–96, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; A similar implementation that followed this was the game [[Core War]]. In Core War, it turned out that one of the winning [[strategy|strategies]] was to replicate as fast as possible, which deprived the opponent of all [[resource (computer science)|computational resources]].  Programs in the Core War game were also able to mutate themselves and each other by overwriting instructions in the simulated "memory" in which the game took place.  This allowed competing programs to embed damaging instructions in each other that caused errors (terminating the process that read it), "enslaved processes" (making an enemy program work for you), or even change strategies mid-game and heal themselves.

[[Steen Rasmussen]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] took the idea from Core War one step further in his core world system by introducing a genetic algorithm that automatically wrote programs. However, Rasmussen did not observe the evolution of complex and stable programs. It turned out that the [[programming language]] in which core world programs were written was very brittle, and more often than not mutations would completely destroy the functionality of a program.

The first to solve the issue of program brittleness was [[Thomas S. Ray]] with his [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] system, which was similar to core world. Ray made some key changes to the programming language such that mutations were much less likely to destroy a program. With these modifications, he observed for the first time computer programs that did indeed evolve in a meaningful and complex way.

Later, [[Chris Adami]], Titus Brown, and [[Charles Ofria]] started developing their [[Avida]] system,&lt;ref&gt;http://avida.devosoft.org/&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by Tierra but again had some crucial differences. In Tierra, all programs lived in the same [[address space]] and could potentially overwrite or otherwise interfere with each other. In Avida, on the other hand, each program lives in its own address space. Because of this modification, experiments with Avida became much cleaner and easier to interpret than those with Tierra. With Avida, digital organism research has begun to be accepted as a valid contribution to evolutionary biology by a growing number of evolutionary biologists.  Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lenski]] of [[Michigan State University]] has used Avida extensively in his work.  Lenski, Adami, and their colleagues have published in journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (USA).

In 1996, Andy Pargellis created a Tierra-like system called ''Amoeba'' that evolved self-replication from a randomly seeded initial condition.

'''Emptiness''' as a [[human condition]] is a sense of generalized [[boredom]], [[social alienation]] and [[apathy]]. Feelings of emptiness often accompany [[dysthymia]],&lt;ref&gt;Downs, A. The Half-Empty Heart: A supportive guide to breaking free from chronic discontent. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[loneliness]], [[anhedonia]],
[[wiktionary:despair|despair]], or other mental/emotional disorders, including [[schizoid personality disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post trauma]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].  A sense of emptiness is also part of a natural process of [[grief]], as resulting of [[wikt:separation|separation]], [[death]] of a loved one, or other significant changes. However, the particular meanings of “emptiness” vary with the particular context and the religious or cultural tradition in which it is used.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/186253/emptiness#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=emptiness%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=emptiness (mysticism) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Christianity and Western sociologists and psychologists view a state of emptiness as a negative, unwanted condition, in some Eastern philosophies such as [[Buddhist philosophy]] and [[Taoism]], emptiness ([[Śūnyatā]]) represents seeing through the illusion of independent self-nature.

==In Western culture==

===Sociology, philosophy, and psychology===
In the West, feeling "empty" is often viewed as a negative condition. Psychologist Clive Hazell, for example, attributes feelings of emptiness to problematic family backgrounds with abusive relationships and mistreatment.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Adams, Ivan Fras, "Beginning Child Psychiatry", page 208. Brunner Routledge (UK), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that some people who are facing a sense of emptiness try to resolve their painful feelings by becoming addicted to a drug or obsessive activity (be it compulsive sex, gambling or work) or engaging in "frenzied action" or violence. In sociology, a sense of emptiness is associated with [[social alienation]] of the individual. This sense of alienation may be suppressed while working, due to the routine nature of work tasks, but during leisure hours or during the weekend, people may feel a sense of "existential vacuum" and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindnc.com/psyall/Existentialism_A_Brief_Overview.pdf |website=Mind NC |date=2012-02-16 |title=Existentialism A Brief Overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005043502/http://www.mindnc.com/psyall/Existentialism_A_Brief_Overview.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In political philosophy, emptiness is associated with [[nihilism]]. Literary critic [[Georg Lukács]] (born in 1885) argued against the "spiritual emptiness and moral inadequacy of capitalism", and argued in favour of communism as an "entirely new type of civilization, one that promised a fresh start and an opportunity to lead a meaningful and purposeful life."&lt;ref&gt;We Didn't Start the Fire: Capitalism and Its Critics, Then and Now. By Sheri Berman, in Foreign Affairs. http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20030701fareviewessay15413/sheri-berman/we-didn-t-start-the-fire-capitalism-and-its-critics-then-and-now.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "emptiness" was important to a "certain type of [[existentialist]] philosophy and some forms of the [[Death of God]] movement".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Existentialism, the "philosophic movement that gives voice to the sense of alienation and despair", comes from "man’s recognition of his fundamental aloneness in an indifferent universe". People whose response to the sense of emptiness and aloneness is to give excuses live in bad faith; "people who face the emptiness and accept responsibility aim to live 'authentic' lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~dougt/exist.htm |title=Existentialism |publisher=Personal.georgiasouthern.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216210805/http://personal.georgiasouthern.edu/~dougt/exist.htm |archivedate=2012-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialists argue that "man lives in alienation from God, from nature, from other men, from his own true self." Crowded into cities, working in mindless jobs, and entertained by light mass media, we "live on the surface of life", so that even "people who seemingly have 'everything' feel empty, uneasy, discontented."&lt;ref name=mrjeffrey&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrjeffrey.com/English%20IV/Existentialism/A_Primer_of_Existentialism.doc |website=iClass Zone |title=A Primer of Existentialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures where a sense of emptiness is seen as a negative psychological condition, it is often associated with depression. As such, many of the same treatments are proposed: [[psychotherapy]], group therapy, or other types of counselling. As well, people who feel empty may be advised to keep busy and maintain a regular schedule of work and social activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Other solutions which have been proposed to reduce a sense of emptiness are getting a [[pet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petnet.com.au/releases/17121999.html Petnet - Responsible Ownership in Australia - And then there were two!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalo.edu/reporter/vol28/vol28n25/f1.html Mar. 27, 1997-Vol28n25: Research provides further evidence that pets, music effective at reducing stress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or trying [[Animal-Assisted Therapy]]; getting involved in [[spirituality]] such as [[meditation]] or [[religion|religious]] rituals and service; [[Volunteering|volunteer]]ing to fill time and bring social contact; doing [[social interaction]]s, such as community activities, clubs, or outings; or finding a hobby or recreational activity to regain their interest in life.

===Christianity===
In Austrian philosopher/educator [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s (1861–1925) thinking, spiritual emptiness was a major problem in the educated European middle class. In his 1919 lectures he argued that European culture became "empty of spirit" and "ignorant of the needs, the conditions, that are essential for the life of the spirit". People experienced a "spiritual emptiness"  and their thinking became marked by a "lazy passivity" due to the "absence of will from the life of thought". In modern Europe, Steiner claimed that people would "allow their thoughts to take possession of them", and these thoughts were increasingly filled with abstraction and "pure, natural scientific thinking". The educated middle classes began to think in a way that was "devoid of spirit", with their minds becoming "dimmer and darker", and increasing empty of spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/SpiEmp_index.html |title=Lecture: Spiritual Emptiness and Social Life |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |date=1919-04-13 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Dupré, a Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, argues that the "spiritual emptiness of our time is a symptom of its religious poverty". He claims that "many people never experience any emptiness: they are too busy to feel much absence of any kind"; they only realize their spiritual emptiness if "painful personal experiences -- the death of a loved one, the collapse of a marriage, the alienation of a child, the failure of a business" shock them into reassessing their sense of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE SURVIVAL OF CHRISTIANITY:

Spiritual emptiness has been associated with juvenile violence. In John C. Thomas' 1999 book ''How Juvenile Violence Begins: Spiritual Emptiness'', he argues that youth in impoverished indigenous communities who feel empty may turn to fighting and aggressive crime to fill their sense of meaninglessness. In Cornell University professor [[James Garbarino]]'s 1999 book ''Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them'', he argues that "neglect, shame, spiritual emptiness, alienation, anger and access to guns are a few of the elements common to violent boys". A professor of human development, Garbarino claims that violent boys have an "alienation from positive role models" and "a spiritual emptiness that spawns despair". These youth are seduced by the violent fantasy of the US gun culture, which provides negative role models of tough, aggressive men who use power to get what they want. He claims that boys can be helped by giving them "a sense of purpose" and "spiritual anchors" that can "anchor boys in empathy and socially engaged moral thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |title=Cornell News: "Lost Boys" about teen violence |publisher=News.cornell.edu |date=1999-04-23 |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617200955/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/April99/lost.boys.ssl.html |archivedate=2012-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritual emptiness is often connected with addiction, especially by Christian-influenced addiction organizations and counsellors. Bill Wilson, the founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], argued that one of the impacts of alcoholism was causing a spiritual emptiness in heavy drinkers. In Abraham J. Twerski's 1997 book ''Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception'', he argues that when people feel spiritually empty, they often turn to addictive behaviors to fill the inner void. In contrast to having an empty stomach, which is a clear feeling, having spiritual emptiness is hard to identify, so it fills humans with a "vague unrest".  While people may try to resolve this emptiness by obsessively having sex, overeating, or taking drugs or alcohol, these addictions only give temporary satisfaction. When a person facing a crisis due to feeling spiritually empty is able to stop one addiction, such as compulsive sex, they often just trade it in for another addictive behaviour, such as gambling or overeating.&lt;ref&gt;Addictive Thinking: Understanding Self-Deception By Abraham J.

===Fiction, film, design and visual arts===
A number of novelists and filmmakers have depicted emptiness. The concept of "emptiness" was important to a "good deal of 19th–20th century Western imaginative literature".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Novelist [[Franz Kafka]] depicted a meaningless bizarre world in ''[[The Trial]]'' and the [[existentialism|existentialist]] French authors sketched a world cut off from purpose or reason in [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[La Nausée]]'' and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'étranger]]''. Existentialism influenced 20th century poet [[T.S. Eliot]], whose poem “[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]”  describes an "anti-hero or alienated soul, running away from or confronting the emptiness of his or her existence". Professor Gordon Bigelow argues that the existentialist theme of "spiritual barrenness is commonplace in literature of the 20th century", which in addition to Eliot includes [[Ernest Hemingway]], Faulkner, Steinbeck and Anderson.&lt;ref name=mrjeffrey/&gt;

Film adaptations of a number of existentialist novels capture the bleak sense of emptiness espoused by Sartre and Camus. This theme of emptiness has also been used in modern screenplays. [[Mark Romanek]]'s 1985 film ''[[Static (1986 film)|Static]]'' tells the surreal story of a struggling inventor and crucifix factory worker named Ernie who feels spiritually empty because he is saddened by his parents' death in an accident. Screenwriter Michael Tolkin's 1994 film ''[[The New Age (film)|The New Age]]'' examines "cultural hipness and spiritual emptiness", creating a "dark, ambitious, unsettling" film that depicts a fashionable LA couple who "are miserable in the midst of their sterile plenty", and whose souls are stunted by their lives of empty sex, consumption, and distractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Lisa Schwarzbaum|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303914,00.html |title=The New Age Review  |publisher=EW.com |date=1994-09-30 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' examines the spiritual emptiness of life in the US suburbs. In [[Wes Anderson]]'s 2007 film ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]'', three brothers who "... suffer from spiritual emptiness" and then "self-medicate themselves through sex, social withdrawal, and drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dibben |first=Chance |url=http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/nov/01/movie_review/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070422033055/http://www.kansan.com/stories/2007/nov/01/movie_review/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-04-22 |title=Movie review |publisher=Kansan.com |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2012-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The 2008 film ''[[The Informers (2008 film)|The Informers]]'' is a [[Hollywood]] [[drama]] film written by [[Bret Easton Ellis]] and [[Nicholas Jarecki]] and directed by [[Gregor Jordan]]. The film is based on Ellis' 1994 collection of short stories of the [[The Informers|same name]]. The film, which is set amidst the decadence of the early 1980s, depicts an assortment of socially alienated, mainly well-off characters who numb their sense of emptiness with casual sex, alcohol, and drugs. 

Contemporary architecture critic [[Herbert Muschamp]] argues that "[[horror vacui]]" (which is Latin for "fear of emptiness") is a key principle of design. He claims that it has become an obsessive quality that is the "driving force in contemporary American taste". Muschamp states that "along with the commercial interests that exploit this interest, it is the major factor now shaping attitudes toward public spaces, urban spaces, and even suburban sprawl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ho.html |title=ArtLex's Ho-Hz page |publisher=Artlex.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films that depict nothingness, shadows and vagueness, either in a visual sense or a moral sense are appreciated in genres such as [[film noir]]. As well, travellers and artists are often intrigued by and attracted to vast empty spaces, such as open deserts, barren wastelands or salt flats, and the open sea.

In visual arts emptiness and absence were recognized as phenomena that characterize not only particular works of [[art]] (e.g. [[Yves Klein]]) but also as a more general tendency within the history of [[modern art]] and [[aesthetics]]. Following [[Davor Džalto]]'s argument on the modern concept of art, the gradual elimination of particular elements that traditionally characterized [[visual arts]], which results in emptiness, is the most important phenomenon within the history and [[theory of art]] over the past two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instifdt.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Davor-Dzalto.pdf |title=Art: A Brief History of Absence (From the Conception and Birth, Life and Death, to the Living Deadness of Art) |publisher=Davor Džalto |date= |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Eastern cultures==

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Śūnyatā}}
The Buddhist term ''emptiness'' (Skt. ''[[śūnyatā]]'') refers specifically to the idea that everything is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]], including the causes and conditions themselves, and even the principle of causality itself.  It is not [[nihilism]], nor is it meditating on nothingness.&lt;ref name=lamazopa&gt;Interview on Emptiness by Lama Zopa Rinpoche. Available at: http://www.lamayeshe.com/lamazopa/interview.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, it refers to the absence (emptiness) of inherent existence.  [[Buddhapalita]] says:
{{cquote |What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence. Unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them.|30px|30px|{{IAST|''Buddhapālita-mula-madhyamaka-vrtti''}} P5242,73.5.6-74.1.2{{sfn|Tsong Khapa|2002}}}}

In an interview, the [[Dalai Lama]] stated that [[Tantra|tantric meditation]] can be used for "heightening your own realization of emptiness or [[bodhichitta|mind of enlightenment]]".&lt;ref&gt;''A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism with His Holiness the Dalai Lama''. Available at: http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/hhdl/survey.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhist philosophy]], attaining a realization of emptiness of inherent existence is key to the permanent cessation of [[suffering]], i.e. [[nirvana|liberation]].

{{cquote|Even while an ordinary being, if upon hearing of emptiness great joy arises within again and again, the eyes moisten with tears of great joy, and the hairs of the body stand on end, such a person has the seed of the mind of a complete Buddha; He is a vessel for teachings on [[tattva|thatness]], and ultimate truth should be taught to him. After that, good qualities will grow in him.|30px|30px|[[Chandrakirti]]|''Guide to the Middle Way,'' vv. 6:4-5&lt;ref&gt;translation in ''Ocean of Nectar'', pp. 151, 153&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Dalai Lama argues that tantric [[yoga]] trainees need to realize the emptiness of inherent existence before they can go on to the "highest yoga tantra initiation"; realizing the emptiness of inherent existence of the mind is the "fundamental innate mind of clear light, which is the subtlest level of the mind", where all "energy and mental processes are withdrawn or dissolved", so that all that appears to the mind is "pure emptiness". As well, emptiness is "linked to the creative Void, meaning that it is a state of complete receptivity and perfect enlightenment", the merging of the "ego with its own essence", which Buddhists call the "clear light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotinus.com/spiritual%20emptiness_copy.htm |title=About Spiritual Emptiness or the Void |publisher=Plotinus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ven. Thubten Chodron's 2005 interview with Lama Zopa Rinpoche, the lama noted that we "...ordinary beings who haven't realized emptiness don't see things as similar to illusions", and we do not "realize that things are merely labeled by mind and exist by mere name".&lt;ref name=lamazopa/&gt; He argues that "when we meditate on emptiness, we drop an atom bomb on this [sense of a] truly existent I" and we realize that "what appears true... isn't true". By this, the lama is claiming that what we think is real—our thoughts and feelings about people and things—"exists by being merely labeled". He argues that meditators who attain knowledge of a state of emptiness are able to realize that their thoughts are merely illusions from labelling by the mind.&lt;ref name=lamazopa/&gt;

===Taoism===
In [[Taoism]], attaining a state of emptiness is viewed as a state of stillness and placidity which is the "mirror of the universe" and the "pure mind".&lt;ref name=taopage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taopage.org/emptiness.html |title=Taoism - Wu - Emptiness |publisher=Taopage.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tao Te Ching]] claims that emptiness is related to the "Tao, the Great Principle, the Creator and Sustainer of everything in the universe". It is argued that it is the "state of mind of the Taoist disciple who follows the Tao", who has successfully emptied the mind "of all wishes and ideas not fitted with the Tao's Movement". For a person who attains a state of emptiness, the "still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the glass of all things", a state of "vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action" which is the "perfection of the Tao and its characteristics, the "mirror of the universe" and the "pure mind".&lt;ref name=taopage/&gt; In this significance, emptiness is the central theme of the artworks by the contemporary Australian artist [[David Booker]].

'''Everyday life''', '''daily life''' or '''routine life''' comprises the ways in which people typically act, think, and feel on a daily basis.  Everyday life may be described as mundane, routine, natural, habitual, or [[Normality (behavior)|normal]].

Human [[diurnality]] means most people sleep at least part of the night and are active in daytime. Most eat two or three meals in a day.  [[Working time]] (apart from [[shift work]]) mostly involves a daily schedule, beginning in the [[morning]].  This produces the daily [[rush hour]]s experienced by many millions, and the [[drive time]] focused on by radio broadcasters.  [[Evening]] is often [[leisure]] time. [[Bathing]] every day is a custom for many.

Beyond these broad similarities, lifestyles vary and different people spend their days differently. [[Nomad]]ic life differs from [[sedentism]], and among the sedentary, [[Urban area|urban]] people live differently from [[Rural area|rural]] folk. Differences in the lives of the [[wealth|rich]] and the [[poverty|poor]], or between [[factory worker]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[intellectual]]s, may go beyond their [[working hours]]. Many women spend their day in activities greatly different from those of men, and everywhere [[children]] do different things than adults.

==Sociological perspectives==
[[File:The Psychopathology of Everyday Life.jpg|thumb|''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'']]

Everyday life is a key concept in [[cultural studies]] and is a specialized subject in the field of [[sociology]].  Some argue that, motivated by [[capitalism]] and [[industrialism]]'s degrading effects on human existence and perception, writers and artists of the 19th century turned more towards [[self-reflection]] and the portrayal of everyday life represented in their writings and art to a noticeably greater degree than in past works, for example [[Renaissance literature]]'s interest in [[hagiography]] and politics.&lt;ref name="felski"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Felski|first1=Rita|title=The Invention of Everyday Life|date=1999|publisher=Lawrence &amp; Wishart|location=London|isbn=9780853159018|pages=15–31|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~rf6d/felski.the-invention-of-everyday-life.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--page 16--&gt;  Other theorists dispute this argument based on a long history of writings about daily life which can be seen in works from [[Ancient Greece]], [[Medieval art|medieval Christianity]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="lefebvre"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lefebvre|first1=Henri|title=Everyday life in the modern world|date=1984|publisher=Transaction Books|location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A.|isbn=978-0878559725|accessdate=15 November 2014|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coser|first1=[edited by] Lewis A.|title=The idea of social structure : papers in honor of Robert K. Merton|date=2012|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=978-1412847414|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of everyday life gender has been an important factor in its conceptions.  Some theorists regard [[women]] as the quintessential representatives and victims of everyday life.&lt;ref name="lefebvre"/&gt;&lt;!--page73--&gt;  

The connotation of everyday life is often negative and is distinctively separated from exceptional moments by its lack of [[distinction (sociology)|distinction]] and differentiation, ultimately defined as the essential, taken-for-granted continuum of [[mundane]] activity that outlines forays into more [[esoteric]] experiences.  It is the non-negotiable [[reality]] that exists amongst all social groupings without discrimination and is an unavoidable basis for which all human endeavor exists.&lt;ref name="felski" /&gt;

Much of everyday life is automatic in that it is driven by current environmental features as mediated by automatic [[cognitive processing]] of those features, and without any mediation by conscious choice, according to social psychologist [[John Bargh|John A. Bargh]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyer/Bargh 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Daily life is also studied by sociologists to investigate how it is organised and given meaning. A sociological journal called the ''[[Journal of Mundane Behavior]]'', published 2000 - 2004, studied these everyday actions.

== Leisure ==
{{Main|Leisure}}

Daily [[entertainment]] once consisted mainly of telling stories in the evening. This [[Convention (norm)|custom]] developed into the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] and other professional entertainments. [[Reading (process)|Reading]] later became less a mysterious specialty of [[scholar]]s, and more a common pleasure for people who could afford books. During the 20th century [[mass media]] became prevalent in rich countries, creating among other things a daily [[prime time]] to consume [[fiction]] and other professionally produced works.

Different media forms serve different purposes in different individuals' everyday lives—which give people the opportunities to make [[choice]]s about what media form(s)--watching [[television]], using the [[Internet]], listening to the [[radio]], or reading newspapers or magazines—most effectively help them to accomplish their tasks.&lt;ref name="Baym"&gt;Baym, N. (2010), ‘Making New Media Make Sense’ in Personal Connections in the Digital Age, Polity Press, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many people have steadily increased their daily use of the Internet, over all other media forms.   Fearing changes promoted by mass entertainment, [[social conservative]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have long censored books and films, called television a [[vast wasteland]], and predicted that [[social media]] and other Internet sites would distract people from good [[personal relationship]]s or valuable interactions.  These concerns did not prevent the progressively wider popularity of these innovations.

==Language==
People's everyday lives are shaped through [[language]] and [[communication]]. They choose what to do with their time based on opinions and ideals formed through the [[discourse]] they are exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Silverstone (1994), Television and Everyday Life, p. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the dialogue people are subject to comes from the [[mass media]], which is an important factor in what shapes [[human experience]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie Gillepsie and Eugene McLaughlin (2008), Media and the Shaping of Public Attitudes, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The media uses language to make an impact on one’s everyday life, whether that be as small as helping to decide where to eat or as big as choosing a [[Representative democracy|representative]] in government.

To improve people's everyday life, Phaedra Pezzullo, professor in the Department of Communication and Culture at [[Indiana University Bloomington]], says people should seek to understand the [[rhetoric]] that so often and unnoticeably changes their lives. She writes that “...rhetoric enables us to make connections... It's about understanding how we engage with the world.”&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rosdeitcher (2006), "[http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v29n1/rhetoric.shtml The Rhetoric of Everyday Life]", ''Humanities, Then and Now'' 29, no. 1 (Fall).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities of Daily Living==

[[Activities of daily living]] (ADL) is a term used in healthcare to refer to daily [[self care]] activities within an individual's place of residence, in outdoor environments, or both. [[Health professional]]s routinely refer to the ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regard to people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and the [[Old age|elderly]].&lt;ref name=EN&gt;"Activities of Daily Living Evaluation." ''Encyclopedia of Nursing &amp; Allied Health''. ed.

'''Fertilisation''' or '''fertilization''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|spelling differences]]), also known as '''generative fertilisation''', '''insemination''', '''pollination''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fertilization |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilization |website=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''fecundation''', '''syngamy''' and '''impregnation''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/impregnation{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the fusion of [[gametes]] to initiate the development of a new individual [[organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{], or outside ([[external fertilization|external fertilisation]])&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called [[sexual reproduction]]. During double fertilisation in angiosperms the haploid male gamete combines with two haploid polar nuclei to      form a triploid primary endosperm nucleus by the process of vegetative fertilisation.

==History==
In Antiquity, [[Aristotle]] conceived the formation of new individuals through fusion of male and female fluids, with form and function emerging gradually, in a mode called by him as [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenetic]].&lt;ref name=Maienschein&gt;Maienschein J. 2017. The first century of cell theory: From structural units to complex living systems. In: Stadler F. (eds.), ''Integrated History and Philosophy of Science. Vienna Circle Institute Yearbook''. Institute Vienna Circle, University of Vienna, Vienna Circle Society, Society for the Advancement of Scientific World Conceptions, vol 20. Springer, Cham. [https://books.google.com.br/books?id=zRgnDwAAQBAJ link].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784, [[Spallanzani]] established the need of interaction between the female's ovum and male's sperm to form a zygote in frogs.&lt;ref name=Birkhead/&gt; In 1827, von Baer observed a mammalian egg for the first time.&lt;ref name=Maienschein/&gt; [[Oscar Hertwig]] (1876), in Germany, described the fusion of nuclei of spermatozoa and of ova from [[sea urchin]].&lt;ref name="Birkhead"&gt;Birkhead, T.R. &amp; Montgomerie, R. (2009). Three centuries of sperm research, pp 1-42 in: Birkhead, T. R., Hosken, D. J. &amp; Pitnick, S. ''Sperm Biology: An Evolutionary Perspective''. Elsevier/Academic Press, Amsterdam. 642 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kctYNbO1fE0C].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The evolution of fertilisation is related to the [[Origin and function of meiosis|origin of meiosis]], as both are part of [[sexual reproduction]], originated in [[eukaryote]]s. There are two conflicting theories on how the couple meiosis–fertilisation arose. One is that it evolved from prokaryotic sex ([[bacterial recombination]]) as eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_2011"&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair | first1 = Harris | last1 = Bernstein | first2 = Carol | last2 = Bernstein   | first3 = Richard E. | last3 = Michou | name-list-format = vanc  | editor-first1 = Inna | editor-last1 = Kruman | title = DNA repair | chapter = Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair | year = 2011 | publisher = InTech | doi = 10.5772/1751|isbn=978-953-307-697-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is that [[mitosis]] originated meiosis.&lt;ref name="Wilkins_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkins AS, Holliday R | title = The evolution of meiosis from mitosis | journal = Genetics | volume = 181 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19139151 | pmc = 2621177 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.108.099762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fertilisation in plants==
[[File:DEV035048A.jpg|thumb|In the [[Bryophyte]] land plants, fertilisation takes place within the [[archegonium]]. This [[moss]] has been [[GUS reporter system|genetically modified]] so that the unfertilised egg within the archegonium produces a blue colour.]]&lt;p&gt;The gametes that participate in fertilisation of plants are the pollen (male), and the egg (female) cell.  Various families of plants have differing methods by which the female gametophyte is fertilized.  In [[Bryophyte]] land plants, fertilisation takes place within the [[archegonium]].  In [[Flowering plant|flowering plants]] a second fertilisation event involves another sperm cell and the [[central cell]] which is a second female gamete. In flowering plants there are two sperm from each pollen grain.&lt;/p&gt;In [[Seed plant|seed plants]], after [[pollination]], a [[pollen]] grain [[Pollen germination|germinates]], and a [[pollen tube]] grows and penetrates the [[ovule]] through a tiny pore called a [[Ovule|micropyle]]. The sperm are transferred from the pollen through the pollen tube to the ovule.

'''Pollen tube growth'''

Unlike animal sperm which is motile, plant sperm is immotile and relies on the pollen tube to carry it to the ovule where the sperm is released.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms4129 |title=Reactive oxygen species mediate pollen tube rupture to release sperm for fertilization in Arabidopsis |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |year=2014 |last1=Duan |first1=Qiaohong |last2=Kita |first2=Daniel |last3=Johnson |first3=Eric A |last4=Aggarwal |first4=Mini |last5=Gates |first5=Laura |last6=Wu |first6=Hen-Ming |last7=Cheung |first7=Alice Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pollen tube penetrates the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] and elongates through the extracellular matrix of the style before reaching the ovary.  Then near the receptacle, it breaks through the [[ovule]] through the micropyle (an opening in the ovule wall) and the pollen tube "bursts" into the embryo sac, releasing sperm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90427-1 |pmid=7634328 |title=A floral transmitting tissue-specific glycoprotein attracts pollen tubes and stimulates their growth |journal=Cell |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=383–93 |year=1995 |last1=Cheung |first1=Alice Y |last2=Wang |first2=Hong |last3=Wu |first3=Hen-Ming }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of the pollen tube has been believed to depend on chemical cues from the pistil, however these mechanisms were poorly understood until 1995.  Work done on [[Nicotiana|tobacco plants]] revealed a family of [[Glycoprotein|glycoproteins]] called TTS proteins that enhanced growth of pollen tubes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Pollen tubes in a sugar free pollen germination medium and a medium with purified TTS proteins both grew.  However, in the TTS medium, the tubes grew at a rate 3x that of the sugar-free medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  TTS proteins were also placed on various locations of semi [[In vivo|in vevo]] pollinated pistils, and pollen tubes were observed to immediately extend toward the proteins.  Transgenic plants lacking the ability to produce TTS proteins exhibited slower pollen tube growth and reduced fertility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Rupture of pollen tube'''

The rupture of the pollen tube to release sperm in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' has been shown to depend on a signal from the female gametophyte.  Specific proteins called FER protein kinases present in the ovule control the production of highly reactive derivatives of oxygen called [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/reactive-oxygen-species|title=Reactive oxygen species|last=Maejima|first=Yasuhiro|date=2012|website=Science Direct|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ROS levels have been shown via [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] to be at their highest during floral stages when the ovule is the most receptive to pollen tubes, and lowest during times of development and following fertilization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    High amounts of ROS activate Calcium ion channels in the pollen tube, causing these channels to take up Calcium ions in large amounts. This increased uptake of calcium causes the pollen tube to rupture, and release its sperm into the ovule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Pistil feeding assays in which plants were fed diphenyl iodonium chloride (DPI) suppressed ROS concentrations in ''Arabidopsis'', which in turn prevented pollen tube rupture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
===Bryophytes===
Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that do not have true vascular tissue and are therefore called "non-vascular plants". Some bryophytes do have specialised tissues for the transport of water; however, since these do not contain lignin, they are not considered true vascular tissue.
{{empty section|date=January 2015}}

===Ferns===
A fern is a member of a group of roughly 12,000 species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular (i.e. having water-conducting vessels). They have stems and leaves, like other vascular plants. Most ferns have what are called fiddleheads that expand into fronds, which are each delicately divided.
{{empty section|date=January 2015}}

===Gymnosperms===
The gymnosperms are a group of seed producing plants that includes conifers, [[Cycad]]s, [[Ginkgo]], and [[Gnetales]]. The term "gymnosperm" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, "naked" and σπέρμα sperma, "seed"), meaning "naked seeds", after the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilised state). Their naked condition stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, often modified to form cones, or at the end of short stalks as in Ginkgo.

===Flowering plants===
{{main article|Double fertilisation}}

After being fertilised, the ovary starts to swell and develop into the [[fruit]].&lt;ref name="facts_and_practice_for_a_level"&gt;{{cite book  |last1=Johnstone |first1=Adam |title=Biology: facts &amp; practice for A level |date= |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=  |isbn=0-19-914766-3 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; With multi-seeded fruits, multiple grains of pollen are necessary for syngamy with each ovule.  The growth of the pollen tube is controlled by the vegetative (or tube) cytoplasm. Hydrolytic [[enzymes]] are secreted by the pollen tube that digest the female tissue as the tube grows down the stigma and style; the digested tissue is used as a nutrient source for the pollen tube as it grows. During pollen tube growth towards the ovary, the generative nucleus divides to produce two separate sperm nuclei (haploid number of chromosomes)&lt;ref name="handbook_of_plant_science"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of plant science |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England |isbn=978-0-470-05723-0 |page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a growing pollen tube therefore contains three separate nuclei, two sperm and one tube.&lt;ref name="biology_today_a01"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=David |last2=Starr |first2=Cecie |title=Biology today |year=1975 |publisher=CRM |location=Del Mar, Calif. |isbn=978-0-394-31093-0 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sperms are interconnected and dimorphic, the large one, in a number of plants, is also linked to the tube nucleus and the interconnected sperm and the tube nucleus form the "male germ unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raghavan |first1=Valayamghat |title=Double fertilization: embryo and endosperm development in flowering plant |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-540-27791-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Double fertilization|Double fertilisation]] is the process in [[angiosperms]] (flowering plants) in which two [[sperm]] from each pollen tube fertilise two [[cell (biology)|cells]] in a female [[gametophyte]] (sometimes called an embryo sac) that is inside an ovule. After the pollen tube enters the gametophyte, the pollen tube nucleus disintegrates and the two sperm cells are released; one of the two sperm cells ''fertilises'' the egg cell (at the bottom of the gametophyte near the micropyle), forming a [[diploid]] (2n) [[zygote]]. This is the point when fertilisation actually occurs; pollination and fertilisation are two separate processes. The nucleus of the other sperm cell fuses with two haploid polar nuclei (contained in the central cell) in the centre of the gametophyte. The resulting cell is [[triploid]] (3n). This triploid cell divides through [[mitosis]] and forms the [[endosperm]], a [[nutrient]]-rich [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], inside the [[seed]].

The two central-cell maternal nuclei (polar nuclei) that contribute to the endosperm arise by mitosis from the single meiotic product that also gave rise to the egg. Therefore, maternal contribution to the genetic constitution of the triploid endosperm is double that of the embryo.

One primitive species of flowering plant, ''[[Nuphar|Nuphar polysepala]]'', has endosperm that is diploid, resulting from the fusion of a sperm with one, rather than two, maternal nuclei. It is believed that early in the development of angiosperm linages, there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction, producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes, and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio.&lt;ref name=Friedman2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00257.x |pmid=12683519 |title=Modularity of the Angiosperm Female Gametophyte and Its Bearing on the Early Evolution of Endosperm in Flowering Plants |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=216–30 |year=2003 |last1=Friedman |first1=William E |last2=Williams |first2=Joseph H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many plants, the development of the flesh of the fruit is proportional to the percentage of fertilised ovules. For example, with [[watermelon]], about a thousand grains of pollen must be delivered and spread evenly on the three lobes of the stigma to make a normal sized and shaped fruit.

Cross-fertilisation and self-fertilisation represent different strategies with differing benefits and costs.  An estimated 48.7% of plant species are either dioecious or self-incompatible obligate out-crossers.&lt;ref name="pmid16817548"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Igic B, Kohn JR |title=The distribution of plant mating systems: study bias against obligately outcrossing species |journal=Evolution |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=1098–103 |year=2006 |pmid=16817548 |doi= 10.1554/05-383.1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also estimated that about 42% of flowering plants exhibit a mixed mating system in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodwillie C, Kalisz S, Eckert CG | year = 2005 | title = The evolutionary enigma of mixed mating systems in plants: Occurrence, theoretical explanations, and empirical evidence | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 47–79 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.091704.175539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most common kind of mixed mating system, individual plants produce a single type of flower and fruits may contain self-fertilised, out-crossed or a mixture of progeny types.  The transition from cross-fertilisation to self-fertilisation is the most common evolutionary transition in plants, and has occurred repeatedly in many independent lineages.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0133 |pmid=23595268 |pmc=3652455 |title=Evolutionary consequences of self-fertilization in plants |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=280 |issue=1760 |pages=20130133 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=S. I |last2=Kalisz |first2=S |last3=Slotte |first3=T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 10-15% of flowering plants are predominantly self-fertilising.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268" /&gt;

===Self-Pollination===
{{main article|Self-pollination}}{{see also|Cleistogamy|Autogamy}}
Under circumstances where [[pollinator]]s and/or mates are rare, self-fertilisation offers the advantage of [[Reproductive success|reproductive assurance]].&lt;ref name="pmid23595268" /&gt;  Self-fertilisation can therefore result in improved colonisation ability. In some species, self-fertilisation has persisted over many generations.  ''[[Capsella rubella]]'' is a self-fertilisating species that became self-compatible 50,000 to 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid24068948"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003754 |pmid=24068948 |pmc=3772084 |title=Genomic Identification of Founding Haplotypes Reveals the History of the Selfing Species Capsella rubella |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=e1003754 |year=2013 |last1=Brandvain |first1=Yaniv |last2=Slotte |first2=Tanja |last3=Hazzouri |first3=Khaled M |last4=Wright |first4=Stephen I |last5=Coop |first5=Graham }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a predominantly self-fertilising plant with an [[Allogamy|out-crossing]] rate in the wild of less than 0.3%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = RJ | last2 = Gomes | first2 = MF | year = 1989 | title = Population genetic structure and outcrossing rate of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh | url = | journal = Heredity | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 411–418 | doi=10.1038/hdy.1989.56}}&lt;/ref&gt; a study suggested that self-fertilisation evolved roughly a million years ago or more in ''A. thaliana''.&lt;ref name="pmid17656687"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang C, Toomajian C, Sherman-Broyles S, Plagnol V, Guo YL, Hu TT, Clark RM, Nasrallah JB, Weigel D, Nordborg M |title=The evolution of selfing in Arabidopsis thaliana |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5841 |pages=1070–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17656687 |doi=10.1126/science.1143153 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In long-established self-fertilising plants, the masking of deleterious [[mutation]]s and the production of genetic variability is infrequent and thus unlikely to provide a sufficient benefit over many generations to maintain the meiotic apparatus.  Consequently, one might expect self-fertilisation to be replaced in nature by an ameiotic asexual form of reproduction that would be less costly.  However the actual persistence of meiosis and self-fertilisation as a form of reproduction in long-established self-fertilising plants may be related to the immediate benefit of efficient [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|recombinational repair]] of DNA damage during formation of germ cells provided by meiosis at each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.5772/25117 |doi-access=free |chapter=Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair |title=DNA Repair |year=2011 |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Bernstein |first2=Carol |last3=Michod |first3=Richard E. |editor-first=Inna |editor-last=Kruman |isbn=978-953-307-697-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fertilisation in animals ==
{{see also|Sexual reproduction in animals|Animal sexual behaviour}}
The mechanics behind fertilisation has been studied extensively in sea urchins and mice.  This research addresses the question of how the [[spermatozoon|sperm]] and the appropriate egg find each other and the question of how only one sperm gets into the egg and delivers its contents. There are three steps to fertilisation that ensure species-specificity:

# Chemotaxis
# Sperm activation/acrosomal reaction
# Sperm/egg adhesion

=== Internal vs. external ===
Consideration as to whether an animal (more specifically a vertebrate) uses [[Internal fertilization|internal]] or [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] is often dependent on the method of birth. Oviparous animals laying eggs with thick calcium shells, such as [[chickens]], or thick leathery shells generally reproduce via internal fertilisation so that the sperm fertilises the egg without having to pass through the thick, protective, tertiary layer of the egg. [[Ovoviviparity|Ovoviviparous]] and [[viviparity|viviparous]] animals also use internal fertilisation. It is important to note that although some organisms reproduce via [[amplexus]], they may still use internal fertilisation, as with some salamanders. Advantages to internal fertilisation include: minimal waste of gametes; greater chance of individual egg fertilisation, relatively "longer" time period of egg protection, and selective fertilisation; many females have the ability to store sperm for extended periods of time and can fertilise their eggs at their own desire.

Oviparous animals producing eggs with thin tertiary membranes or no membranes at all, on the other hand, use external fertilisation methods. Advantages to external fertilisation include: minimal contact and transmission of bodily fluids; decreasing the risk of disease transmission, and greater genetic variation (especially during broadcast spawning external fertilisation methods).

=== Sea urchins ===
[[File:Acrosome reaction diagram en.svg|thumb|400px|Acrosome reaction on a sea urchin cell.]]

Sperm find the eggs via [[chemotaxis]], a type of ligand/receptor interaction. Resact is a 14 amino acid peptide purified from the jelly coat of ''A. punctulata'' that attracts the migration of sperm.

After finding the egg, the sperm penetrates the [[egg jelly|jelly coat]] through a process called sperm activation. In another ligand/receptor interaction, an oligosaccharide component of the egg binds and activates a receptor on the sperm and causes the [[acrosomal reaction]]. The acrosomal vesicles of the sperm fuse with the plasma membrane and are released. In this process, molecules bound to the acrosomal vesicle membrane, such as bindin, are exposed on the surface of the sperm.  These contents digest the jelly coat and eventually the vitelline membrane. In addition to the release of acrosomal vesicles, there is explosive polymerisation of [[actin]] to form a thin spike at the head of the sperm called the [[acrosomal process]].

The sperm binds to the egg through another ligand reaction between receptors on the [[vitelline membrane]]. The sperm surface protein bindin, binds to a receptor on the vitelline membrane identified as EBR1.

Fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg are likely mediated by bindin. At the site of contact, fusion causes the formation of a [[fertilization cone|fertilisation cone]].

=== Mammals ===
[[Mammal]]s internally fertilise through [[copulation]]. After a male [[male ejaculation|ejaculates]], many sperm move to the upper vagina (via contractions from the vagina) through the [[cervix]] and across the length of the [[uterus]] to meet the ovum. In cases where fertilisation occurs, the female usually [[ovulation|ovulates]] during a period that extends from hours before copulation to a few days after; therefore, in most mammals it is more common for ejaculation to precede ovulation than vice versa.

The [[capacitation|capacitated]] spermatozoon and the oocyte meet and interact in the ''ampulla'' of the [[fallopian tube]]. Rheotaxis, thermotaixs and chemotaxis are known mechanisms in guiding sperm towards the egg during the final stage of sperm migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1530/JOE-16-0302 |pmid=27875265 |title=Oviduct: Roles in fertilization and early embryo development |journal=Journal of Endocrinology |volume=232 |issue=1 |pages=R1–R26 |year=2016 |last1=Li |first1=Shuai |last2=Winuthayanon |first2=Wipawee }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spermatozoa respond (see [[Sperm thermotaxis]]) to the temperature gradient of ~2&amp;nbsp;°C between the oviduct and the ampulla,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mce.2006.03.027 |pmid=16672171 |title=Sperm thermotaxis |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |volume=252 |issue=1–2 |pages=115–9 |year=2006 |last1=Bahat |first1=Anat |last2=Eisenbach |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chemotaxis#Eukaryotic chemotaxis|chemotactic]] gradients of [[progesterone]] have been confirmed as the signal emanating from the [[cumulus oophorus]] cells surrounding rabbit and human oocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0008211 |pmid=19997608 |pmc=2782141 |title=Molecular Mechanism for Human Sperm Chemotaxis Mediated by Progesterone |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=e8211 |year=2009 |last1=Teves |first1=Maria E |last2=Guidobaldi |first2=Hector A |last3=Uñates |first3=Diego R |last4=Sanchez |first4=Raul |last5=Miska |first5=Werner |last6=Publicover |first6=Stephen J |last7=Morales Garcia |first7=Aduén A |last8=Giojalas |first8=Laura C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacitated and hyperactivated sperm respond to these gradients by changing their behaviour and moving towards the cumulus-oocyte complex. Other chemotactic signals such as formyl Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) may also guide spermatozoa.&lt;ref name=Gnessi1986&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Gnessi L, Fabbri A, Silvestroni L, Moretti C, Fraioli F, Pert CB, Isidori A | year = 1986 | title = Evidence for the presence of specific receptors for N-formyl chemotactic peptides on human spermatozoa| journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab| volume = 63| pages = 841–846| pmid =3018025 |doi = 10.1210/jcem-63-4-841| url = | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[zona pellucida]], a thick layer of extracellular matrix that surrounds the egg and is similar to the role of the vitelline membrane in sea urchins, binds with the sperm. Unlike sea urchins, the sperm binds to the egg before the acrosomal reaction. [[ZP3]], a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida, is responsible for egg/sperm adhesion in mice. The receptor [[galactosyltransferase]] (GalT) binds to the N-acetylglucosamine residues on the ZP3 and is important for binding with the sperm and activating the acrosome reaction. ZP3 is sufficient though unnecessary for sperm/egg binding. Two additional sperm receptors exist: a 250kD protein that binds to an oviduct secreted protein, and SED1, which independently binds to the zona.  After the acrosome reaction, the sperm is believed to remain bound to the zona pellucida through exposed ZP2 receptors. These receptors are unknown in mice but have been identified in guinea pigs.

In mammals, the binding of the spermatozoon to the GalT initiates the [[acrosome reaction]]. This process releases the [[hyaluronidase]] that digests the matrix of [[hyaluronic acid]] in the vestments around the oocyte.  Fusion between the oocyte [[plasma membrane]]s and sperm follows and allows the sperm [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], the typical [[centriole]], and atypical [[centriole]] that is attached to the [[flagellum]], but not the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], to enter the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-04678-8 |title=A novel atypical sperm centriole is functional during human fertilization |journal=Nature Communications |volume=9 |year=2018 |last1=Fishman |first1=Emily L |last2=Jo |first2=Kyoung |last3=Nguyen |first3=Quynh P.

The egg "[[egg activation|activates]]" itself upon fusing with a single sperm cell and thereby changes its cell membrane to prevent fusion with other sperm. [[Zinc]] atoms are released during this activation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/human-eggs-spark-moment-fertilization{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Commons|Fertilization#Mammalian fertilization|Mammalian fertilization}}
This process ultimately leads to the formation of a [[diploid]] cell called a [[zygote]].  The zygote divides to form a [[blastocyst]] and, upon entering the uterus, [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the endometrium, beginning [[pregnancy]]. Embryonic implantation not in the [[uterus|uterine]] wall results in an [[ectopic pregnancy]] that can kill the mother.


In such animals as rabbits, coitus induces ovulation by stimulating the release of the pituitary hormone gonadotropin; this release greatly increases the likelihood of pregnancy.

==== Humans ====
[[File:Human Fertilization.png|thumb|Fertilisation in humans. The sperm and ovum unite through fertilisation, creating a zygote that (over the course of 8-9 days) implants in the uterine wall, where it resides for nine months.]]
{{main article|Human fertilisation}}

The term ''conception'' commonly refers to fertilisation, which is the successful fusion of gametes to form a new organism.  Its use 'conception' by some to refer to implantation makes it a subject of [[beginning of pregnancy controversy|semantic arguments about the beginning of pregnancy]], typically in the context of the [[abortion]] debate.
&lt;!-- In a statement by the [[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]] (AAPLOG), regarding the controversial [[morning-after pill]], AAPLOG claims:--&gt;
&lt;!-- NOTE: This is a quote for a developing section, if you have a problem with it, hide the text (like this text is) but don't remove it, until I can rework it. Sinreg, --&gt;
&lt;!--:"[Again,] one must be careful of the terminology. Many now speak of "conception" as that moment when the human blastocyst, the early ball of approximately 100 cells, implants in the mother’s uterus (womb).  The time from actual fertilisation (egg and sperm unite in the Fallopian Tube) until implantation, a period of about 7-10 days, is ignored, even though no genetic change occurs in the cells during this time period.  Many family planning specialists who have supported the terminology change can thus rationalize that the destruction of the human embryo between fertilisation and implantation should be labeled "contraception", rather than "early abortion".--&gt;
Upon [[gastrulation]], which occurs around 16 days after fertilisation, the implanted blastocyst develops three germ layers, the endoderm, the ectoderm and the mesoderm, and the genetic code of the father becomes fully involved in the development of the embryo; later twinning is impossible.  Additionally, interspecies hybrids survive only until gastrulation and cannot further develop.
However, some human developmental biology literature refers to the ''[[conceptus]]'' and such medical literature refers to the "products of conception" as the post-implantation embryo and its surrounding membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Moore, K. L.  |author2=T. V. M. Persaud |year=2003 |title=The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology |publisher=W. B. Saunders Company |isbn=0-7216-6974-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "conception" is not usually used in scientific literature because of its variable definition and connotation.

=== Insects ===
[[File:Voo nupcial detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Red-veined darters (''[[Sympetrum fonscolombii]]'') flying "in cop" (male ahead), enabling the male to prevent other males from mating. The eggs are fertilised as they are laid, one at a time.]]
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}&lt;!--at least cover dragonflies, bees--&gt;

Insects in different groups, including the [[Odonata]] ([[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]]) and the [[Hymenoptera]] ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s) practise delayed fertilisation. Anong the Odonata, females may mate with multiple males, and store sperm until the eggs are laid. The male may hover above the female during egg-laying (oviposition) to prevent her from mating with other males and replacing his sperm; in some groups such as the darters, the male continues to grasp the female with his claspers during egg-laying, the pair flying around in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dijkstra |first=Klaas-Douwe B. |title=Field Guide to the Dragonflies of Britain and Europe |year=2006 |publisher=British Wildlife Publishing |isbn=0-9531399-4-8|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among social Hymenoptera, [[honeybee]] queens mate only on mating flights, in a short period lasting some days; a queen may mate with eight or more [[drone (bee)|drones]]. She then stores the sperm for the rest of her life, perhaps for five years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waldbauer |first1=Gilbert |title=The Birder's Bug Book|date=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agriculture and Consumer Protection|title=Beekeeping in Africa: Colony life and social organization|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0104e/t0104e05.htm|publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--other bees ...--&gt;

==Fertilisation in fungi==
In many [[fungi]] (except [[chytrid]]s), as in some protists, fertilisation is a two step process. First, the cytoplasms of the two gamete cells fuse (called [[plasmogamy]]), producing a [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] or [[Heterokaryon|heterokaryotic]] cell with multiple nuclei. This cell may then divide to produce dikaryotic or heterokaryotic [[hyphae]]. The second step of fertilisation is [[karyogamy]], the fusion of the nuclei to form a diploid zygote.

In [[chytrid]] fungi, fertilisation occurs in a single step with the fusion of gametes, as in animals and plants.

==Fertilisation in protists==

===Fertilisation in protozoa===
There are three types of fertilisation processes in protozoa:&lt;ref&gt;''Fertilization in protozoa and metazoan animals: cellular and molecular aspects.'' Juan J. Tarín; Antonio Cano (eds.). Springer-Verlag, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* gametogamy;
* autogamy;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reproduction#Autogamy]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44777/autogamy{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* gamontogamy.

===Fertilisation in algae===
Fertilisation in algae occurs by [[binary fission]]. The [[pseudopodia]] is first withdrawn and the nucleus starts dividing. When the cytoplasm is divided, the cytoplasm is also divided into two equal parts for each daughter cell. Two daughter cells are produced by one parent cell. It involves the process of [[mitosis]].{{empty section|date=September 2015}}

===Fertilisation in fungi-like protists===
{{empty section|date=March 2015}}

== Fertilisation and genetic recombination ==
[[Meiosis]] results in a random segregation of the genes that each parent contributes. Each parent organism is usually identical save for a fraction of their genes; each [[gamete]] is therefore genetically unique.  At fertilisation, parental [[chromosome]]s combine. In [[human]]s, (2²²)² = 17.6x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; chromosomally different [[zygote]]s are possible for the non-sex chromosomes, even assuming no [[chromosomal crossover]].  If crossover occurs once, then on average (4²²)² = 309x10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; genetically different zygotes are possible for every couple, not considering that crossover events can take place at most points along each chromosome.  The X and Y chromosomes undergo no crossover events{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and are therefore excluded from the calculation.  The [[mitochondrial DNA]] is only inherited from the maternal parent.

==Parthenogenesis==
{{main article|parthenogenesis}}
Organisms that normally reproduce sexually can also reproduce via [[parthenogenesis]], wherein an unfertilised female gamete produces viable offspring. These offspring may be clones of the mother, or in some cases genetically differ from her but inherit only part of her DNA. Parthenogenesis occurs in many plants and animals and may be induced in others through a chemical or electrical stimulus to the egg cell. In 2004, Japanese researchers led by [[Tomohiro Kono]] succeeded after 457 attempts to merge the [[ovum|ova]] of two mice by blocking certain proteins that would normally prevent the possibility; the resulting embryo normally developed into a mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature02402 |pmid=15103378 |laysummary=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0421_040421_whoneedsmales.html |laysource=National Geographic |laydate=2004-04-21 |title=Birth of parthenogenetic mice that can develop to adulthood |journal=Nature |volume=428 |issue=6985 |pages=860–4 |year=2004 |last1=Kono |first1=Tomohiro |last2=Obata |first2=Yayoi |last3=Wu |first3=Quiong |last4=Niwa |first4=Katsutoshi |last5=Ono |first5=Yukiko |last6=Yamamoto |first6=Yuji |last7=Park |first7=Eun Sung |last8=Seo |first8=Jeong-Sun |last9=Ogawa |first9=Hidehiko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allogamy and autogamy==
[[Allogamy]], which is also known as cross-fertilisation, refers to the fertilisation of an egg cell from one individual with the male gamete of another.

Autogamy which is also known as self-fertilisation, occurs in such hermaphroditic organisms as plants and flatworms; therein, two gametes from one individual fuse.

==Other variants of bisexual reproduction==

Some relatively unusual forms of reproduction are:&lt;ref name=Stenberg2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000351731 |pmid=23796636 |title=Meiosis and Its Deviations in Polyploid Animals |journal=Cytogenetic and Genome Research |volume=140 |issue=2–4 |pages=185 |year=2013 |last1=Stenberg |first1=P |last2=Saura |first2=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1738 |title=Simultaneous Mendelian and clonal genome transmission in a sexually reproducing, all-triploid vertebrate |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=279 |issue=1732 |pages=1293 |year=2011 |last1=Stock |first1=M |last2=Ustinova |first2=J |last3=Betto-Colliard |first3=C |last4=Schartl |first4=M |last5=Moritz |first5=C |last6=Perrin |first6=N |pmc=3282369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gynogenesis]]: A sperm stimulates the egg to develop without fertilisation or syngamy. The sperm may enter the egg.

[[Hybridogenesis]]: One genome is eliminated to produce haploid eggs.

[[Canina meiosis]]: (sometimes called "permanent odd polyploidy") one genome is transmitted in the Mendelian fashion, others are transmitted clonally.

==Benefits of cross-fertilisation==
{{main article|Allogamy|Heterosis}}
The major benefit of cross-fertilisation is generally thought to be the avoidance of [[inbreeding depression]]. [[Charles Darwin]], in his 1876 book ''[[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'' (pages 466-467) summed up his findings in the following way.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin CR (1876).  The effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom. London: John Murray. http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1881-Worms-CrossandSelfFertilisation-F1249/1876-F1249.html see page 466-467&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“It has been shown in the present volume that the offspring from the union of two distinct individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have an immense advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigour and fertility over the self-fertilised offspring from one of the same parents. And this fact is amply sufficient to account for the development of the sexual elements, that is, for the genesis of the two sexes.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, it is thought by some,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BST0340519 |pmid=16856849 |title=Why have sex? The population genetics of sex and recombination |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=519–22 |year=2006 |last1=Otto |first1=S.P |last2=Gerstein |first2=A.C }}&lt;/ref&gt; that a long-term advantage of out-crossing in nature is increased genetic variability that promotes adaptation and/or avoidance of extinction (see [[Genetic variability]]).

'''Harald Olav Aabrekk''' (born 22 February 1956) is a Norwegian [[association football|football]] coach and a former player. He played for [[Sogndal Fotball|Sogndal]] and [[SK Brann|Brann]] in the [[Tippeligaen]], Norway's top professional football league. He has been head coach of Sogndal, [[Tromsø IL|Tromsø]], Brann, [[FK Haugesund|Haugesund]], [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]] and [[Aalesunds FK|Aalesund]],  and has also served as an assistant coach for the [[Norway national football team|Norwegian national football team]].

==Playing career==
Aabrekk made his debut for Sogndal in 1974 in the [[Norwegian Second Division]] (the third tier of Norwegian football).&lt;ref name="Sogndal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Alaget/Spelarstall/Spelarinfo/tabid/620/person/504/mid/1437/Default.aspx |title=Harald Aabrekk – Statistikk Sogndal |publisher=[[Sogndal Fotball]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenpå90talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |title=90-talet og Hardal Aabrekk |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208033129/http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Klubben/Historia/5HaraldAabrekkogstartenp%C3%A590talet/tabid/489/Default.aspx |archive-date=8 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a short spell at SK Brann, where he played a match in the [[Tippeligaen]] (the top division) in [[1978 Norwegian First Division|1978]],&lt;ref name="Brann"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brann.no/historie/spillerdatabase/spillerarkiv/harald-aabrekk/ |title=Statistics; Brann |publisher=[[SK Brann]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he played for Sogndal throughout his career and was a major contributor to their promotion to the [[Norwegian First Division]] in 1981. He scored Sogndal's first goal in that division, against [[Molde FK|Molde]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He played a total of 133 league games from 1973 to 1982, including 22 matches in the [[1982 Norwegian First Division|First Division in 1982]].&lt;ref name="Sogndal"/&gt;

==Coaching career==
Aabrekk started his coaching career in his home county, [[Sogn og Fjordane]], at lower-league clubs Eid, Sandane, and [[Stryn TIL|Stryn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk blir ny Sogndal-trener |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801042447/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-blir-ny-sogndal-trener/ |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sogndalfotball.no/Nyheter/Aktuelt/tabid/486/smid/1092/ArticleID/10197/reftab/360/t/Harald-Aabrekk-er-tilbake/Default.aspx |language=Norwegian |title=Harald Aabrekk er tilbake |publisher=Sogndal Fotball |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming head coach of Sogndal. In 1990, his first season with them, Sogndal was promoted to the Tippeligaen in spite of a 5–0 loss against [[Bryne FK|Bryne]] in their first home match.&lt;ref name="Sogndalhistorie"/&gt; He then served as head coach of Tromsø in the Tippeligaen from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |title=Trist redningsmann |first=Roy |last=Ellingsen |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917153008/http://fotball.bt.no/incoming/article115043.ece |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, during a match against [[FK Bodø/Glimt|Bodø/Glimt]], Aabrekk tried to stall for time by acting as if he were injured after he was run down by Bodø/Glimt's physiotherapist Truls Karlsen. Although uninjured, he was taken by ambulance to hospital.&lt;ref name="hospital"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2006/11/04/481856.html |language=Norwegian |title=Fotballens største skuespillere |work=[[Dagbladet]] |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Verdens Gang]]'', he excused his behavior by saying, "I felt I was lying on the ground a bit too long, and I did not dare to get up so I stayed on the ground. I lay there and was thinking, 'What's going on?' It was not planned, and it was definitely not very smart. I would rather call it a blackout." This episode, according to the Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'', was the third worst case of acting in the history of football.&lt;ref name="hospital"/&gt;

Aabrekk later worked for the [[Football Association of Norway]] as a coordinator for youth development in [[Western Norway]]. He also served as [[Nils Johan Semb]]'s assistant coach for the [[Norway national under-21 football team|Norwegian under-21 team]] from 1992 to 1998, and when Semb succeeded [[Egil Olsen]] as head coach of the [[Norway national football team|Norwegian national team]] in 1998, Aabrekk became assistant coach of the national senior team.&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; At the same time, he worked as [[Kjell Tennfjord]]'s assistant in Brann, and in the summer of 1998 he became their head coach.&lt;ref name="tilbake"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk tilbake i Brann |publisher=SK Brann |date= |accessdate=8 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222190913/http://www.brann.no/nyheter/aabrekk-tilbake-i-brann/ |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After leading Brann to the finals of the [[1999 Norwegian Football Cup|1999 Norwegian Cup]], where they lost 2–0 against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/1999/10/31/181874.html |language=Norwegian |title=Uten Aabrekk slokner Brann |work=Dagbladet |date=31 October 1999 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received a one-year leave of absence to work full-time as assistant coach of the national team during their preparations for the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] football championship. He resigned from his job at Brann without returning,&lt;ref name="tilbake"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aktuell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2007/11/25/519211.html |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk er aktuell for Brann |work=Dagbladet |first=Stian |last=Haraldsen |date=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Brann had already hired [[Teitur Thordarson]] as their head coach and offered Aabrekk a position in their youth department, a job Brann claimed it was impossible to combine with the position of assistant coach of the national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/norsk/artikkel.php?artid=3088968 |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk slutter i Brann |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Aabrekk joined Sogndal as Torbjørn Glomnes's assistant coach&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; and saved the team from [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]].&lt;ref name="tidenes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article215924.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Derfor er Aabrekk tidenes Sogndal-trener |work=Bergens Tidende |first=Mads |last=Bøyum |date=27 November 2011 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222130219/http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article215924.ece |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September 2002 Haugesund announced that Aabrekk would join them as head coach on 1 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/artikkel.php?artid=1491118 |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk tar over Haugesund |work=Verdens Gang |date=17 September 2002 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a match against [[IK Start|Start]] on 19 October 2003, Aabrekk told referee Bjørn Hansen that he was "bought and paid for" twice after Aabrekk was dismissed from the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/artikkel.php?artid=81222 |language=Norwegian |title= Sa dommeren var kjøpt og betalt |work=Verdens Gang |first=Dag |last=Langholm |date=20 October 2003 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at Haugesund until the end of the 2005 season,&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt; when he joined [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]]'s coaching staff along with Egil Olsen and [[Petter Myhre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siste.no/fotball/eliteserien/article1874056.ece |language=Norwegian |title=VIF forsterker trenerteamet |work=[[Avisenes Nyhetsbyrå]] |publisher=siste.no |date=18 December 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July 2007 Myhre resigned as head coach of Vålerenga and Aabrekk was appointed head coach as caretaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.aftenposten.no/eliteserien/article86380.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Helt og holdent mitt valg |work=[[Aftenposten]] |first=Helle |last=Skjervold |first2=Øyvind |last2=Nordli |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307132445/http://fotball.aftenposten.no/eliteserien/article86380.ece |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two wins and a draw in the next three matches, Vålerenga gave him the job until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/norsk/artikkel.php?artid=194855 |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk fortsetter som VIF-trener |work=Verdens Gang |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Aabrekk was hired by Brann as a scout.&lt;ref name="tilbake"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv2.no/sport/fotball/tippeligaen/aabrekk-blir-brannspeider-1751146.html |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk blir Brann-speider |work=[[TV 2 (Norway)]] |first=Sturla |last=Johannessen |date= |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway through the season, the club wanted Aabrekk and the assistant coach, Espen Steffensen, to switch jobs. Steffensen did not accept this and was fired, and Aabrekk became the new assistant coach of Brann,&lt;ref name="redningsmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2008/08/07/542882.html |language=Norwegian |title=Mjelde-assistent sparket i Brann |work=Dagbladet |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=7 August 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the wishes of head coach [[Mons Ivar Mjelde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article115097.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Dette er tredd ned over hodet på meg |work=Bergens Tidende |date=8 August 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922160549/http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article115097.ece |archivedate=22 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Brann's bad performances and local press criticism of the lack of cooperation between Mjelde and Aabrekk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2008/08/28/545015.html |language=Norwegian |title=Fortjener ikke å flytte kjegler for Aabrekk |work=Dagbladet |first=Sigve |last=Kvamme |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914180917/http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/2008/08/28/545015.html |archive-date=14 September 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mjelde announced on 7 October 2008 that he would resign as head coach at the end of the season. At the same time, the club announced that Aabrekk would return immediately to his job as scout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article119843.ece |title=Mjelde slutter i Brann |work=Bergens Tidende |language=Norwegian |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624022045/http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article119843.ece |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a position he kept until the contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article149156.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk ferdig i Brann |work=Bergens Tidende |first=Silje |last=Dyregrov |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903121621/http://fotball.bt.no/eliteserien/article149156.ece |archivedate=3 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aabrekk was then hired as head coach of his old club, Sogndal from 1 January 2010, succeeding Karl Oskar Emberland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/norsk/1-divisjon/artikkel.php?artid=573924 |language=Norwegian |title=Aabrekk ansatt som Sogndal-trener |work=Verdens Gang |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season there, the team won promotion to the Tippeligaen, and in the next they avoided relegation. Following the 2011 season, Aabrekk retired. In his last match, he was named "Best Sogndal coach ever".&lt;ref name="tidenes"/&gt;

Aabrekk was hired as manager for Aalesunds FK before the 2015 season, but sacked four matches into the season, when his club was last in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smp.no/100Sport/fotball/eliteserien/article527177.snd|title = Harald Aabrekk sparket som Aalesund-trener|date = 28 April 2015|accessdate = 28 April 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life''''' is a 2012 popular [[economics]] book by [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky]] and Edward Skidelsky. It was published initially by [[Other Press]] and later by [[Penguin Books]].

The book asks why Westerners work so many hours per week and lead lives that revolve around money, business and financial decisions in defiance of [[John Maynard Keynes]]' 1930 assertion&lt;ref&gt;[[Yale University]] http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that there would come a time (around 2015) when [[capitalism]] would be able to provide for all our needs and the work week would drop to 10 or even 5 hours.

The book (and Edward Skidelsky's writing generally&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]] https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/23/consumerism-good-life-economic-system&lt;/ref&gt;) looks into the idea of [[Eudaimonia|the good life]] and how capitalism may have been the key to it, but we have now lost sense of the good life as a priority.

The solutions offered to this problem are to "curb insatiability" and to consider a form of [[basic income]] for society.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Escapologist]] http://newescapologist.co.uk/2012/12/06/how-much-is-enough/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

"The over-all thrust of their polemic is a welcome call to reinvigorate society's ethical aspect and bring about the good life for everyone." —''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[The New Yorker]] http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/brieflynoted/2012/08/13/120813crbn_brieflynoted1&lt;/ref&gt;

"How Much Is Enough? is a delightful book. It addresses a Big Question without the jargon and obfuscation that pollutes so much philosophy. The prose is lucid, and all the relevant issues are raised and addressed." —''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444450004578002083763099910&lt;/ref&gt;

"The authors turn to historical fiction, philosophy, and political theory, drawing on Faust, Marx's critique of capitalism, and Aristotle's uses of wealth. Their conclusion that concepts like respect, friendship, and community are more likely to contribute to satisfaction and overall happiness than wealth makes for a fascinating, if cerebral, read."  —''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;ref&gt;Publishers Weekly http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59051-507-5&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Skidelskys move seamlessly from the abstract to the concrete; from philosophy to public policy." —''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Independent https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-the-week-how-much-is-enough-the-love-of-money-and-the-case-for-the-good-life-by-robert-skidelsky--edward-skidelsky-7917722.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Posner]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', disagreed with both the book's concept of leisure and its proposition that more leisure time would lead to overall personal betterment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Posner|first1=Richard|title=Working 9 to 12 ‘How Much Is Enough?’ by Robert Skidelsky and Edward Skidelsky|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/books/review/how-much-is-enough-by-robert-skidelsky-and-edward-skidelsky.html|accessdate=31 July 2015|work=NY Times|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], '''inherent chirality''' is a property of asymmetry in molecules arising, not from a stereogenic or chiral center, but from a twisting of the molecule in 3-D space.   The term was first coined by Volker Boehmer in a 1994 review, to describe the chirality of [[calixarenes]] arising from their non-planar structure in 3-D space.

This phenomena was described as resulting from “the absence of a place of symmetry or an inversion center in the molecule as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalla Cort|first=Antonella|last2=Mandolini|first2=Luigi|last3=Pasquini|first3=Chiara|last4=Schiaffino|first4=Luca|date=2004-10-01|title="Inherent chirality" and curvature|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=B404388J|journal=New J.

== History ==

=== Calixarenes ===
After creating a series of traditionally chiral calixarenes (through the addition of a chiral substituent group on the top or bottom rim of the macrocycle,) the first inherently chiral calixarenes were synthesized in 1982, though the molecules were not yet described as such.  The inherently chiral calixarenes featured an XXYZ or WXYZ substitution pattern, such that the planar representation of the molecule does not show any chirality, and if the macrocycle were to be broken open, this would produce an achiral linear molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Shao-Yong|last2=Xu|first2=Yao-Wei|last3=Liu|first3=Jun-Min|last4=Su|first4=Cheng-Yong|date=2011-01-17|title=Inherently Chiral Calixarenes: Synthesis, Optical Resolution, Chiral Recognition and Asymmetric Catalysis|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/12/1/429|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=429–455|doi=10.3390/ijms12010429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chirality in these calixarenes is instead derived from the curvature of the molecule in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-31867-7|title=Calixarenes and Beyond {{!}} SpringerLink|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-31867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Definition ===
Due to the initial lack of a formal definition after the initial conception, the term inherent chirality was utilized to describe a variety of chiral molecules that don’t fall into other defined chirality types.  The first fully formulated definition of inherent chirality was published in 2004 by Mandolini and Schiaffino, (and later modified by Szumna):

''“inherent chirality arises from the introduction of a curvature in an ideal planar structure that is devoid of perpendicular symmetry planes in its bidimensional representation'''."'''''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Inherent chirality has been known by a variety of names in the literature including bowl chirality (in fullerene fragments), intrinsic chirality, helicity (see section 3a) residual enantiomers (as applied to sterically hindered molecular propellers,) and cyclochirality (though this is often considered to be a more specific example and cannot be applied to all inherently chiral molecules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A simple example of inherent chirality is that of corannulene commonly referred to as “bowl chirality” in the literature.  The chirality of an unsubstituted corranulene (containing no classic stereogenic centers) cannot be seen in a 2D representation, but becomes clear when a 3D representation is evoked, as the C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry of corranulenes provides the molecules with a source of chirality (figure 2.)  Racemization of these molecules is possible through an inversion of curvature, though some inherently chiral molecules have inversion barriers comparable to a classic chiral center.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Molecular Symmetry ==
[[File:3paracyclophane.png|thumb|150x150px|Inherently chiral paracyclophane, rendered chiral by the bromide substituent hindering rotation of the phenylene.]]

=== Chiral Plane ===
Some inherently chiral molecules contain [[Planar chirality|chirality planes]], or planes within a given molecules across which the molecule is dissymmetric.  Paracyclophanes often contain chiral planes if the bridge across the phenylene unit is short enough, or if the phenylene contains another substituent, not in the bridge, that hinders rotation of the phenylene unit.

=== Chiral axis ===
Similar to chirality planes, [[Axial chirality|chirality axes]] arise from an axis about which the spatial arrangement of substituents creates chirality.  This can be seen in helical molecules (see section 3a) as well as some alkenes.

== Other examples ==
[[File:10helicene.png|thumb|133x133px|Helicene molecule with inherent chirality.]]
Helical molecules are considered to have inherent chirality, but this is sometimes referred to as helical chirality or ''helicity''.  The IUPAC definition of helicity is: ''chirality of a helical, propeller or screw-shaped molecular entity.''  [[Helicene]]s (figure 4) are chiral polycyclic aromatic compounds that lack conventional chiral centers, but are chiral due to the helical shape of the 3D molecules.

[[Spiro compound#Chirality|Spiro compounds]] (compounds with a twisted structure of two or more rings) can have inherent chirality at the spiroatom, due to the twisting of the achiral ring system.

Inherently chiral alkenes have been synthesized through the use of a “buckle” where in an achiral, linear alkene is forced into a chiral conformation.  Alkenes have no classical chirality, so generally, an external stereogenic center must be introduced.  However, by locking the alkene into a conformation through the use of an achiral buckle allows for the creation of an inherently chiral alkene.  Inherently chiral alkenes have been synthesized through the use of dialkoxysilanes, with a large enough racemization barrier that enantiomers have been isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tomooka|first=Katsuhiko|last2=Miyasaka|first2=Shouji|last3=Motomura|first3=Shougo|last4=Igawa|first4=Kazunobu|date=2014-06-16|title=Planar Chiral Dialkoxysilane: Introduction of Inherent Chirality and High Reactivity in Conventional Achiral Alkene|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.201402434/abstract|journal=Chemistry – A European Journal|language=en|volume=20|issue=25|pages=7598–7602|doi=10.1002/chem.201402434|issn=1521-3765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juhamatti Tapio Aaltonen''' (born 4 June 1985) is a Finnish professional [[ice hockey]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|winger]], who currently plays for [[Skellefteå AIK]] of the [[Swedish Hockey League]]. Known for his skill and skating speed, Aaltonen was drafted by the [[St. Louis Blues]] as the 248th selection overall in the [[2003 NHL Entry Draft]].

==Playing career==
Aaltonen started his professional career with [[Oulun Kärpät]], playing with the team from 2002 to 2009 winning [[Kanada-malja|Finnish championship]] twice. After the years he spent with Kärpät, Aaltonen moved to [[Lahti]] to play for [[Pelicans (ice hockey)|Pelicans]], where he played his breakthrough year scoring 28 goals and 49 points in 58 games in regular season. He signed a five-year contract with Pelicans, but the contract also gave Aaltonen a possibility to play in other leagues.

This option in his contract was exercised on 15 June 2010, when he was loaned from the Pelicans to Russian club, [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]] of the KHL.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/csl.php?tid=5027 | title = Magnitogorsk Metallurg's 2010-11 Roster | publisher = ''hockeydb.com'' | date = 2015-10-02 | accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaltonen was an integral part of Metallurg's offense in his two seasons in the KHL before he opted to sign with Swedish club, Rögle BK of the then [[Swedish Hockey League|Elitserien]] on 15 October 2012. He made his debut in Sweden two-days later and in the [[2012-13 Elitserien season|2012–13]] season, contributed with 31 points in 42 regular season games.

After a season's long return with his original Finnish club, Kärpät, Aaltonen signed for his third Finnish team, and only KHL participant, Jokerit on 1 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.jokerit.com/aaltonen-liittyy-joukkueeseen | title = Aaltonen agrees to contract with Jokerit | publisher = ''[[Jokerit]]'' | date = 2014-08-01 | accessdate = 2014-08-01 | language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jokerit he had a season with [[Helsinki IFK]] in [[Liiga]] moving to SHL and Rögle for 2017-18.

Following the season [[2009-10 SM-liiga season|2009–10]] season, he was selected to join the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team]] and he played at the [[2010 IIHF World Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=IIHF|title=IIHF Media Guide &amp; Record Book 2011|year=2010 |publisher=Moydart Press |page= 317|isbn= 978-0-9867964-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the World Championship in [[2011 IIHF World Championship]]. He also played in the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|2014 Winter Olympics]], scoring the game-tying goal against Russia in the quarterfinal and went on to win bronze.

The term '''laterality''' refers to the preference most [[humans]] show for one side of their [[Human body|body]] over the other. Examples include [[Handedness|left-handedness/right-handedness]] and left/right-[[footedness]]; it may also refer to the primary use of the left or right hemisphere in the brain. It may also apply to animals or plants. The majority of tests have been conducted on humans, specifically to determine the effects on language.

== Human ==

The majority of humans are [[right-handed]]. Many are also right-sided in general (that is, they prefer to use their right [[human eye|eye]], right [[foot]] and right [[ear]] if forced to make a choice between the two). The reasons for this are not fully understood, but it is thought that because the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] of the [[brain]] controls the right side of the body, the right side is generally stronger; it is suggested that the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant over the right in most humans because in 90-92% of all humans, the left hemisphere is the [[language]] hemisphere.

Human [[culture]]s are predominantly right-handed, and so the right-sided trend may be socially as well as biologically enforced. This is quite apparent from a quick survey of [[language]]s. The [[English language|English]] word "left" comes from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] word ''lyft'' which means "weak" or "useless". Similarly, the [[French language|French]] word for left, ''gauche'', is also used to mean "awkward" or "tactless", and ''sinistra'', the [[Latin]] word from which the English word "sinister" was derived, means "left". Similarly, in many cultures the word for "right" also means "correct". The English word "right" comes from the Anglo-Saxon word ''riht'' which also means "straight" or "correct."

This linguistic and social bias is not restricted to European cultures: for example, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters are designed for right-handers to write, and no significant left-handed culture has ever been found in the world.

When a person is forced to use the hand opposite of the hand that they would naturally use, this is known as ''forced laterality'', or more specifically ''forced dextrality''.  A study done by the Department of Neurology at Keele University, North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary suggests that forced dextrality may be part of the reason that the percentage of left-handed people decreases with the higher age groups, both because the effects of pressures toward right-handedness are cumulative over time (hence increasing with age for any given person subjected to them) and because the prevalence of such pressure is decreasing, such that fewer members of younger generations face any such pressure to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = E. | last4 = Joses | first4 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Is forced dextrality an explanation for the fall in the prevalence of sinistrality with age? A study in northern England | url = | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 41–44 | doi=10.1136/jech.52.1.41| pmid = 9604040 | pmc = 1756611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ambidexterity]] is when a person has approximately equal skill with both [[hand]]s and/or both sides of the body. True ambidexterity is very rare. Although a small number of people can write competently with both hands and use both sides of their body well, even these people usually show preference for one side of their body over the other. However, this preference is not necessarily consistent for all activities. Some people may for example use their right hand for [[writing]], and their [[left-handed|left hand]] for playing [[List of sports#Racket sports|racket sports]] and [[eating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oldfield | first1 = R.C. | year = 1971 | title = The assessment and analysis of handedness: The Edinburgh inventory | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 97–113 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4 | pmid=5146491}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''see also:'' [[cross-dominance]]).

Also, it is not uncommon that people preferring to use the right hand prefer to use the left leg, e.g. when using a shovel, kicking a ball, or operating control pedals. In many cases, this may be because they are disposed for left-handedness but have been trained for right-handedness. In the sport of [[cricket]], some players may find that they are more comfortable bowling with their left or right hand, but batting with the other hand.

Approximate statistics are below:&lt;ref&gt;C. Porac and S. Coren. ''Lateral preferences and human behavior''. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Favoring right hand: 88.2%
*Favoring right foot: 81.0%
*Favoring right eye: 71.1%
*Favoring right ear: 59.1%
*Same hand and foot: 84%
*Same ear and eye: 61.8%

Laterality of motor and sensory control has been the subject of a recent intense study and review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimickingman.com Mimicking Man.com.] I. Derakhshan, MD, Neurologist.&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out that the hemisphere of speech is the hemisphere of action in general and that the command hemisphere is located either in the right or the left hemisphere (never in both). Around eighty percent of people are left hemispheric for speech and the remainder are right hemispheric: ninety percent of right-handers are left hemispheric for speech, but only fifty percent of left-handers are right hemispheric for speech (the remainder are left hemispheric). The reaction time of the neurally dominant side of the body (the side opposite to the major hemisphere or the command center, as just defined) is shorter than that of the opposite side by an interval equal to the interhemispheric transfer time. Thus, one in five persons has a handedness that is the opposite for which they are wired (per laterality of command center or brainedness, as determined by reaction time study mentioned above).

===Different expressions===
* Board [[footedness]]: The stance in a board sport is not necessarily the same as the normal footedness of the person. In skateboarding and other board sports a goofy footed stance is one with the right foot leading.  A stance with the left foot forward is called regular or normal.
* Jump and spin: Direction of rotation in [[figure skating jumps]] and spins is not necessarily the same as the footedness or the handedness of each person. A skater can jump and spin counter-clockwise (the most common direction), yet be left-footed and left-handed.
* [[Ocular dominance]]:  The eye preferred when binocular vision is not possible, as through a keyhole or monocular microscope.

=== Speech ===

Cerebral dominance or specialization has been studied in relation to a variety of human functions. With speech in particular, many studies have been used as evidence that it is generally localized in the [[Cerebral hemisphere|left hemisphere]]. Research comparing the effects of lesions in the two hemispheres, [[split-brain]] patients, and perceptual asymmetries have aided in the knowledge of speech lateralization.  In one particular study, the left hemisphere’s sensitivity to differences in rapidly changing sound cues was noted (Annett, 1991).  This has real world implication, since very fine acoustic discriminations are needed to comprehend and produce speech signals.  In an electrical stimulation demonstration performed by Ojemann and Mateer (1979), the exposed [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] was mapped revealing the same cortical sites were activated in phoneme discrimination and mouth movement sequences (Annett, 1991).

As suggested by Kimura (1975, 1982), left hemisphere speech lateralization might be based upon a preference for movement sequences as demonstrated by [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) studies.  Since ASL requires intricate hand movements for language communication, it was proposed that skilled hand motions and speech require sequences of action over time. In deaf patients suffering from a left hemispheric [[stroke]] and damage, noticeable losses in their abilities to sign were noted.  These cases were compared to studies of normal speakers with dysphasias located at lesioned areas similar to the deaf patients.  In the same study, deaf patients with right hemispheric lesions did not display any significant loss of signing nor any decreased capacity for motor sequencing (Annett, 1991).

One theory, known as the acoustic laterality theory, the physical properties of certain speech sounds are what determine laterality to the left hemisphere.  Stop consonants, for example t, p, or k, leave a defined silent period at the end of words that can easily be distinguished.  This theory postulates that changing sounds such as these are preferentially processed by the left hemisphere.  As a result of the right ear being responsible for transmission to sounds to the left hemisphere, it is capable of perceiving these sounds with rapid changes.  This right ear advantage in hearing and speech laterality was evidenced in [[Dichotic listening test|dichotic listening studies]]. [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic imaging]] results from this study showed greater left hemisphere activation when actual words were presented as opposed to pseudo-words (Shtyrov, Pihko, and Pulvermuller, 2005).  Two important aspects of speech recognition are phonetic cues, such as format patterning, and prosody cues, such as intonation, accent, and emotional state of the speaker (Imaizumi, Koichi, Kiritani, Hosoi &amp; Tonoike, 1998).

In a study done with both [[Monolingualism|monolinguals]] and [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]], which took into account language experience, second language proficiency, and onset of bilingualism among other variables, researchers were able to demonstrate left hemispheric dominance.  In addition, bilinguals that began speaking a second language early in life demonstrated bilateral hemispheric involvement.  The findings of this study were able to predict differing patterns of cerebral language lateralization in adulthood (Hull &amp; Vaid, 2006).

== In other animals ==
It has been shown that cerebral lateralization is a widespread phenomenon in the [[animal|animal kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Lesley J., Andrew, Richard J. (2002) Comparative Vertebrate Lateralization, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Functional and structural differences between left and right brain hemispheres can be found in many other vertebrates and also in invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Manns"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Manns, M.  |author2=Ströckens, F.|year=2014|title=Functional and structural comparison of visual lateralization in birds–similar but still different|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|pages=206|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00206|pmid=24723898|pmc=3971188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that negative, withdrawal-associated emotions are processed predominantly by the right hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is largely responsible for processing positive, approach-related emotions.  This has been called the "laterality-[[Valence (psychology)|valence]] hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Barnard2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barnard, S., Matthews, L., Messori, S., Podaliri-Vulpiani, M. and Ferri, N.|year=2015|title=Laterality as an indicator of emotional stress in ewes and lambs during a separation test|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0928-3|pmid=26433604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sub-set of laterality in animals is limb dominance. Preferential limb use for specific tasks has been shown in species including chimpanzees, mice, bats, wallabies, parrots, chickens and toads.&lt;ref name="Manns" /&gt;

Another form of laterality is hemispheric dominance for processing conspecific vocalizations, reported for chimpanzees, sea lions, dogs, zebra finches and Bengalese finches.&lt;ref name="Manns" /&gt;

=== In mammals ===
[[Domestic horse]]s (''Equus ferus caballus'') exhibit laterality in at least two areas of neural organization, i.e. sensory and motor. In [[thoroughbred]]s, the strength of motor laterality increases with age.  Horses under 4 years old have a preference to initially use the right nostril during olfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Motor and sensory laterality in thoroughbred horses|author1=McGreevy, P.  |author2=Rogers, L.|year= 2005|journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science|doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2004.11.012|issue = 4|volume = 92|pages = 337–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with olfaction, French horses have an eye laterality when looking at novel objects. There is a correlation between their score on an emotional index and eye preference; horses with higher emotionality are more likely to look with their left eye. The less emotive [[French saddlebred]]s glance at novel objects using the right eye, however, this tendency is absent in the [[Trotter (horse)|trotters]], although the emotive index is the same for both breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laterality of horses associated with emotionality in novel situations|author=Larose, C., Richard-Yris, M.-A., Hausberger, M. and Rogers, L.J.|year=2006|journal = Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|doi = 10.1080/13576500600624221|pmid = 16754236|issue = 4|pages = 355–367|volume = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racehorse]]s exhibit laterality in stride patterns as well. They use their preferred stride pattern at all times whether racing or not, unless they are forced to change it while turning, injured, or fatigued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laterality in stride pattern preference in racehorses|author1=Williams, D.E.  |author2=Norris, B.J|year=2007|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.01.014|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|pages = 941–950|volume = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[domestic dogs]] (''Canis familiaris''), there is a correlation between motor laterality and noise sensitivity  - a lack of paw preference is associated with noise-related fearfulness. (Branson and Rogers, 2006){{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Fearfulness is an undesirable trait in guide dogs, therefore, testing for laterality can be a useful predictor of a successful guide dog. Knowing a guide dog's laterality can also be useful for training because the dog may be better at walking to the left or the right of their blind owner.&lt;ref name="Tomkins"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Tomkins, L.M., Thomson, P.C. and McGreevy, P.D.|year=2010|title = First-stepping Test as a measure of motor laterality in dogs (Canis familiaris) | url = | journal = Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research | volume = 5 | issue = 5| pages = 247–255 | doi = 10.1016/j.jveb.2010.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic cat]]s (''Felis silvestris catus'') show an individual handedness when reaching for static food.  In one study, 46% preferred to use the right paw, 44% the left, and 10% were ambi-lateral; 60% used one paw 100% of the time.  There was no difference between male and female cats in the proportions of left and right paw preferences. In moving-target reaching tests, cats have a left-sided behavioural asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=39|issue=3|year=1997|pages=241–247|title=Paw preferences in cats (Felis silvestris catus) living in a household environment|doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(96)00758-9|author1=Pike, A.V.L.  |author2=Maitland, D.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study indicates that laterality in this species is strongly related to temperament. Furthermore, individuals with stronger paw preferences are rated as more confident, affectionate, active, and friendly.&lt;ref name="McDowell2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author=McDowell, L.J., Wells, D.L., Hepper, P.G. and Dempster, M.|year=2016|title=Lateral bias and temperament in the domestic cat (Felis Silvestris)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chimpanzee]]s show right-handedness in certain conditions.  This is expressed at the population level for females, but not males.  The complexity of the task has a dominant effect on handedness in chimps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Llorente, M., Riba, D., Palou, L., Carrasco, L., Mosquera, M., Colell, M. and Feliu, O.|year=2011|title=Population‐level right‐handedness for a coordinated bimanual task in naturalistic housed chimpanzees: replication and extension in 114 animals from Zambia and Spain|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=73|issue=3|pages=281–290|doi=10.1002/ajp.20895|pmid=20954250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cattle]] use [[Lateralization of brain function|visual/brain lateralisation]] in their visual scanning of novel and familiar stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Phillips, C.J.C., Oevermans, H., Syrett, K.L., Jespersen, A.Y. and Pearce, G.P. |year=2015 |title=Lateralization of behavior in dairy cows in response to conspecifics and novel persons |journal=Journal of Dairy Science |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=2389–2400 |doi=10.3168/jds.2014-8648|pmid=25648820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Domestic cattle prefer to view novel stimuli with the left eye, (similar to horses, Australian magpies, chicks, toads and fish) but use the right eye for viewing familiar stimuli.&lt;ref name="Robins"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Robins, A.  |author2=Phillips, C. |year=2010 |title=Lateralised visual processing in domestic cattle herds responding to novel and familiar stimuli |journal=Laterality |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=514–534 |doi=10.1080/13576500903049324|pmid=19629847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schreibers' long-fingered bat]] is lateralized at the population level and shows a left-hand bias for climbing or grasping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zucca |first1=P. |last2=Palladini |first2=A. |last3=Baciadonna |first3=L. |last4=Scaravelli |first4=D. |year=2010 |title=Handedness in the echolocating Schreiber's long-fingered bat (''Miniopterus schreibersii'') |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=693–695 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2010.04.006|pmid=20399840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of [[mastodon]] indicate laterality through the fossil remains having differing tusk lengths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====In marsupials====
[[Marsupials]] are fundamentally different from other mammals in that they lack a [[corpus callosum]].&lt;ref name="Nowak1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nowak |first=Ronald M. |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |date=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-5789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, wild [[kangaroo]]s and other [[Macropodidae|macropod]] [[marsupial]]s have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks.  Left-handedness is particularly apparent in the [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') and the [[eastern gray kangaroo]] (''Macropus giganteus'').  The [[red-necked wallaby]] (''Macropus rufogriseus'') preferentially uses the left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength.  There is less evidence for handedness in [[arboreal]] species.&lt;ref name="Sci-News"&gt;{{cite web |title=All kangaroos are lefties, scientists say |publisher=Sci-News.com |url=http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-kangaroos-lefties-02929.html |date=June 18, 2015 |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[Parrot]]s tend to favor one foot when grasping objects (for example fruit when feeding). Some studies indicate that most parrots are left footed.&lt;ref&gt;Zeigler, H. Phillip &amp; Hans-Joachim Bischof, eds. ''Vision, Brain, and Behavior in Birds.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian magpie]] (''Gymnorhina tibicen'') uses both left-eye and right-eye laterality when performing anti-predator responses, which include [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]].  Prior to withdrawing from a potential predator, Australian magpies view the animal with the left eye (85%), but prior to approaching, the right eye is used (72%). The left eye is used prior to jumping (73%) and prior to circling (65%) the predator, as well as during circling (58%) and for high alert inspection of the predator (72%). The researchers commented that "mobbing and perhaps circling are agonistic responses controlled by the LE[left eye]/right hemisphere, as also seen in other species. Alert inspection involves detailed examination of the predator and likely high levels of fear, known to be right hemisphere function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koboroff, A., Kaplan, G. and Rogers, L.J.|year=2008|title=Hemispheric specialization in Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) shown as eye preferences during response to a predator|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=76|issue=3|pages=304–306|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2008.02.015|pmid=18498946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yellow-legged gull]] (''Larus michahellis'') chicks show laterality when reverting from a supine to prone posture, and also in pecking at a dummy parental bill to beg for food. Lateralization occurs at both the population and individual level in the reverting response and at the individual level in begging. Females have a leftward preference in the righting response, indicating this is sex dependent. Laterality in the begging response in chicks varies according to laying order and matches variation in egg [[androgen]]s concentration.

===In fish===
Laterality determines the organisation of rainbowfish (''Melanotaenia'' spp.) schools.  These fish demonstrate an individual eye preference when examining their reflection in a mirror.  Fish which show a right-eye preference in the mirror test prefer to be on the left side of the school. Conversely, fish that show a left-eye preference in the mirror test or were non-lateralised, prefer to be slightly to the right side of the school. The behaviour depends on the species and sex of the school.&lt;ref name="Bibost"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bibost, A-L.  |author2=Brown, C.|year=2013|title=Laterality enhances schooling position in rainbowfish, Melaotaenia spp|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e80907|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0080907|pmid=24260506|pmc=3829960|bibcode=2013PLoSO...880907B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In amphibians===
Three species of toads, the [[common toad]] (''Bufo bufo''), [[Bufo viridis|green toad]] (''Bufo viridis'') and the [[cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus'') show stronger escape and defensive responses when a model predator was placed on the toad's left side compared to their right side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lippolis, G., Bisazza, A., Rogers, L.

===In invertebrates===
The [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] (''Ceratitis capitata'') exhibits left-biased population-level lateralisation of aggressive displays (boxing with forelegs and wing strikes) with no sex-differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Benelli, G., Donati, E., Romano, D., Stefanini, C., Messing, R.

'''Life extension''' is the idea of extending the human [[life expectancy|lifespan]], either modestly &amp;ndash; through improvements in medicine &amp;ndash; or dramatically by increasing the [[maximum lifespan]] beyond its generally settled limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner BS |title=Can We Live Forever? A Sociological and Moral Inquiry |publisher=Anthem Press |year=2009 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to achieve such dramatic changes, however, does not currently exist.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;

Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]], [[stem cell]]s, [[regenerative medicine]], [[molecular]] repair, [[gene therapy]], pharmaceuticals, and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] replacement (such as with artificial organs or [[xenotransplantation]]s) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agerasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by [[bioethicist]]s.

The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50&amp;nbsp;billion of revenue a year in 2009.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holliday&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6 |pmid=18726707 |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=223–8 |year=2008 |last1=Holliday |first1=Robin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name= EMBOSENS/&gt;

==Average and maximum lifespan==
{{Main|Senescence}}
During the process of [[aging]], an organism accumulates damage to its [[macromolecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by "genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2013 | title = The hallmarks of aging | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1194–1217 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.039 | pmid = 23746838 | pmc = 3836174 | author1 = López-Otín | first1 = C | last2 = Blasco | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Partridge | first3 = L | last4 = Serrano | first4 = M | last5 = Kroemer | first5 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxidation]] damage to cellular contents caused by [[free radicals]] is believed to contribute to aging as well.&lt;ref name="Halliwell B 2007"&gt;Halliwell B, Gutteridge JMC (2007). Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, USA, {{ISBN|019856869X}}, {{ISBN|978-0198568698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1383772 | volume=275 | issue=3–6 | title=Oxidative and other DNA damages as the basis of aging: a review | date=September 1992 | pages=305–15 | doi=10.1016/0921-8734(92)90034-M | journal=Mutation Research/DNAging| author1=Holmes | first1=G. E. | last2=Bernstein | first2=C | last3=Bernstein | first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a [[wildtype]] [[mouse]], commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years.&lt;ref name="Mouse Genome Informatics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/other/mouse_facts1.shtml|title=Mouse Facts|publisher=informatics.jax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant]] defenses, [[energy metabolism]], [[proteostasis]] maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as [[autophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senescence.info/causes_of_aging.html|title=What Causes Aging? Damage-Based Theories of Aging|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average lifespan in a population is lowered by [[infant mortality|infant]] and [[child mortality]], which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age-related [[chronic disease]] such as [[cancer]] or [[cardiovascular disease]] play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, [[vaccinations]], good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

[[Maximum lifespan]] is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as [[nematode]]s, fruit flies, and mice include [[caloric restriction]], [[gene manipulation]], and administration of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Aging biology: a new frontier for drug discovery | journal = Expert Opin Drug Discov | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 217–229 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2012.660144 | pmid = 22468953 | author1 = Verdaguer | first1 = E | last2 = Junyent | first2 = F | last3 = Folch | first3 = J | last4 = Beas-Zarate | first4 = C | last5 = Auladell | first5 = C | last6 = Pallàs | first6 = M | last7 = Camins | first7 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = The evolution of late life | journal = Ageing Res Rev. | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 14–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2005.06.003 | pmid = 16085467 | author1 = Rauser | first1 = C.

===Diets and supplements===
Much life extension research focuses on nutrition—[[diet (nutrition)|diets]] or [[dietary supplement|supplements]]— although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. {{original research inline|date=January 2015}}

In some studies [[calorie restriction]] has been shown to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=redmanCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Metabolic and behavioral compensations in response to caloric restriction: implications for the maintenance of weight loss | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 2| page = e4377 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004377 | pmid=19198647 | pmc=2634841 | author=[[Leanne Redman|Redman LM]], Heilbronn LK, Martin CK, de Jonge L, Williamson DA, Delany JP, Ravussin E| bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4377R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=source6&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holloszy JO|author2= Fontana L | year = 2007 | title = Caloric restriction in humans | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 42 | issue = 8| pages = 709–12 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.03.009 | pmid=17482403 | pmc=2020845}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys.&lt;ref name=mattisonCR&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2012 | title = Impact of caloric restriction on health and survival in rhesus monkeys from the NIA study | journal = Nature | volume = 489 | issue = 7415| pages = 318–321 | doi=10.1038/nature11432 | pmid=22932268 | pmc=3832985 | author=Mattison JA, Roth GS, Beasley TM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2012Natur.489..318M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans the long-term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown.&lt;ref name='Spindler, 2010'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spindler |first1=Stephen R. |title=The Future of Aging |pages=367–438 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3999-6_12 |chapter=Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging |isbn=978-90-481-3998-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-radical theory]] of [[aging]] suggests that [[antioxidant]] supplements might extend human life. However, evidence suggest that [[beta-Carotene|β-carotene]] supplements and high doses of vitamin&amp;nbsp;E increase mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bjelakovic, Goran|author2= Nikolova, Dimitrinka|author3= Lotte Gluud, Lise|author4= Simonetti Rosa G.|author5= Gluud Christian | year = 2007 | title = Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8| pages = 842–857 | doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 | pmid=17327526}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resveratrol]] is a [[Sir2|sirtuin]] stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models, but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of 2011.&lt;ref name=Fer2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernández AF|author2= Fraga MF | title = The effects of the dietary polyphenol resveratrol on human healthy aging and lifespan | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–4 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21613817 | doi = 10.4161/epi.6.7.16499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hormone treatment===
The anti-aging industry offers several [[hormone therapies]]. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the [[American Medical Association]] has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |date=15 June 2009 |title=AMA report questions science behind using hormones as anti-aging treatment |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-15/news/0906140132_1_anti-aging-hormones-ama-council |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[growth hormone]] (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or [[IGF-1]] modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.&lt;ref name=AgingMaleRev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattler FR | title = Growth hormone in the aging male | journal = Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 541–55 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24054930 | doi = 10.1016/j.beem.2013.05.003 | quote = In animal models, alterations in GH/IGF-1 signaling with reductions in these somatotrophs appear to increase life span. &amp;nbsp;... Administration of IGF-1Eb (mechanogrowth factor) stimulates proliferation of myoblasts and induces muscle hypertrophy. Increases in GH and IGF-1 during adolescence are beneficial for brain and cardiovascular function during the aging process and GH administration during adolescence is vasoprotective and increases life-span.&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;... Studies relating GH and IGF-1 status to longevity provide inconsistent evidence as to whether decreased (somatopause) or high levels (e.g. acromegaly) of these hormones are beneficial or detrimental to longevity.&amp;nbsp;... It is difficult to reconcile the largely protective effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on longevity in animals with the inconsistent or deleterious effects of low levels or declining GH/IGF-1 during human aging.| pmc = 3940699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the Egyptian [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Smith medical papyrus]], all the way through the [[Taoists]], [[Ayurveda]] practitioners, [[alchemists]], [[hygienist]]s such as [[Luigi Cornaro]], Johann Cohausen and [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]], and philosophers such as [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and Nicolas [[Condorcet]]. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called "[[fin-de-siècle]]" (end of the century) period, denoted as an "end of an epoch" and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist [[Elie Metchnikoff]] (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Ilia|title=A History of Life-Extensionism in the Twentieth Century|date=2014|publisher=Longevity History|isbn=1500818577|url=http://www.longevityhistory.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He cites [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'', wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), founding member of the [[Royal Society]], also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as "to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young". Biologist [[Alexis Carrel]] (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with [[Cell (biology)|cells]], says Hughes.&lt;ref name="HughesTranshumanism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=James|author-link=James Hughes (sociologist)|title=Leadership in Science and Technology: A Reference Handbook|date=October 20, 2011|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=1452266522|page=587|chapter=Transhumanism|editor1-last=Bainbridge|editor1-first=William|editor1-link=William Sims Bainbridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the [[American Aging Association]] was formed under the impetus of [[Denham Harman]], originator of the [[free radical theory]] of [[aging]]. Harman wanted an organization of [[biogerontologist]]s that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.

In 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote ''No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life'', ({{ISBN|0-440-36247-4}}) the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by [[Claude Pepper]] of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.

[[Saul Kent]] published ''The Life Extension Revolution'' ({{ISBN|0-688-03580-9}}) in 1980 and created a [[nutraceutical]] firm called the [[Life Extension Foundation]], a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called ''Life Extension Magazine''. The 1982 bestselling book ''[[Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach]]'' ({{ISBN|0-446-51229-X}}) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw (writer)|Sandy Shaw]] further popularized the phrase "life extension".

Regulatory and legal struggles between the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, [[Saul Kent]] and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a "Holocaust" and "seeking gestapo-like power" through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ty |last=Clevenger |date=Summer 2000 |title=Internet pharmacies: cyberspace versus the regulatory state |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |journal=Journal of Law and Health |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918191534/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |archivedate=18 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] published "The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging," by [[Michael D. West]]. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=West, Michael D. |title=The Immortal Cell: One Scientist's Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZnuAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0-385-50928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern life extensionists include writer [[Gennady Stolyarov II|Gennady Stolyarov]], who insists that death is "the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology";&lt;ref name="stolyarov"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Stolyarov|first1 = Gennady|title = Death is Wrong|date = November 25, 2013|publisher = Rational Argumentator Press|isbn = 978-0615932040|url = http://rationalargumentator.com/Death_is_Wrong_Second_Edition_Full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[Zoltan Istvan]], who proposes that the "transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else";&lt;ref name="istvan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Istvan|first1=Zoltan|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/the-three-laws-of-transhu_b_5853596.html |title=The Morality of Artificial Intelligence and the Three Laws of Transhumanism |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; futurist [[George Dvorsky]], who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved;&lt;ref name=aja&gt;{{cite web|title=Futurist: 'I will reap benefits of life extension'|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/fault-lines/articles/2015/5/7/futurist-itll-start-to-become-ridiculous-not-to-talk-about-curing-aging.html|website=Al Jazeera America|date=May 7, 2015|quote=To Dvorsky, aging is a problem that’s desperately in need of solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording artist [[Steve Aoki]], who has been called "one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension".&lt;ref name=tez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tez|first1=Riva Melissa|title=Steve Aoki, Dan Bilzerian, a giraffe and the search for eternal life|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/steve-aoki-dan-bilzerian-a-giraffe-and-the-search-for-eternal-life|website=i-D|publisher=VICE|date=May 11, 2015|quote=Unknown to most, Steve is both an undeniable champion of life expansion as well as one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension.

[...] Set up by the Steve Aoki Charitable Fund, the profits from the Dan Bilzerian party went to life extension research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===

In 1991, the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) was formed. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.&lt;ref name="NYTPoison"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alex |last= Kuczynski |date=12 April 1998 |title=Anti-Aging Potion Or Poison? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Aubrey de Grey]] and [[David Gobel]] formed the [[Methuselah Foundation]], which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the [[SENS Research Foundation]], a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sens.org/files/pdf/2011_Research_Report.pdf research report 2011]. Sens Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Google]] announced [[Calico (company)|Calico]], a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/03/tech/innovation/google-calico-aging-death/|title=How Google's Calico aims to fight aging and 'solve death'|author=Arion McNicoll, Arion |date=3 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by [[Arthur D.

Barron]], [[David Botstein]], and [[Cynthia Kenyon]]. In 2014, biologist [[Craig Venter]] founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/human-longevity-inc-hli-launched-to-promote-healthy-aging-using-advances-in-genomics-and-stem-cell-therapies-248379091.html|title=Human Longevity Inc.

Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/young-blood-mice-aging/|title=Young blood makes old mice more youthful|author=Landau, Elizabeth |date=5 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/gdf11-protein-aging-mice-harvard/31929/ "Harvard researchers find protein that could reverse the aging process"].

==Ethics and politics ==
Politics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--Need some clarification here. The title implies the discussion is on the politics/ethics of all life extension practices, not just marketing of pharma/surgery--&gt;

In the [[United States]], product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ([[freedom of speech]]) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--This is just the opening paragraph, describing the political arena and stage of conflict. More to follow.--&gt;

===Scientific controversy===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, [[Leonard Hayflick]], who determined that [[fibroblast]]s are limited to around 50&amp;nbsp;cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of [[entropy]]. Hayflick and fellow [[biogerontologist]]s [[S. Jay Olshansky|Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging [[dietary supplement|supplements]].&lt;ref name="PositionStatement"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Position statement on human aging |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=B292–7 |date=1 August 2002 |pmid=12145354 |doi=10.1093/gerona/57.8.B292|author1=Olshansky |first1=S. J. |last2=Hayflick |first2=L |last3=Carnes |first3=B. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a good place to link into the broader social debate on life extension ethics. Hayflick is not the only one to object to the portrayal/treatment of aging as a disease. Many doctors, social scientists, feminists, etc. do too--&gt;

===Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Feedback Information and Consumer Motivation.

===Political parties===
Though many scientists state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging |publisher=Imminst.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fightaging.org |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Valley===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes [[Larry Ellison]] (founder of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]), [[Peter Thiel]] (former [[Paypal]] CEO),&lt;ref&gt;Veritas Forum Q&amp;A with Peter Thiel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQHrJvwnOzo&amp;list=PLCNNepS_4NcyOSlUdWOcTUCeUbK8nuywQ&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Page]] (co-founder of [[Google]]), and [[Peter Diamandis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Leon Kass]] (chairman of the US [[President's Council on Bioethics]] from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] problems would make life extension unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Smith |date=3 December 2002 |title=Killing Immortality |url=http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040607195722/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archivedate=7 June 2004 |publisher=Betterhumans |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
{{Quote|"simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and [[narcissistic]] wish incompatible with devotion to posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Leon |last=Kass |authorlink= Leon Kass |year=1985 |title=Toward a more natural science: biology and human affairs |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-02-918340-3 |oclc=11677465 |page= 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2007) ''Enhancing Evolution: The ethical case for making better people''. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.&lt;ref name="Guardian2006"&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |date=9 May 2006 |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended metaphor entitled "The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant", Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Bostrom, N |title=The fable of the dragon tyrant |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=273–7 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15863685 |pmc=1734155 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2004.009035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overpopulation concerns===

Controversy about life extension is due to fear of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and possible effects on society.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2005/02/superlongevity-without-overpopulation-1.php|title=Superlongevity Without Overpopulation|work=Fight Aging!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogerontologist [[Aubrey De Grey]] counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate [[menopause]], allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus ''decreasing'' the yearly population growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-ethics-of-anti-aging-by-peter-singer|title=Peter Singer on Should We Live to 1,000? – Project Syndicate|work=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the philosopher and futurist [[Max More]] argues that, given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="Superlongevity Without Overpopulation"/&gt;

===Opinion polls===

A Spring 2013 [[Pew Research]] poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an "ideal lifespan" to be more than 120 years. The median "ideal lifespan" was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society.&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"/&gt; One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Magalhães JP | year = 2014 | title = The scientific quest for lasting youth: prospects for curing aging | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 458–67 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2014.1580 | pmid = 25132068 | pmc = 4203147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated,&lt;ref name="pewforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/|title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans’ Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension|date=6 August 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some variation exists between religious denominations.

==Aging as a disease==
Mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] says: "I&amp;nbsp;don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayden EC | year = 2007 | title = A new angle on 'old' | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = 7170| pages = 603–603 | doi = 10.1038/450603a | pmid=18046373| bibcode = 2007Natur.450..603H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerman D. (2007) ''Geriatric Bioscience: The link between aging &amp; disease''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for [[AARP]], notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moody HR|title=Who's afraid of life extension?|journal= Generations|volume=25|issue= 4 |year=2002|pages= 33–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease.&lt;ref name=Gems1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Aging: To Treat, or Not to Treat? The possibility of treating aging is not just an idle fantasy | journal = American Scientist | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 278–80 | doi = 10.1511/2011.91.278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that [[Basenji]] are not dogs because they do not bark.&lt;ref name=Gems2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Tragedy and delight: the ethics of decelerated ageing | journal = Philos Trans R Soc B | volume = 366 | issue = 1561| pages = 108–112 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0288| pmc = 3001315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the universality of aging he calls it a "special sort of disease". Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms "aging syndrome" and "disease complex" in 1954 to describe aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Perlman RM | year = 1954 | title = The aging syndrome | journal = J Am Geriatr Soc | volume = 2 | pages = 123–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.&lt;ref name=Gems2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15197284| year = 2004| author1 = Mehlman| first1 = M.

==Research==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme [[telomerase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rando TA|author2= Chang HY|authorlink2=Howard Y.

Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through [[genetic engineering]] and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and [[caloric restriction]].&lt;ref name=Shmookle&gt;{{cite journal | date = 2009 | title = Extreme-longevity mutations orchestrate silencing of multiple signaling pathways| journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1790 | issue = 10| pages = 1075–83 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.05.011 | pmid = 19465083 | pmc=2885961| author1 = Shmookler Reis| first1 = R. J.| last2 = Bharill| first2 = P| last3 = Tazearslan| first3 = C| last4 = Ayyadevara| first4 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review of longevity research noted: "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a "life-extension factor" that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology."&lt;ref name=Shmookle/&gt;

===Anti-aging drugs===

There are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in [[animal model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Childs et al. (2015). [http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v21/n12/full/nm.4000.html Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy] Nature Medicine {{doi|10.1038/nm.4000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of research is related to the observed effects of a [[calorie restriction]] (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last2 = Shanmuganayagam| first1 = M. | first2 = D.| last1 = Anderson| title = Caloric restriction and aging: studies in mice and monkeys| last3 = Weindruch | first3 = R.| journal = Toxicologic pathology| volume = 37| issue = 1| pages = 47–51| year = 2009| pmid = 19075044| doi = 10.1177/0192623308329476| pmc = 3734859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet, which are known as [[Caloric restriction mimetic]] drugs.  Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR-mimic effect; they include [[rapamycin]],&lt;ref name=source25&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title = Rapamycin fed late in life extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice | journal = Nature | volume = 460 |pages = 392–5 | doi=10.1038/nature08221 | pmid=19587680 | pmc=2786175 | author=Harrison DE, Strong R, Sharp ZD, ''et al.''| bibcode=2009Natur.460..392H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[metformin]] and other [[geroprotector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2005 | title = Identification of Potential Caloric Restriction Mimetics by Microarray Profiling | journal = Physiological Genomics | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 343–50 | pmid = 16189280 | doi=10.1152/physiolgenomics.00069.2005 | author=Dhahbi JM, Mote PL, Fahy GM, Spindler SR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MitoQ]], [[resveratrol]] and [[pterostilbene]] are [[dietary supplements]] that have also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Kaeberlein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaeberlein|first=Matt|title=Resveratrol, pterostilbene and rapamycin:are they anti-aging drugs?|journal=BioEssays|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=96–99|doi=10.1002/bies.200900171|pmid=20091754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Low Dose of Dietary Resveratrol Partially Mimics Caloric Restriction and Retards Aging Parameters in Mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 3| issue = 6| pages = e2264| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002264 | pmid=18523577 | pmc=2386967 | year=2008 | author=Barger JL, Kayo T, Vann JM, ''et al.''| bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2264B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23691264 | doi=10.1155/2013/575482 | volume=2013 | title=A review of pterostilbene antioxidant activity and disease modification | pmc=3649683 | year=2013 | journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev | page=575482 | author=McCormack D, McFadden D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other attempts to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme [[telomerase]] in order to counter the process of [[telomere shortening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Telomeres and Telomerase Basic Science Implications for Aging | journal = American Geriatrics Society | volume = 49 | issue = 8| pages = 1105–1109 | doi = 10.1046/j.1532-5415.2001.49217.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-05-0147| pmid = 16179494| title = Telomerase and Cancer: Kirk A.

===Nanotechnology===
Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated [[Cell (biology)|cell]] repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular [[computers]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical [[nanomachines]] (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Cloning and body part replacement===
Some life extensionists suggest that [[therapeutic cloning]] and [[stem cell]] research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as [[reproductive cloning]]) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Donald |last=Melanson |date=April 22, 2008 |title=DoD establishes institute tasked with regrowing body parts |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/22/dod-establishes-institute-tasked-with-regrowing-body-parts/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to [[transplant rejection|rejection]] and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Roxanne |last=Khamsi |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Bio-engineered bladders successful in patients |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8939-bioengineered-bladders-successful-in-patients.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human [[stem cells]], particularly [[embryonic stem cells]], is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Christine |last=White |date=19 August 2005 |title=Umbilical stem cell breakthrough |url=http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720054316/http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |archivedate=20 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to [[reproductive cloning]]. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

===Cyborgs===
{{Main|Cyborg}}
Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the [[2045 Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;David Segal for the New York Times. 1 June 2013 [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/dmitry-itskov-and-the-avatar-quest.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
{{Main|Cryonics}}
For cryonicists (advocates of [[cryopreservation]]), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an "ambulance" into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate [[cryogenic]] temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the [[cryopreservation]] process.

Many cryonicists do not believe that [[legal death]] is "[[Medical definition of death|real death]]" because stoppage of [[heart rate|heartbeat]] and [[breath]]ing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Even at room [[temperature]], cells may take hours to die and days to [[decompose]]. Although [[neurological]] damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] processes do not manifest for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Neuronal necrosis after middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats progresses at different time intervals in the caudoputamen and the cortex |journal=Stroke |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=636–42; discussion 643 |date=1995 |pmid=7709411 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.26.4.636 |author=Garcia JH, Liu KF, Ho KL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonicists {{who|date=July 2017}}state that rapid cooling and [[heart|cardio]]-[[lung|pulmonary]] support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] for long-term preservation at [[cryogenic]] [[temperature]]s. People, particularly children, have survived up to an hour without heartbeat after submersion in ice water. In one case, full recovery was reported after 45 minutes underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Full recovery after 45 min accidental submersion |journal=Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |page=524 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11967613 |doi=10.1007/s00134-002-1245-2 |author=Perk L, Borger van de Burg F, Berendsen HH, van't Wout JW}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate rapid preservation of cells and tissue, cryonics "standby teams" are available to wait by the bedside of patients who are to be cryopreserved to apply cooling and cardio-pulmonary support as soon as possible after declaration of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/standby.html |title=Comprehensive Member Standby |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[mammal]] has been successfully cryopreserved and brought back to life, with the exception of [[embryo cryopreservation|frozen human embryos]]. Resuscitation of a postembryonic human from [[cryonics]] is not possible with current science. Some scientists still support the idea based on their expectations of the [[technological singularity|capabilities of future science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imminst.org/cryonics_letter/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |title=Advances in Cryonics |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategies for engineered negligible senescence===
{{Main|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|Genetics of aging}}
Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of [[stem cell]]s and [[tissue engineering]], [[telomere]]-lengthening machinery, [[allotopic expression]] of [[mitochondrial]] proteins, targeted ablation of cells, [[immunotherapy|immunotherapeutic]] clearance, and novel [[lysosome|lysosomal]] [[hydrolases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |author2=Michael Rae |title=[[Ending Aging|Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2007 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-312-36706-0 |oclc=132583222}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic editing===
{{Main|Genome editing}}
[[Genome editing]], in which [[nucleic acid]] polymers are delivered as a [[Biologic medical product|drug]] and are either [[gene expression|expressed]] as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Neuroendocrinology of Aging: The Potential of Gene Therapy as an Interventive Strategy |journal=Gerontology |date=2001-01-08 |first=Rodolfo G. |last=Goya |author2=Federico Bolognani |author3=Claudia B.

A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in [[nematode]] worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks1155| pmid = 23193293| pmc = 3531213| title = Human Ageing Genomic Resources: Integrated databases and tools for the biology and genetics of ageing| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 41| issue = Database issue| pages = D1027–33| year = 2012| last1 = Tacutu | first1 = R.| last2 = Craig | first2 = T.| last3 = Budovsky | first3 = A.| last4 = Wuttke | first4 = D.| last5 = Lehmann | first5 = G.| last6 = Taranukha | first6 = D.| last7 = Costa | first7 = J.| last8 = Fraifeld | first8 = V.

===Fooling genes===
In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes an approach to life-extension that involves "fooling genes" into thinking the body is young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | pages = 41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to [[Peter Medawar]]. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |origyear=1976|year=2006 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind uploading===
{{Main|Mind uploading}}
One hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest,{{who|date=July 2017}} "eliminates" the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Anders|last=Sandberg| author1-link=Anders Sandberg|first2=Nick|last2=Boström| author2-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap|quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.''|url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2013|series= Technical Report #2008‐3|year=2008| publisher = Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not an exact copy of one's mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.

===Young blood injection===

'''Metanoia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μετάνοια}}, ''metanoia'', "changing one's mind") has been used in psychology since at least the time of American thinker [[William James]] to describe a process of fundamental change in the human personality.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] words μετά ([[Meta|''metá'']]) (meaning "beyond" or "after") and  νόος ([[Nous|''noeō'']]) (meaning "perception" or "understanding" or "mind"), and takes on different meanings in different contexts.

==Developments==
William James used the term metanoia to refer to a fundamental and stable change in an individual's life-orientation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Carl Gustav Jung]] developed the usage to indicate a spontaneous attempt of the psyche to heal itself of unbearable conflict by melting down and then being reborn in a more adaptive form – a form of self healing often associated with the [[mid-life crisis]] and psychotic breakdown, which can be viewed as a potentially productive process.&lt;ref&gt;R. Arp. ''1001 Ideas That Changed the Way We Think'' (2013) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered that psychotic episodes in particular could be understood as an [[existential crisis]] which might be an attempt at self-reparation: in such instances metanoia could represent a shift in the balance of the personality away from the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] towards the [[Shadow (Jung)|shadow]] and the self.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung's concept of metanoia influenced [[R. D. Laing]] and his emphasis on the dissolution and replacement of everyday ego consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Leeming et al, ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (2010) p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; Laing's colleague, [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]], considered that "metanoia means change from the depths of oneself upwards into the ''superficies'' of one's social appearance" – a process that in the second of its three stages "generates the 'signs' of depression and mourning".&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (1974) p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly influenced was the [[therapeutic community]] movement. Ideally, it aimed to support people whilst they broke down and went through spontaneous healing, rather than thwarting such efforts at self-repair by strengthening a person's existing character defences and thereby maintaining the underlying conflict.

In [[transactional analysis]], metanoia is used to describe the experience of abandoning an old scripted self or [[false self]] for a more open one: a process which may be marked by a mixture of intensity, despair, self-surrender, and an encounter with the inner void.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 63-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]], '''missional living''' is the adoption of the posture, thinking, behaviors, and practices of a [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]] in order to engage others with the [[Good news (Christianity)|gospel]] message. The missional church movement, a [[church renewal]] movement predicated on the necessity of missional living by Christians, gained popularity at the end of the twentieth century due to advocates like [[Timothy J. Keller|Tim Keller]] and others in the Gospel and Our Culture Network.  Advocates contrast missional living with the concept of a select group of "professional" missionaries, emphasizing that all Christians should be involved in the [[Great Commission]] of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Keller, "The Missional church by Tim Keller" http://download.redeemer.com/pdf/learn/resources/Missional_Church-Keller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Understanding ''Missional''==
The missional living concept is rooted in the ''[[Missio dei]]'' (Latin, "the sending of God"). In 1934, Karl Hartenstein, a German [[Missiology|missiologist]], coined the phrase in response to [[Karl Barth]] and his emphasis on ''actio Dei'' ("the action of God"). In their view, missional activities stemming from God.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, David J, Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1991), 420.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Triune God is the primary acting agent in the world and within the church.

According to Lesslie Newbigin and Jesus' statements in the Gospel according to John, every Christian has been sent by Jesus with the gospel together in community to those in the surrounding culture for the sake of the King and His kingdom: “The Church is sent into the world to continue that which he came to do, in the power of the same Spirit, reconciling people to God.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Lesslie Newbigin]], ''The Gospel in a Pluralist Society'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1989, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus said, “As the Father has sent Me, I am sending you” (John 20:21).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"No one can say: ‘Since I’m not called to be a missionary, I do not have to evangelize my friends and neighbors.’ There is no difference, in spiritual terms, between a missionary witnessing in his home town and a missionary witnessing in Katmandu, Nepal. We are all called to go—even if it is only to the next room, or the next block.”"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hale, ''On Being a Missionary'', p 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==A missional (missionary) perspective==
''Missional living'' is the embodiment of the mission of Jesus in the world by incarnating the gospel. "It is imperative that Christians be like Jesus, by living freely within the culture as missionaries who are as faithful to the Father and his gospel as Jesus was in his own time and place."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]], ''The Radical Reformission'', Zondervan, 2004, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This embodiment of the gospel is often referred to as "contextualization" or "inculturation."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Both refer to more than a simple translation of the gospel into different languages and cultures in the way that one translates a history book or a science text. Rather, they point to the embodiment of the living Word in human culture and social settings in such a way that its divine nature and power are not lost. True contextualization is more than communication. It is God working in the hearts of people, making them new and forming them into a new community. It is his Word transforming their lives, their societies, their cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hiebert and Eliose Hiebert Meneses, ''Incarnational Ministry'', Baker Book House, 1995, 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These five biblical distinctives form the foundation of a missional perspective:&lt;ref&gt;Dave DeVries, ''Missional Transformation: Fueling Missionary Movements that Transform America'', Bakke Graduate University, 2007, 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Church is sent by Jesus Christ (John 17:18; 20:21, Luke 9:2; Matt 28: 19–20; Acts 1:8)
# The Church is sent with the Cross (1 Cor 1:18, Eph 2:16, Col 2:14, 1 Pet2:24, 2 Cor 5:17–24)
# The Church is sent in Community (Acts 2:42–47; 5:42; John 13:34–35; 1 John 3:16–17)
# The Church is sent to every Culture (John 1:14; Matt 20:28; Acts 17:22–34; Luke 5:29)
# The Church is sent for the King and His Kingdom (Matt 10:7; 25:34; Luke 4:43; Rev 11:15–17; Jer 10:7; John 18:36)

[[Image:A Missional Perspective.JPG]]

===Sent===
Jesus sent His disciples on a mission. The missional church defines itself in terms of its mission—being sent ones who take the gospel to and incarnate the gospel within a specific culture. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Jesus was the first apostle. He was sent by his Father. He, in turn, sent the Twelve. They went to people who would then take the gospel to the rest of the world. Whoever received it would understand that they, too, had been sent. With the gospel being what it is, the church as bearer of the gospel is bound to be apostolic."&lt;ref&gt;Jim Petersen and Mike Shamy, ''The Insider'', NavPress, 2003, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cross===
Jesus Christ said that He came to earth to seek and to save that which was lost (Luke 19:10). He accomplished salvation through the cross. By dying on the cross, He paid the penalty for sin and satisfied God’s wrath. According to Scripture, without the cross, there is no salvation, no forgiveness, and no hope; because of the cross, there is eternal life. The mission and message of Jesus surround the cross. “For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor 1:18).

===Community===
Jesus loves the Church and He gave His life to redeem the Church. Community exists for Mission! Christians are to bring the gospel ''together'' to the culture. "The church is called to ''do'' the work of Christ, to be the means of his ''action'' in and for the world....Mission, in its widest as well as its more focused senses, is what the church is there for. God intends to put the world to rights; he has dramatically launched this project through Jesus. Those who belong to Jesus are called, here and now, in the power of the Spirit, to be agents of that putting-to-rights purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[[N. T. Wright]], ''Simply Christian'', HarperSanFrancisco, 2006, 201, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
George Peters notes, “If man is to be reached, he must be reached within his own culture.”&lt;ref&gt;George Peters, ''A Biblical Theology of Missions'', Moody Press, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;  This principle is observed when God became a man in the form of Jesus to come to earth and incarnate the gospel. As missionaries sent by Jesus, every Christian must learn to exegete their surrounding culture, uncovering the language, values, and ideas of the culture. Using this information, they take steps to reach people with the gospel message in the context of the surrounding culture.

===King and Kingdom===
The kingdom was central to Jesus’ message and mission. The Book of Acts ends with Paul, under house arrest in Rome, “proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance” (Acts 28:31). Christians are sent to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom so that others may enter the kingdom.
George Hunsberger conveys the idea that the Church is pointing beyond itself to the kingdom of God. The Church is not an end in itself; God has a mission that goes beyond the Church which includes the kingdom. The kingdom and the Church must never be divorced, yet they also must never be equated. In a similar way, “the reign must never be separated from the One who reigns.”&lt;ref&gt;George R. Hunsberger, “Called and Sent to Represent the Reign of God,” in ''Missional Church'', ed. Darrel Guder, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1998, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  The kingdom is always at the heart of the King.

==The missional church==
The missional church movement first arose during the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. The movement seeks to rethink and redefine the nature of the church and create a new paradigm in which churches are seen as missional in nature, instead of attractional in nature. Leaders in the movement argue that instead of churches attempting to attract people to churches through church programs, churches should instead take the gospel outside of the church and engage society with the gospel, often by being involved not only in missions and evangelism but also in social justice movements. The missional church defines itself in terms of its mission — being ''sent ones'' who take the gospel to and incarnate the gospel within a specific cultural context. &lt;blockquote&gt;The church exists, in other words, for what we sometimes call "mission": to announce to the world that Jesus is its Lord.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Wright (theologian)|N. T. Wright]], ''Simply Christian'', 2006, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mission is not just a program of the church. It defines the church as God’s sent people. Either we are defined by mission, or we reduce the scope of the gospel and the mandate of the church. Thus our challenge today is to move from church with mission to missional church."&lt;ref&gt;Guder, ed., ''Missional Church'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Christian church|Church]] has a mission because Jesus has a mission. There is one mission.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Missional church is a community of God’s people that defines itself, and organizes its life around, its real purpose of being an agent of God’s mission to the world. In other words, the church’s true and authentic [[organizing principle]] is mission. When the church is in mission, it is the true church. The church itself is not only a product of that mission but is obligated and destined to extend it by whatever means possible. The mission of God flows directly through every believer and every community of faith that adheres to Jesus. To obstruct this is to block God’s purposes in and through his people."
&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Hirsch]], ''The Forgotten Ways'', Brazos, 2007, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Missional living is a term that is used in contrast with historical institutional churches. Church leaders as well as Christians in general have often regarded the Church as an institution to which outsiders must come in order to receive a certain product, namely, the gospel and all its associated benefits. Institutional churches are sometimes perceived to exist for the members and depend on pastors and staff to evangelize the lost. The "missional church", on the other hand, attempts to take Christ to "the lost" and its members are personally engaged in reaching their communities with the message of Jesus Christ.

The theory of OSR hypothesizes that the operational sex ratio affects the mating competition of males and females in a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/07/06/beheco.ars094.full | title=Measuring mating competition correctly: available evidence supports operational sex ratio theory | authors=Karen de Jong, Elisabet Forsgren, Hanno Sandvik and Trond Amundsen | journal=Behavioral Ecology | year=2012 | doi=10.1093/beheco/ars094 | volume=23 | issue=6 | pages=1170–1177}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is especially useful in the study of [[sexual selection]] since it is a measure of how intense sexual competition is in a species, and also in the study of the relationship of sexual selection to [[sexual dimorphism]].&lt;ref name=Mitani1996&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mitani, J.C. |author2=Gros-louis, J. |author3=Richards, A.F. | year = 1996

 | doi = 10.1086/285888 | jstor=2463187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSR is closely linked to the "potential rate of reproduction" of the two sexes;&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock2007" /&gt; that is, how fast they each could reproduce in ideal circumstances. Usually variation in potential reproductive rates creates bias in the OSR and this in turn will affect the strength of selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balshine- Earn | first1 = Sigal | year = 1996 | title = Reproductive Rates, Operational Sex Ratios, and Mate choice in St. Peter's Fish | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 107–116 | doi=10.1007/s002650050272}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSR is said to be biased toward a particular sex when sexually ready members of that sex are more abundant.  For example, a male-biased OSR means that there are more sexually competing males than sexually competing females.

==Some factors that affect OSR==
The operational sex ratio is affected by the length of time each sex spends in caring for young or in recovering from mating.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T. H. | last2 = Parker | first2 = G. A. | title = Potential Reproductive Rates and the Operation of Sexual Selection | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 437–456 | doi = 10.1086/417793 | year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if females cease mating activity to care for young, but males do not, then more males would be ready to mate, thus creating a male biased OSR. One aspect of gestation and recovery time would be clutch loss. Clutch loss is when offspring or a group of offspring is lost, due to an accident, predation, etc. This, in turn, effects how long reproductive cycles will be in both males and females. If the males were to invest more time in the care of their offspring, they would be spending less time mating. This pushes the population towards a female biased OSR and vice versa. Whether or not it is the males or females investing more care in their offspring, if they were to lose their offspring for whatever reason, this would then change the OSR to be less biased because the once occupied sex becomes available to mate again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prohl | first1 = Heike | year = 2005 | title = Clutch Loss affects the Operational Sex Ratio in the Strawberry Poison Frog Dendrobates pumilio | doi = 10.1007/s00265-005-0915-9 | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 310–315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As aforementioned, another major factor that influences OSR is potential rate of reproduction (PRR). Any sexual differences in the PRR will also change the OSR, so it is important to look at factors that change PRR as well.&lt;ref name= "Gwynne1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gwynne | first1 = D.T. | year = 1990 | title = Testing parental investment and the control of sexual selection: the operational sex ratio | url = | journal = Am.

For example, if males are required to provide a nutrient high gift before mating (most likely food) then when nutrients available is high, the OSR will be male biased because there is plenty of nutrients available to provide gifts. However, if nutrients is low, less males will be ready to reproduce, causing the population to have a female biased OSR.&lt;ref name="Gwynne1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gwynne | first1 = D.T. | last2 = Simmons | first2 = L.W. | year = 1990 | title = Experimental reversal of courtship roles in insects | doi = 10.1038/346172a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 364 | issue = 6280| pages = 172–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = L.W. | year = 1992 | title = Quantification of role reversal in relative parental investment in a brush cricket | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 358 | issue = 6381| pages = 61–63 | doi=10.1038/358061a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kvarnemo | first1 = C. | last2 = Simmons | first2 = L.W. | year = 1999 | title = Variance in female quality, operational sex ratio, and male mate choice in a brushcricket | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 45 | issue = 3–4| pages = 245–252 | doi=10.1007/s002650050559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example would be if, in a certain species, males provided care for offspring and a nest. If the availability of nesting sites decreased, we would see the population trend towards a more female biased OSR because only a small number of males actually have a nest while all the females, regardless of a nest or not, are still producing eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Almada | first1 = V.C. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1995 | title = Courting females: ecological constraints affect sex roles in a natural population of blennild fish Salaria pavo | url = | journal = Anim.

==Some factors that OSR predicts==
A major factor that OSR can predict is the opportunity for sexual selection. As the OSR becomes more biased, the sex that is in excess will tend to undergo more competition for mates and therefore undergo strong sexual selection.&lt;ref name= "Emlen1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "jstor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renolds | first1 = J.D. | year = 1996 | title = Animal breeding systems | url = | journal = Trends Ecol. Evol. | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 68–72 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(96)81045-7| pmid = 21237764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Intensity of competition is also a factor that can be predicted by OSR.&lt;ref name="Kvarnemo1996"/&gt; According to sexual selection theory, whichever sex is more abundant is expected to compete more strongly and the sex that is less abundant is expected to be "choosier" in who they decide to mate with. It would be expected that when an OSR is more biased to one sex than the other, that one would observe more interaction and competition from the sex that is more available to mate. When the population is more female biased, more female-female competition is observed and the opposite is seen for a male population where a male biased would cause more male-male interaction and competitiveness. Though both sexes may be competing for mates, it is important to remember that the biased OSR predicts which sex is the predominant competitor (the sex that exhibits the most competition).&lt;ref name="Gwynne1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colwell1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colwell | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Oring | first2 = L.W. | year = 1988 | title = Sex ratios and intrasexual competition for mates in a sex-role reversed shore bird, Wilson's phalarope | url = | journal = Behav.

As OSR becomes more biased to one sex, it can be observed that mate-guarding will increase. This is likely due to the fact that rival numbers (number of a certain sex that are also ready to mate) are increased. If a population is male biased then there are a lot more rival males to compete for a mate, meaning that those who have a mate already are more likely to guard the mate that they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weir | first1 = L.K. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = The influence of operational sex ratio on the intensity of competition for mates | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 177 | issue = 2| pages = 167–176 | doi=10.1086/657918 | pmid=21460553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further examples of factors that affect OSR==
* Sex in age at maturity is another possible factor that can affect OSR. If it takes one sex longer to mature than the other, it would be expected to see a biased OSR of the sex that matured faster, most of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Pitnick, S. 1993. Operational sex ratio and sperm limitation of Drosophila pachea. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 33. 863-891&lt;/ref&gt;
* Migration schedules differ between sexes which eventually leads to seasonal changes in the OSR. For example, if males arrive first to the migration site, then for a certain amount of time the population would have a male biased OSR.&lt;ref name="colwell1988"/&gt;
* [[Spatial distribution]] can also cause biased in the OSR. So if there is a wide spatial distribution difference between the sexes one would see a biased in the OSR depending on what area was being observed. There might be more males than females in one location causing a male biased OSR in that particular location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kruppa | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Sih | first2 = A. | year = 1993 | title = Experimental studies on water strider mating dynamics: spatial variation in density and sex ratio | doi = 10.1007/bf00171662 | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 107–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnqvist | first1 = G | year = 1992 | title = The effects of operational sex ratio on the relative mating success of extreme male phenotypes in the water strider Gerris odongaster | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 681–683 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)81028-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mortality rate|Mortality]] can also change the OSR of a population. For example, if there is a high mortality rate in males of a specific species one would most likely observe a female biased OSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iwasa | first1 = Y. | last2 = Odendaal | first2 = F.J. | year = 1984 | title = A theory on the temporal pattern of operational sex ratio | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 886–893 | doi=10.2307/1938062| jstor = 1938062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Temperature can play a large part in OSR of a population. In many reptiles, sex determination is dependent on temperature of the environment during embryonic development. Consistently warm or cool environments can result in large biases in sex ratio of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pen | first1 = Ido | last2 = Uller | first2 = Tobias | last3 = Feldmeyer | first3 = Barbara | last4 = Harts | first4 = Anna | last5 = While | first5 = Geoffrey M. | last6 = Wapstra | first6 = Erik | year = 2010 | title = Climate-driven population divergence in sex-determining systems | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7322| pages = 436–439 | doi=10.1038/nature09512 | pmid=20981009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optimism''' is a mental [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] reflecting a belief or hope that the outcome of some specific endeavor, or outcomes in general, will be positive, favorable, and desirable. A common [[idiom]] used to illustrate optimism versus pessimism is [[Is the glass half empty or half full?|a glass filled with water to the halfway point]]: an optimist is said to see the glass as half full, while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty.

The term derives from the Latin ''optimum'', meaning "best". Being optimistic, in the typical sense of the word, is defined as expecting the best possible outcome from any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/optimism|title=Definition of optimism|access-date=November 14, 2017|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115083225/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/optimism|archivedate=November 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually referred to in [[psychology]] as dispositional optimism. It thus reflects a belief that future conditions will work out for the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/optimism|title=optimism - Definition of optimism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234436/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/optimism|archivedate=2014-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of optimism include dispositional models, and models of [[explanatory style]]. Methods to measure optimism have been developed within both theoretical systems, such as various forms of the Life Orientation Test, for the original definition of optimism, or the Attributional Style Questionnaire designed to test optimism in terms of explanatory style.

=== Dispositional optimism ===
[[File:Оптимист и пессимист.jpg|thumb|220px|''An optimist and a pessimist'', [[Vladimir Makovsky]], 1893]]
Researchers [[operationalize]] the term differently depending on their research. As with any trait characteristic, there are several ways to evaluate optimism, such as the Life Orientation Test (LOT).

Dispositional optimism and pessimism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Dispositional optimism and physical well-being: the influence of generalized outcome expectancies on health |last1=Scheier |first1=M. F. |last2=Carver |first2=C.

The LOT returns separate optimism and pessimism scores for each individual. Behaviourally, these two scores correlate around r = 0.5. Optimistic scores on this scale predict better outcomes in relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social relationships and health |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.3399889 |journal=Science |date=1988-07-29 |pages=540–545 |volume=241 |issue=4865 |doi=10.1126/science.3399889 |first=J. |last=House |first2=K. |last2=Landis |first3=D |last3=Umberson}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher [[social status]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Depression and socio-economic risk factors: 7-year longitudinal population study |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/4/293 |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |date=2007-04-01 |issn=0007-1250 |pmid=17401034 |pages=293–298 |volume=190 |issue=4 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.105.020040 |first=Vincent |last=Lorant |first2=Christophe |last2=Croux |first3=Scott |last3=Weich |first4=Denise |last4=Deliège |first5=Johan |last5=Mackenbach |first6=Marc |last6=Ansseau |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151222003929/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/190/4/293 |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced loss of well-being following adversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the self-regulation of behavior |last1=Carver |first1=C.

Some have argued that pessimism and optimism are ends of a single dimension, with any distinction between them reflecting factors such as [[Social desirability bias|social desirability]].  [[Confirmatory factor analysis|Confirmatory modelling]], however, supports a two-dimensional model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Separating optimism and pessimism: A robust psychometric analysis of the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). |url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.4.433 |journal=Psychological Assessment |pages=433–438 |volume=18 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.4.433 |first=Philipp Yorck |last=Herzberg |first2=Heide |last2=Glaesmer |first3=Jürgen |last3=Hoyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two dimensions predict different outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Distinguishing optimism from pessimism in older adults: Is it more important to be optimistic or not to be pessimistic? |url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1345 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |pages=1345–1353 |volume=73 |issue=6 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1345 |first=Susan |last=Robinson-Whelen |first2=Cheongtag |last2=Kim |first3=Robert C. |last3=MacCallum |first4=Janice K. |last4=Kiecolt-Glaser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic modelling confirms this independence, showing that pessimism and optimism are inherited as independent traits, with the typical correlation between them emerging as a result of a general well-being factor and family environment influences.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;

=== Explanatory style ===

[[Explanatory style]] is distinct from dispositional theories of optimism. While related to life-orientation measures of optimism, attributional style theory suggests that dispositional optimism and [[pessimism]] are reflections of the ways people explain events, i.e., that attributions cause these dispositions {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Measures of attributional style distinguish three dimensions among explanations for events: Whether these explanations draw on internal versus external causes; whether the causes are viewed as stable versus unstable; and whether explanations apply globally versus being situationally specific. In addition, the measures distinguish attributions for positive and for negative events.

An optimistic person attributes internal, stable, and global explanations to good things. Pessimistic explanations attribute these traits of stability, globality, and internality to negative events, such as difficulty in relationships.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillham |first1=Jane E. |last2=Shatté |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Reivich |first3=Karen J. |last4=Seligman |first4=Martin E. P. |editor1-last=Chang |editor1-first=Edward C. |title=Optimism and Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |date=2001 |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC |pages=53–75 |isbn=978-1-55798-691-7 |chapter=Optimism, Pessimism, and Explanatory Style}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models of Optimistic and Pessimistic attributions show that attributions themselves are a cognitive style – individuals who tend to focus on the global explanations do so for all types of events, and the styles correlate among each other. In addition to this, individuals vary in how optimistic their attributions are for good events, and on how pessimistic their attributions are for bad events, but these two traits of optimism and pessimism are un-correlated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The structure of attributional style: Cognitive styles and optimism–pessimism bias in the Attributional Style Questionnaire|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914001810|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2014-08-01|pages = 79–85|volume = 66|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2014.03.022|first = Caimei|last = Liu|first2 = Timothy C.|last2 = Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much debate about the relationship between explanatory style and optimism. Some researchers argue that optimism is simply the lay-term for what researchers know as explanatory style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. |last=Peterson |title=The Future of Optimism |journal=American Psychologist |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=44–55 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, it is found that explanatory style is quite distinct from dispositional optimism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Abramson |first2=B. |last2=Dykman |first3=D. |last3=Needles |title=Attributional Style and Theory: Let No One Tear Them Asunder |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=11–13 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0201_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Zullow |title=Explanations and Expectations: Understanding the 'Doing' Side of Optimism |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=45–49 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0201_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two should not be used interchangeably as they are marginally correlated at best. More research is required to "bridge" or further differentiate these concepts.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001" /&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Optimistic Personality.png|thumb|Optimistic Personality (modified from &lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;)]]

As with all psychological traits, differences in both dispositional optimism and pessimism &lt;ref name="Bates2015"/&gt;  and in attributional style  &lt;ref name="Schulman 1993 569–574"&gt;{{cite journal |first = P.|last = Schulman|first2 = D.|last2 = Keith|first3 = M.|last3 = Seligman|title = Is Optimism Heritable?

Both optimism and pessimism are strongly influenced by [[environmental factors]], including family environment.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt; It has been suggested that optimism may be indirectly inherited as a reflection of underlying heritable traits such as [[intelligence]], [[temperament]] and [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="Schulman 1993 569–574"/&gt; Many theories assume optimism can be [[Learned helplessness|learned]],&lt;ref name="Vaughan 2000" /&gt; and research supports a modest role of family-environment acting to raise (or lower) optimism and lower (or raise) [[neuroticism]] and pessimism.&lt;ref name="Bates2015" /&gt;

Work utilising [[brain imaging]] and [[biochemistry]] suggests that at a [[biological trait]] level, optimism and pessimism reflect brain systems specialised for the tasks of processing and incorporating beliefs regarding [[Optimism bias|good and bad information]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Sharot2011"/&gt;

=== Assessment ===

==== Life Orientation Test ====

The Life Orientation Test (LOT) was designed by Scheier and Carver (1985) to assess dispositional optimism – expecting positive or negative outcomes,&lt;ref name="Gillham2001"/&gt; and is one of the more popular tests of optimism and pessimism.

==== Attributional Style Questionnaire ====

This Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ: Peterson et al. 1982 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Christopher |last2=Semmel |first2=Amy |last3=von Baeyer |first3=Carl |last4=Abramson |first4=Lyn Y. |last5=Metalsky |first5=Gerald I. |last6=Seligman |first6=Martin E.

Subjects read a list of six positive and negative events (e.g. "''you have been looking for a job unsuccessfully for some time''"), and are asked to record a possible cause for the event. They then rate whether this is internal or external, stable or changeable, and global or local to the event.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; There are several modified versions of the ASQ including the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire (EASQ), the Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanations (CAVE), and the ASQ designed for testing the optimism of children.&lt;ref name="Gillham2001" /&gt;

=== Associations with health ===

Optimism and [[health]] are correlated moderately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Christopher |last2=Park |first2=Nansook |last3=Kim |first3=Eric S. |title=Can optimism decrease the risk of illness and disease among the elderly? |journal=Aging Health |date=February 2012 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |doi=10.2217/ahe.11.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism has been shown to [[explained variation|explain]] between 5–10% of the variation in the likelihood of developing some health conditions ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]]s between .20 and .30),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peterson |first1=Christopher |last2=Bossio |first2=Lisa M. |editor1-last=Chang |editor1-first=Edward C. |title=Optimism and Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |date=2001 |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-1-55798-691-7 |pages=127–145 |chapter=Optimism and Physical Well-Being}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably including [[cardiovascular disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheier |first1=Michael F. |last2=Matthews |first2=Karen A. |last3=Owens |first3=Jane F. |last4=Magovern |first4=George J. |last5=Lefebvre |first5=R.

The relationship between optimism and health has also been studied with regards to physical symptoms, coping strategies and negative affect for those suffering from [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[asthma]], and [[fibromyalgia]].

It has been found that among individuals with these diseases, optimists are not more likely than pessimists to report pain alleviation due to coping strategies, despite differences in psychological well-being between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Glenn |last1=Affleck |first2=Howard |last2=Tennen |first3=Andrea |last3=Apter |chapter=Optimism, Pessimism, and Daily Life With Chronic Illness |title=Optimism &amp; Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Chang |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2001 |pages=147–168 |isbn=9781557986917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] has confirmed the assumption that optimism is related to psychological well-being: "Put simply, optimists emerge from difficult circumstances with less distress than do pessimists."&lt;ref name="Scheier"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael F. |last=Scheier |first2=Charles S. |last2=Carver |first3=Michael W. |last3=Bridges |chapter=Optimism, Pessimism, and Psychological Well-Being |title=Optimism &amp; Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice |editor-first=E. |editor-last=Chang |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2001 |pages=189–216 |isbn=1-55798-691-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the correlation appears to be attributable to coping style: "That is, optimists seem intent on facing problems head-on, taking active and constructive steps to solve their problems; pessimists are more likely to abandon their effort to attain their goals."&lt;ref name="Scheier" /&gt;

Optimists may respond better to stress: pessimists have shown higher levels of cortisol (the "stress hormone") and trouble regulating cortisol in response to stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Bergland, Christopher. "Optimism Stabilizes Cortisol Levels and Lowers Stress."Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness + Find a Therapist. N.p., n.d. Web. . http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201307/optimism-stabilizes-cortisol-levels-and-lowers-stress.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by Scheier examined the recovery process for a number of patients that had undergone surgery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The study showed that optimism was a strong predictor of the rate of recovery. Optimists achieved faster results in "behavioral milestones" such as sitting in bed, walking around, etc. They also were rated by staff as having a more favorable physical recovery. In a 6-month later follow-up, it was found that optimists were quicker to resume normal activities.

=== Optimism and well-being ===
A number of studies have been done on optimism and psychological well-being. One study conducted by Aspinwall and Taylor (1990) assessed incoming freshmen on a range of personality factors such as optimism, self-esteem, locus of self-control, etc.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheier |first1=Michael F. |last2=Carver |first2=Charles S. |title=Effects of optimism on psychological and physical well-being: Theoretical overview and empirical update |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |date=April 1992 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=201–228 |doi=10.1007/BF01173489}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that freshmen who scored high on optimism before entering college were reported to have lower levels of psychological distress than their more pessimistic peers, while controlling for the other personality factors. Over time, the more optimistic students were less stressed, less lonely, and less depressed than their pessimistic counterparts. Thus, this study suggests a strong link between optimism and psychological well-being.

In addition low optimism may help explain the association between caregivers' anger and reduced sense of vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López|first=J.|last2=Romero-Moreno|first2=R.|last3=Márquez-González|first3=M.|last4=Losada|first4=A.|date=2015-04-01|title=Anger and Health in Dementia Caregivers: Exploring the Mediation Effect of Optimism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smi.2539/abstract|journal=Stress and Health|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=158–165|doi=10.1002/smi.2539|issn=1532-2998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent meta-analysis of optimism supported past findings that optimism is positively correlated with [[life satisfaction]], happiness, psychological and physical well-being and negatively correlated with depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alarcon |first1=Gene M. |last2=Bowling |first2=Nathan A. |last3=Khazon |first3=Steven |title=Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=May 2013 |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=821–827 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to explain the correlation, researchers find that optimists choose healthier lifestyles. For example, optimists smoke less, are more physically active, consume more fruit, vegetables and whole-grain bread, and are more moderate in alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giltay|first1=Erik J.|last2=Geleijnse|first2=Johanna M.|last3=Zitman|first3=Frans G.|last4=Buijsse|first4=Brian|last5=Kromhout|first5=Daan|title=Lifestyle and dietary correlates of dispositional optimism in men: The Zutphen Elderly Study|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=November 2007|volume=63|issue=5|pages=483–490|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.07.014|pmid=17980220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Translating association into modifiability ===

Research to date has demonstrated that optimists are less likely to have certain diseases or develop certain diseases over time. By comparison, research has not yet been able to demonstrate the ability to change an individual's level of optimism through [[psychological intervention]]s, and thereby alter the course of disease or likelihood for development of disease.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Though in that same vein, an article by [[Mayo Clinic]] argues steps to change [[self-talk]] from negative to positive may shift individuals from a negative to a more positive/optimistic outlook.&lt;ref name="MayoTalk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950 | title=Positive thinking: Stop negative self-talk to reduce stress | publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] | date=March 4, 2014 | accessdate=September 18, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916091418/http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/in-depth/positive-thinking/art-20043950 | archivedate=September 16, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies claimed to be of value include surrounding oneself with positive people, identifying areas of change, practicing positive self-talk, being open to humor, and following a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name="MayoTalk"/&gt;

==Philosophical optimism==
&lt;!-- "Philosophical optimism" redirects here --&gt;
Distinct from a disposition to believe that things will work out, there is a philosophical idea that, perhaps in ways that may not be fully comprehended, the present moment is in an optimum state.  This view that all of nature - past, present, and future - operates by laws of optimization along the lines of [[Hamilton's principle]] in the realm of physics is countered by views such as [[idealism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], and philosophical [[pessimism]]. [[Philosophy|Philosopher]]s often link the concept of optimism with the name of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who held that we live in the [[best of all possible worlds]] (''le meilleur des mondes possibles''), or that God created a physical universe that applies the laws of physics. 

Leibniz proposed that it was not in God's power to create a perfect world, but among possible worlds, he created the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire|last=Cronk|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780521849739|location=Cambridge|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his writings, he responded to the [[Blaise Pascal]]'s philosophy of awe and desperation in the face of the infinite by claiming that infinity should be celebrated. While Pascal advocated for making man's rational aspirations more humble, Leibniz was optimistic about the capacity of human reason to further extend itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Studies in Early Modern Philosophy, Volume 8|last=Garber|first=Daniel|last2=Rutherford|first2=Donald|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198829294|location=9780198829294|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was famously mocked by [[Voltaire]] in his satirical novel ''[[Candide]]'' as baseless optimism of the sort exemplified by the beliefs of one of its characters [[Candide#Main characters|Dr. Pangloss]], which are the opposite of his fellow traveller [[Martin (Candide)|Martin]]'s [[pessimism]] and emphasis on [[free will]]. 
The optimistic position is also called [[:wikt:Panglossianism|Panglossianism]] and became an adjective for excessive, even stupendous, optimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Regret: On Collective Memory and Historical Responsibility|last=Olick|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415956833|location=New York|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "panglossian pessimism" has been used{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}} to describe the pessimistic position that, since this is the best of all possible worlds, it is impossible for anything to get any better. Conversely,   philosophical pessimism might be{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}} associated with an optimistic long-term view because it implies that no change for the worse is possible. 
&lt;!--[[William Godwin]] for instance argued that society would eventually reach the state where calm reason would replace all violence and force, that mind could eventually make matter subservient to it, and that intelligence could discover the secret of [[immortality]].{{year needed}}{{page needed}} -- does Godwin make any explicit reference to pessimism?--&gt;

===Optimalism===
&lt;!-- Redirect from optimalism to here --&gt;
Philosophical optimalism, as defined by [[Nicholas Rescher]], holds that this universe exists because it is better than the alternatives.&lt;ref name=Rescher2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Optimalism and axiological metaphysics|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=807–35|issn=0034-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this philosophy does not exclude the possibility of a [[deity]], it also doesn't require one, and is compatible with [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinhart|first=Eric|title=Platonic Atheism|url=http://www.ericsteinhart.com/articles/platonicatheism.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710200257/http://www.ericsteinhart.com/articles/platonicatheism.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological optimalism, as defined by the [[positive psychology|positive psychologist]] [[Tal Ben-Shahar]], means willingness to accept failure while remaining confident that success will follow, a positive attitude he contrasts with negative [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]].&lt;ref name="Pursuit"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tal Ben-Shahar|title=The Pursuit of Perfect: How to Stop Chasing Perfection and Start Living a Richer, Happier Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szotznWmQEYC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=26 July 2011|date=11 March 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-160882-4|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfectionism can be defined as a persistent compulsive drive toward unattainable goals and valuation based solely in terms of accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parker|first=W. D.|last2=Adkins|first2=K. K.|title = Perfectionism and the gifted|journal=Roeper Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=173–176|year=1994|doi=10.1080/02783199509553653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfectionists reject the realities and constraints of human ability. They cannot accept failures, delaying any ambitious and productive behavior in fear of failure again.&lt;ref name="horne1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horne|first=Amanda|title=Positive Psychology News Daily|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/amanda-horne/200909035149|accessdate=July 24, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614124828/http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/amanda-horne/200909035149|archivedate=June 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[neuroticism]] can even lead to [[clinical depression]] and low productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Staff|title=Perfectionism: Impossible Dream|newspaper=Psychology Today|date=May 1995|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19950501-000002.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104131133/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19950501-000002.html|archivedate=2013-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to negative perfectionism, Ben-Shahar suggests the adoption of optimalism. Optimalism allows for failure in pursuit of a goal, and expects that while the trend of activity is towards the positive, it is not necessary to always succeed while striving towards goals. This basis in reality prevents the optimalist from being overwhelmed in the face of failure.&lt;ref name="Pursuit" /&gt;

Optimalists accept failures and also learn from them, which encourages further pursuit of achievement.&lt;ref name="horne1"/&gt; Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar believes that Optimalists and Perfectionists show distinct different motives. Optimalists tend to have more intrinsic, inward desires, with a motivation to learn, while perfectionists are highly motivated by a need to consistently prove themselves worthy.&lt;ref name=Pursuit /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22704">'''Ovarian follicle activation''' can be defined as [[primordial follicles]] in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the [[oocyte]] is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during [[ovulation]]. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called [[folliculogenesis]].

Activation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal [[granulosa cell]]s, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective [[zona pellucida]] layer, and growth of the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braw-Tal|first=Ruth|title=The initiation of follicle growth: the oocyte or the somatic cells?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00699-2|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=187|issue=1-2|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.

== Activation of Primordial Follicle Development ==
Primordial follicles are activated to grow into [[antral follicle]]s. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the [[theca cells]], is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: [[Neurotrophin|Neurotropin]], [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), [[Neurotrophin-4|neurotrophin 4]] (NT4), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-B), [[Growth differentiation factor-9|growth differentiation factor 9]] (GDF9) and [[Bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenic protein]] 15 (BMP15).

=== GDF9 ===
Follicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth.  GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Yeong|date=March 2012|title=Control of ovarian primordial follicle activation|journal=Clinical and Experimental Reproductive Medicine|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–14|doi=10.5653/cerm.2012.39.1.10|issn=2233-8233|pmc=3341446|pmid=22563545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TGF-β ===
As discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/insights-from-animal-reproduction/the-primordial-to-primary-follicle-transition-a-reliable-marker-of-ovarian-function|title=The Primordial to Primary Follicle Transition — A Reliable Marker of Ovarian Function|last=Duda|first=Malgorzata|last2=Grzesiak|first2=Malgorzata|last3=Knet-Seweryn|first3=Malgorzata|last4=Tabarowski|first4=Zbigniew|date=2016|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/62138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Forkhead box L2|Foxl2]] ===
Another molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sohlh1 ===
Spermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Repression of Primordial Follicle Activation==
===[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]===
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor gene]] whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsueh|first=Aaron J. W.|last2=Kawamura|first2=Kazuhiro|last3=Cheng|first3=Yuan|last4=Fauser|first4=Bart C. J. M.|date=February 2015|title=Intraovarian control of early folliculogenesis|journal=Endocrine Reviews|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1210/er.2015.36.issue-1.edboard|issn=1945-7189|pmc=4309737|pmid=25202833}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===[[FOXO3|Foxo3]]===
When Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelosi|first=Emanuele|last2=Omari|first2=Shakib|last3=Michel|first3=Marc|last4=Ding|first4=Jun|last5=Amano|first5=Tomokazu|last6=Forabosco|first6=Antonino|last7=Schlessinger|first7=David|last8=Ottolenghi|first8=Chris|date=2013-05-14|title=Constitutively active Foxo3 in oocytes preserves ovarian reserve in mice|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=4|pages=ncomms2861|doi=10.1038/ncomms2861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation.  The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xinbo|last2=Tang|first2=Naimei|last3=Hadden|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Rishi|first4=Arun K.|date=November 2011|title=Akt, FoxO and regulation of apoptosis|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1813|issue=11|pages=1978–1986|doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3002|pmid=21440011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSC and mTOR===
Tuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of [[mTORC1]] activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Liu|first3=Kui|date=February 2010|title=Mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of mammalian primordial follicles|journal=Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=21|issue=2|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.001|issn=1879-3061|pmid=19913438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Flohr|first2=Gilian|last3=Gorre|first3=Nagaraju|last4=Shen|first4=Yan|last5=Yang|first5=Hairu|last6=Lundin|first6=Eva|last7=Lan|first7=Zijian|last8=Gambello|first8=Michael J.|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=December 2009|title=Disruption of Tsc2 in oocytes leads to overactivation of the entire pool of primordial follicles|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=15|issue=12|pages=765–770|doi=10.1093/molehr/gap092|issn=1460-2407|pmid=19843635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMH===
AMH ([[Anti-Müllerian hormone|Anti-mullerian Hormone]]) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsun-Ming|last2=Klausen|first2=Christian|last3=Leung|first3=Peter C.

===Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27===
P27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=M. B.|date=September 2000|title=P27 in cell cycle control and cancer|journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma|volume=39|issue=1-2|pages=19–27|doi=10.3109/10428190009053535|issn=1042-8194|pmid=10975380}}&lt;/ref&gt; by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Medical Consequences ==

=== Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) ===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary [[amenorrhea]], before the age of 40.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Chevy|last2=Cree|first2=Lynsey|last3=Shelling|first3=Andrew N|date=2015-09-23|title=The genetics of premature ovarian failure: current perspectives|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=7|pages=799–810|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S64024|issn=1179-1411|pmc=4590549|pmid=26445561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated [[atresia]] of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persani|first=Luca|last2=Rossetti|first2=Raffaella|last3=Cacciatore|first3=Chiara|date=November 2010|title=Genes involved in human premature ovarian failure|journal=Journal of Molecular Endocrinology|volume=45|issue=5|pages=257–279|doi=10.1677/JME-10-0070|issn=1479-6813|pmid=20668067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.

[[FOXL2]] - FOXL2 [[knockout mouse]] models showed failure of [[granulosa cell]] differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=S. E.|last2=Chand|first2=A. L.|last3=Winship|first3=I. M.|last4=Gersak|first4=K.|last5=Aittomäki|first5=K.|last6=Shelling|first6=A.

BMP15 and [[Growth differentiation factor-9|GDF9]] - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laissue|first=Paul|last2=Christin-Maitre|first2=Sophie|last3=Touraine|first3=Philippe|last4=Kuttenn|first4=Frederique|last5=Ritvos|first5=Olli|last6=Aittomaki|first6=Kristiina|last7=Bourcigaux|first7=Nathalie|last8=Jacquesson|first8=Laetitia|last9=Bouchard|first9=Philippe|date=May 2006|title=Mutations and sequence variants in GDF9 and BMP15 in patients with premature ovarian failure|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=154|issue=5|pages=739–744|doi=10.1530/eje.1.02135|issn=0804-4643|pmid=16645022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

AMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF [[antral follicle]]s leads to defective antral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Méduri|first=G.|last2=Massin|first2=N.|last3=Guibourdenche|first3=J.|last4=Bachelot|first4=A.|last5=Fiori|first5=O.|last6=Kuttenn|first6=F.|last7=Misrahi|first7=M.|last8=Touraine|first8=P.|date=January 2007|title=Serum anti-Müllerian hormone expression in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Human Reproduction (Oxford, England)|volume=22|issue=1|pages=117–123|doi=10.1093/humrep/del346|issn=0268-1161|pmid=16954410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[mTORC1]] and [[PI3K]] - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Shen|first3=Yan|last4=Gorre|first4=Nagaraju|last5=Hämäläinen|first5=Tuula|last6=Cooney|first6=Austin J.|last7=Huhtaniemi|first7=Ilpo|last8=Lan|first8=Zi-Jian|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=2010-02-01|title=Tsc/mTORC1 signaling in oocytes governs the quiescence and activation of primordial follicles|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–410|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp483|issn=1460-2083|pmc=2798719|pmid=19843540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] - Studies of mice with a deletion in PTEN in the oocytes showed early activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, leading to a lack of primordial follicles in adulthood, resulting in a POF phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Liu|first2=Lian|last3=Adhikari|first3=Deepak|last4=Jagarlamudi|first4=Krishna|last5=Rajareddy|first5=Singareddy|last6=Shen|first6=Yan|last7=Du|first7=Chun|last8=Tang|first8=Wenli|last9=Hämäläinen|first9=Tuula|date=2008-02-01|title=Oocyte-specific deletion of Pten causes premature activation of the primordial follicle pool|journal=Science|volume=319|issue=5863|pages=611–613|doi=10.1126/science.1152257|issn=1095-9203|pmid=18239123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuang|first=Haibin|last2=Zhang|first2=Li|last3=Peng|first3=Jing|last4=Chen|first4=Qi|date=December 2009|title=Premature ovarian failure, menopause and ovarian cancer, three nodes on the same string: Pten and other potential genes on the go|journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|volume=73|issue=6|pages=961–962|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.023|issn=1532-2777|pmid=19733443}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

[[FOXO3|Foxo3a]] - Studies into mice with complete and partial Foxo3a deletions also showed premature activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, destroying the ovarian reserve and leading to oocyte death. This led to a POF phenotype, seen in studies in a range of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=Wendy J.|last2=Umbers|first2=Alexandra J.|last3=Woad|first3=Kathryn J.|last4=Harris|first4=Sarah E.|last5=Winship|first5=Ingrid M.|last6=Gersak|first6=Ksenija|last7=Shelling|first7=Andrew N.|date=November 2006|title=Mutational screening of FOXO3A and FOXO1A in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1518–1521|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.03.054|issn=1556-5653|pmid=16979636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Binbin|last2=Mu|first2=Yuan|last3=Ni|first3=Feng|last4=Zhou|first4=Sirui|last5=Wang|first5=Jing|last6=Cao|first6=Yunxia|last7=Ma|first7=Xu|date=April 2010|title=Analysis of FOXO3 mutation in 114 Chinese women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=20|issue=4|pages=499–503|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2010.01.008|issn=1472-6491|pmid=20219431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSC - In the oocytes of [[TSC2|Tsc2]] knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"/&gt;

=== [[Chemotherapy]] and Ovarian Follicle Activation ===

As well as having many genetic causes, [[premature ovarian failure]] has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalich-Philosoph|first=Lital|last2=Roness|first2=Hadassa|last3=Carmely|first3=Alon|last4=Fishel-Bartal|first4=Michal|last5=Ligumsky|first5=Hagai|last6=Paglin|first6=Shoshana|last7=Wolf|first7=Ido|last8=Kanety|first8=Hannah|last9=Sredni|first9=Benjamin|date=2013-05-15|title=Cyclophosphamide triggers follicle activation and "burnout"; AS101 prevents follicle loss and preserves fertility|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=5|issue=185|pages=185ra62|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3005402|issn=1946-6242|pmid=23677591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]], and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as [[alkylating agents]], seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:
# By direct damage to the primordial follicle, causing cell death by toxicity
# By indirect damage to the [[stromal cell]]s which surround the follicle and support it, to allow it to grow. Loss of these supporting cells then leads to death of the follicle.
Chemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.

===[[Oocyte cryopreservation]]===

Oocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnez|first=Jacques|last2=Dolmans|first2=Marie-Madeleine|last3=Pellicer|first3=Antonio|last4=Diaz-Garcia|first4=Cesar|last5=Sanchez Serrano|first5=Maria|last6=Schmidt|first6=Kristen Tryde|last7=Ernst|first7=Erik|last8=Luyckx|first8=Valérie|last9=Andersen|first9=Claus Yding|date=May 2013|title=Restoration of ovarian activity and pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue: a review of 60 cases of reimplantation|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=99|issue=6|pages=1503–1513|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.030|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23635349}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several methods of [[cryopreservation]], each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.

=== Restoration of Ovarian Activity after Cryopreservation ===

Restoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in [[oestrogen]], a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Phenomenological life''' ({{lang-fr|vie phénoménologique}}) is life considered from a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and rigorously [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] point of view. The relevant philosophical project is called "'''radical  phenomenology of life'''" (''phénoménologie radicale de la vie'') or "'''material phenomenology of life'''" (''phénoménologie matérielle de la vie'').

The philosopher [[Michel Henry]] defines life from a phenomenological point of view as that which possesses the faculty and the power "of feeling and experiencing oneself in each point of its being".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 15, 23 et 80&lt;/ref&gt;

For Michel Henry, life is essentially subjective force and [[affectivity]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, cover page&lt;/ref&gt; — it consists of a pure subjective experience of oneself which perpetually oscillates between [[suffering]] and [[joy]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; A "subjective force" is not an impersonal, blind and insensitive [[force]] like the objective forces we meet in nature, but a living and sensible force experienced from within and resulting from an inner desire and a subjective effort of the will to satisfy it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Voir l’invisible, éd. François Bourin, 1988, pp. 211-212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 138 et 218&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from this phenomenological approach to life, in ''Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair (Incarnation, a Philosophy of the Flesh)''&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body, which is in principle insensible.

The word "phenomenological" refers to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], which is the study of phenomena and a philosophical method which fundamentally concerns the study of phenomena as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; What Henry calls "absolute phenomenological life" is the subjective life of individuals reduced to its pure inner manifestation, as we perpetually live it and feel it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, La Barbarie, éd. Grasset, 1987, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 46-70&lt;/ref&gt; It is life as it reveals itself and appears inwardly, its self-revelation: life is both what reveals and what is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, éd. du Seuil, 1996, pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

Life is by nature invisible because it never appears in the exteriority of a look; it reveals itself in itself without gap or distance. The fact of seeing does in effect presuppose the existence of a distance and of a separation between what is seen and the one who sees, between the object that is perceived and the subject who perceives it. A feeling, for example, can never be seen from the exterior, it never appears in the "horizon of visibility" of the world; it feels itself and experiences itself from within in the radical immanence of life. Love cannot see itself, any more than hatred; feelings are felt in the secrecy of our hearts, where no look can penetrate. 

Life is constituted of sensitivity and affectivity — it is the unity of their manifestation, affectivity being however the essence of sensibility (as Henry shows in ''The Essence of Manifestation'') which means that every sensation is affective by nature. Phenomenological life is the foundation of all our subjective experiences (like the subjective experience of a sorrow, of seeing a color or the pleasure of drinking fresh water in summer) and of each of our subjective powers (the subjective power of moving the hand or the eyes, for example).

In ''Incarnation, a philosophy of the flesh'', Henry establishes a radical opposition between the living flesh endowed with sensibility and the material body which is as a matter of principle insensitive.

== Phenomenological vs. biological ==

This phenomenological definition of life is founded, then, in the concrete subjective experience we have of life in our own existence. It thus corresponds to human life. In ''I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'', Michel Henry writes about the other forms of life studied by biology and from which [[Heidegger]] derives his own philosophical conception of life: "Is it not paradoxical for anyone who wants to know what life is to go and ask protozoa or, in the best case, honeybees? As if our only relation with life was a wholly external and fragile relation with beings about whom we know nothing – or so very little! As if we ourselves were not living beings!"&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''I am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'' (§ 3, p. 47)&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition, however, fails to include living organisms that cannot experience themselves, such as plant life — unless one can find evidence of the existence of a certain kind of sensibility in them, as Professor A. Tronchet appears to suggest in his book ''La sensibilité des plantes (Plant Sensibility)'': "The protoplasm of plant cells, like that of animal cells, is endowed with irritability, i.e. a particular form of sensibility, thanks to which it is capable of being affected by excitations originating externally or internally".&lt;ref&gt;A. Tronchet, La sensibilité des plantes, Masson, 1977, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Truth of Life ==

Michel Henry explains in ''C’est Moi la Vérité. Pour une philosophie du christianisme (I am the Truth. Towards a Philosophy of Christianity)'' what Christianity considers to be the Truth and which he calls "the Truth of Life".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 32-45.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that the Christian concept of Truth is opposed to what men habitually consider to be the truth, which originates in Greek thought and which he calls "the truth of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 21-31&lt;/ref&gt; But what is truth? Truth is what shows itself and thus demonstrates its reality in its effective manifestation in us or in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 19-22&lt;/ref&gt; 

The truth of the world designates an external and objective truth, a truth in which everything appears to our gaze in the form of a visible object at a distance from us, i.e. in the form of a representation which is distinct from what it shows:&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 25-31.&lt;/ref&gt; when we look at an apple, it is not the apple in itself that we see but a mere image of the apple that appears in our sensibility and which changes depending on the lighting or the angle from which we view it. In the same way, when we look at a person's face, it is not the person in herself that we see, but only an image of her face, her visible appearance in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt; According to this way of conceiving truth, life is nothing more than a set of objective properties characterised (for example) by the need to feed oneself or one's aptitude for reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 58-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian thought==

In Christianity, Life is reduced to its internal reality, which is absolutely subjective and radically immanent.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Considered in its phenomenological reality, Life is quite simply the faculty and the subjective ability to feel sensations, small pleasures or great hurts, to experience desires and feelings, to move our bodies from within by exerting subjective effort, or even to think.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, Incarnation, éd. du Seuil, 2000, pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; All such faculties possess the fundamental characteristic of appearing and manifesting themselves in themselves, with no gap or distance; we do not perceive them from outside our being or as present to our gaze, but only in us: we coincide with each of these abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; Life is in itself the power of manifestation and revelation, and what it manifests is itself, in its feeling self-revelation&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 36-37 et 73&lt;/ref&gt; — it is a power of revelation which is perpetually at work within us and which we continually forget.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truth of Life is ''absolutely'' subjective — that is, it is independent of our subjective beliefs and tastes. The perception of a coloured sensation or a pain, for example, is not a matter of personal preference but a fact and an incontestable inner experience which pertains to the ''absolute'' subjectivity of Life.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, pp. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt; The Truth of Life does not therefore differ in any way from that which it makes true, it is not distinct from that which manifests itself in it.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Truth is manifestation itself in its pure inner revelation, and Life is what Christianity calls God.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truth of Life is not a relative truth which varies from one individual to another, but absolute Truth which is the inner foundation of each of our faculties and abilities, and which illuminates the least of our impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The Truth of Life is not an abstract and indifferent truth; on the contrary, it is that which is most essential for man, as it is this alone that can lead him to salvation in his inner identification with it and in becoming the Son of God, rather than losing himself in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, C'est moi la Vérité, Éditions du Seuil, 1996, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
A '''phylogenetic tree''' or '''evolutionary tree''' is a branching [[diagram]] or "[[tree (graph theory)|tree]]" showing the [[evolution]]ary relationships among various biological [[species]] or other entities—their '''phylogeny''' ({{IPAc-en|f|aɪ|ˈ|l|ɒ|dʒ|ən|i}})—based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic characteristics. All life on Earth is part of a single phylogenetic tree, indicating [[common ancestry]].

In a ''rooted'' phylogenetic tree, each node with descendants represents the inferred [[most recent common ancestor]] of those descendants, and the edge lengths in some trees may be interpreted as time estimates. Each node is called a taxonomic unit. Internal nodes are generally called hypothetical taxonomic units, as they cannot be directly observed. Trees are useful in fields of biology such as [[bioinformatics]], [[systematics]], and [[phylogenetics]]. ''Unrooted'' trees illustrate only the relatedness of the [[leaf nodes]] and do not require the ancestral root to be known or inferred.

==History==
The idea of a "[[tree of life (science)|tree of life]]" arose from ancient notions of a ladder-like progression from lower into higher forms of [[life]] (such as in the [[Great Chain of Being]]). Early representations of "branching" phylogenetic trees include a "paleontological chart" showing the geological relationships among plants and animals in the book ''Elementary Geology'', by Edward Hitchcock (first edition: 1840).

[[Charles Darwin]] (1859) also produced one of the first illustrations and crucially popularized the notion of an [[Natural selection|evolutionary "tree"]] in his seminal book ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. Over a century later, [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]]s still use [[Tree structure|tree diagram]]s to depict [[evolution]] because such diagrams effectively convey the concept that [[speciation]] occurs through the [[Adaptation|adaptive]] and semi[[random]] splitting of lineages. Over time, species classification has become less static and more dynamic.

The term ''phylogenetic'', or ''phylogeny'', derives from the two [[ancient greek]] words {{wikt-lang|grc|φῦλον}} ({{grc-transl|φῦλον}}), meaning "race, lineage", and {{wikt-lang|grc|γένεσις}} ({{grc-transl|γένεσις}}), meaning "origin, source".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/461974285 |title=Abrégé du dictionnaire grec français |last=Bailly |first=Anatole |date=1981-01-01 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=978-2010035289 |location=Paris |oclc=461974285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |title=Greek-french dictionary online |last=Bailly |first=Anatole |date= |website=www.tabularium.be |publisher= |access-date=March 2, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421003247/http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |archivedate=April 21, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Rooted tree===
A rooted phylogenetic tree (see two graphics at top) is a [[directed graph|directed]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]] with a unique node — the root — corresponding to the (usually [[imputation (statistics)|imputed]]) most recent common ancestor of all the entities at the [[leaf node|leaves]] of the tree. The root node does not have a parent node, but serves as the parent of all other nodes in the tree. The root is therefore a node of [[Node (computer science)#Nodes and trees|degree]] 2 while other internal nodes have a minimum degree of 3 (where "degree" here refers to the total number of incoming and outgoing edges).

The most common method for rooting trees is the use of an uncontroversial [[outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]]—close enough to allow inference from trait data or molecular sequencing, but far enough to be a clear outgroup.

===Unrooted tree===
[[Image:MyosinUnrootedTree.jpg|thumb|340px|An unrooted phylogenetic tree for [[myosin]], a [[gene family|superfamily]] of [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=Hodge_2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hodge T, Cope M|title=A myosin family tree|journal=J Cell Sci|volume=113|issue=19|pages=3353–4|date=1 October 2000|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/113/19/3353|pmid=10984423|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043742/http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/113/19/3353|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Unrooted trees illustrate the relatedness of the leaf nodes without making assumptions about ancestry. They do not require the ancestral root to be known or inferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/NAWBIS/Modules/Phylogenetics/phylo9.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414030413/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/NAWBIS/Modules/Phylogenetics/phylo9.html |archivedate=2014-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrooted trees can always be generated from rooted ones by simply omitting the root. By contrast, inferring the root of an unrooted tree requires some means of identifying ancestry. This is normally done by including an outgroup in the input data so that the root is necessarily between the outgroup and the rest of the taxa in the tree, or by introducing additional assumptions about the relative rates of evolution on each branch, such as an application of the [[molecular clock]] [[hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=Maher_2002&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maher BA|title=Uprooting the Tree of Life|journal=The Scientist|volume=16|pages=18|year=2002|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2002/sep/research1_020916.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002231607/http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2002/sep/research1_020916.html|archivedate=2003-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bifurcating tree===
Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be either [[bifurcation theory|bifurcating]] or multifurcating, and either labeled or unlabeled. A rooted bifurcating tree has exactly two descendants arising from each [[interior node]] (that is, it forms a [[binary tree]]), and an unrooted bifurcating tree takes the form of an [[unrooted binary tree]], a [[free tree]] with exactly three neighbors at each internal node. In contrast, a rooted multifurcating tree may have more than two children at some nodes and an unrooted multifurcating tree may have more than three neighbors at some nodes. A labeled tree has specific values assigned to its leaves, while an unlabeled tree, sometimes called a tree shape, defines a topology only. The number of possible trees for a given number of leaf nodes depends on the specific type of tree, but there are always more multifurcating than bifurcating trees, more labeled than unlabeled trees, and more rooted than unrooted trees. The last distinction is the most biologically relevant; it arises because there are many places on an unrooted tree to put the root. For labeled bifurcating trees, there are:
:&lt;math&gt;
(2n-3)!! = \frac{(2n-3)!}{2^{n-2}(n-2)!} \, \,\text{for}\,n \ge 2
&lt;/math&gt;
total rooted trees and
:&lt;math&gt;
(2n-5)!! = \frac{(2n-5)!}{2^{n-3}(n-3)!} \, \,\text{for}\,n \ge 3
&lt;/math&gt;
total unrooted trees, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of leaf nodes. Among labeled bifurcating trees, the number of unrooted trees with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; leaves is equal to the number of rooted trees with &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; leaves.&lt;ref name="Felsenstein"&gt;Felsenstein J. (2004). ''Inferring Phylogenies'' Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
{{Main|Computational phylogenetics}}
Phylogenetic trees composed with a nontrivial number of input sequences are constructed using [[computational phylogenetics]] methods. Distance-matrix methods such as [[neighbor-joining]] or [[UPGMA]], which calculate [[genetic distance]] from [[multiple sequence alignment]]s, are simplest to implement, but do not invoke an evolutionary model. Many sequence alignment methods such as [[ClustalW]] also create trees by using the simpler algorithms (i.e. those based on distance) of tree construction. [[Maximum parsimony]] is another simple method of estimating phylogenetic trees, but implies an implicit model of evolution (i.e. parsimony). More advanced methods use the [[optimality criterion]] of [[maximum likelihood]], often within a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian Framework]], and apply an explicit model of evolution to phylogenetic tree estimation.&lt;ref name="Felsenstein" /&gt; Identifying the optimal tree using many of these techniques is [[NP-hard]],&lt;ref name="Felsenstein" /&gt; so [[heuristic]] search and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods are used in combination with tree-scoring functions to identify a reasonably good tree that fits the data.

Tree-building methods can be assessed on the basis of several criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Penny | first1 = D. | last2 = Hendy | first2 = M. D. | last3 = Steel | first3 = M. A. | author3-link=Mike Steel (mathematician) | year = 1992 | title = Progress with methods for constructing evolutionary trees | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 73–79 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(92)90244-6| pmid = 21235960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* efficiency (how long does it take to compute the answer, how much memory does it need?)
* power (does it make good use of the data, or is information being wasted?)
* consistency (will it converge on the same answer repeatedly, if each time given different data for the same model problem?)
* robustness (does it cope well with violations of the assumptions of the underlying model?)
* falsifiability (does it alert us when it is not good to use, i.e. when assumptions are violated?)

Tree-building techniques have also gained the attention of mathematicians. Trees can also be built using [[T-theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Dress, K. T. Huber, and V. Moulton. 2001. Metric Spaces in Pure and Applied Mathematics. ''Documenta Mathematica'' ''LSU 2001'': 121-139&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Although phylogenetic trees produced on the basis of sequenced [[gene]]s or [[genome|genomic]] data in different species can provide evolutionary insight, they have important limitations.

In fact, they are literally scientific [[hypotheses]], subject to [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by further study (e.g., gathering of additional data, analyzing the existing data with improved methods).

Also, there are problems in basing the analysis on a single type of character, such as a single [[gene]] or [[protein]] or only on morphological analysis, because such trees constructed from another unrelated data source often differ from the first, and therefore great care is needed in inferring phylogenetic relationships among species. This is most true of genetic material that is subject to lateral gene transfer and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], where different [[haplotype]] blocks can have different histories. In general, the output tree of a phylogenetic analysis is an estimate of the ''character'''s phylogeny (i.e. a gene tree) and not the phylogeny of the [[taxa]] (i.e. species tree) from which these characters were sampled, though ideally, both should be very close. For this reason, serious phylogenetic studies generally use a combination of genes that come from different genomic sources (e.g., from mitochondrial or plastid vs. nuclear genomes), or genes that would be expected to evolve under different selective regimes, so that [[homoplasy]] (false [[homology (biology)|homology]]) would be unlikely to result from natural selection.

When extinct species are included in a tree, they are [[leaf node|terminal node]]s, as it is unlikely that they are direct ancestors of any extant species. Skepticism might be applied when extinct species are included in trees that are wholly or partly based on DNA sequence data, because little useful "[[ancient DNA]]" is preserved for longer than 100,000 years, and except in the most unusual circumstances no DNA sequences long enough for use in phylogenetic analyses have yet been recovered from material over 1 million years old.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The range of useful DNA materials has expanded with advances in extraction and sequencing technologies. Development of technologies able to infer sequences from smaller fragments, or from spatial patterns of DNA degradation products, would further expand the range of DNA considered useful.

In some organisms, [[endosymbiont]]s have an independent genetic history from the host.

[[Phylogenetic network]]s are used when bifurcating trees are not suitable, due to these complications which suggest a more [[reticulate]] evolutionary history of the organisms sampled.

The mechanisms of '''reproductive isolation''' are a collection of [[evolution]]ary mechanisms, [[ethology|behaviors]] and [[physiology|physiological processes]] critical for [[speciation]]. They prevent members of different [[species]] from producing [[offspring]], or ensure that any offspring are sterile. These barriers maintain the integrity of a species by reducing [[gene flow]] between related species.&lt;ref name="T.Baker"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baker | first1=H G | year=1959 | title=Reproductive methods as factors in speciation in flowering plants | url=| journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp quant Biol | volume=24 | issue=| pages=177–191 | doi=10.1101/sqb.1959.024.01.019 | pmid=13796002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.1038/hdy.1986.135 |author1=Barton N. |author2=Bengtsson B.

The mechanisms of reproductive isolation have been classified in a number of ways. Zoologist [[Ernst Mayr]] classified the mechanisms of reproductive isolation in two broad categories: pre-zygotic for those that act before [[fertilization]] (or before [[mating]] in the case of [[animal]]s) and post-zygotic for those that act after it.&lt;ref name="Mayr"&gt;Mayr, E. 1963. ''Animal species and evolution''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms are [[genetics|genetically]] controlled and can appear in species whose geographic distributions overlap ([[sympatric speciation]]) or are separate ([[allopatric speciation]]).

== Pre-zygotic isolation ==
Pre-zygotic isolation mechanisms are the most economic in terms of the [[natural selection]] of a population, as resources are not wasted on the production of a descendant that is weak, non-viable or sterile. These mechanisms include physiological or systemic barriers to fertilization.

=== Temporal or habitat isolation ===
[[File:Reproductive Isolation on California Salamander population.png|thumb|The Central Valley in California prevents two the salamander population from interacting with each other which is a habitat isolation. After many generations the two salamander gene pools will become mutated caused by natural selection. The mutation will change the DNA sequence of the two populations enough that the salamander populations can no longer successfully breed between each other making the populations of salamander become classified as different species.]]
Any of the factors that prevent potentially fertile individuals from meeting will reproductively isolate the members of distinct species.  The types of barriers that can cause this isolation include: different [[habitat]]s, physical barriers, and a difference in the time of [[sexual maturity]] or flowering.&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;Levine, L. 1979. Biología del gen. Ed. Omega, Barcelona. {{ISBN|84-282-0551-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wiens | first1=J | year=2004 | title=Speciation and Ecology Revisited: Phylogenetic Niche Conservatism and the Origin of Species | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=58 | issue=| pages=193–197 | doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01586.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the ecological or habitat differences that impede the meeting of potential pairs occurs in two fish species of the family ''[[Gasterosteidae]]'' (sticklebacks). One species lives all year round in fresh [[water]], mainly in small streams.  The other species lives in the sea during winter, but in spring and summer individuals migrate to river estuaries to reproduce. The members of the two populations are reproductively isolated due to their adaptations to distinct salt concentrations.&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;
An example of reproductive isolation due to differences in the mating season are found in the toad species ''[[Bufo americanus]]'' and ''[[Bufo fowleri]]''. The members of these species can be successfully crossed in the laboratory producing healthy, fertile hybrids. However, mating does not occur in the wild even though the geographical distribution of the two species overlaps. The reason for the absence of [[inter-species mating]] is that ''B. americanus'' mates in early summer and ''B. fowleri'' in late summer.&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;
Certain plant species, such as ''[[Tradescantia canaliculata]]'' and ''[[Tradescantia subaspera|T. subaspera]]'', are sympatric throughout their geographic distribution, yet they are reproductively isolated as they flower at different times of the year. In addition, one species grows in sunny areas and the other in deeply shaded areas.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiens"/&gt;

=== Behavioral isolation ===
The different [[mating|mating rituals]] of animal species creates extremely powerful reproductive barriers, termed sexual or behavior isolation, that isolate apparently similar species in the majority of the groups of the animal kingdom. In [[dioecious]] species, males and females have to search for a partner, be in proximity to each other, carry out the complex mating rituals and finally copulate or release their gametes into the environment in order to breed.&lt;ref name=Wu1995&gt;{{citation

[[File:New Zealand cicada song.ogg|thumb|right|170px|The songs of birds, insects and many other animals are part of a ritual to attract potential partners of their own species. The song presents specific patterns recognizable only by members of the same species, and therefore represents a mechanism of reproductive isolation. This recording is the song of a species of [[cicada]], recorded in [[New Zealand]].]]

Mating dances, the songs of males to attract females or the mutual grooming of pairs, are all examples of typical courtship behavior that allows both recognition and reproductive isolation. This is because each of the stages of courtship depend on the behavior of the partner.  The male will only move onto the second stage of the exhibition if the female shows certain responses in her behavior.  He will only pass onto the third stage when she displays a second key behavior. The behaviors of both interlink, are synchronized in time and lead finally to copulation or the liberation of gametes into the environment.  No animal that is not physiologically suitable for fertilization can complete this demanding chain of behavior.  In fact, the smallest difference in the courting patterns of two species is enough to prevent mating (for example, a specific song pattern acts as an isolation mechanism in distinct species of grasshopper of the genus ''[[Chorthippus]]''&lt;ref name=Perdeck1958&gt;{{citation | last=Perdeck | first= A.C. | year=1958 | title=The Isolating Value of Specific Song Patterns in Two Sibling Species of Grasshoppers (''Chorthippus brunneus'' Thunb. and ''C. biguttulus'' L.) | journal=Behaviour | volume=12 | issue=1–2 | pages=1–75 | doi=10.1163/156853957X00074 | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/beh/1958/00000012/F0020001/art00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Even where there are minimal morphological differences between species, differences in behavior can be enough to prevent mating. For example, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and ''[[Drosophila simulans|D. simulans]]'' which are considered twin species due to their morphological similarity, do not mate even if they are kept together in a laboratory.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;Casares, P. 2008. ''Genética de poblaciones y evolutiva''.  Capítulo 17.  Genética del aislamiento reproductivo. Universidad de Oviedo, España. [http://directo.uniovi.es/catalogo/FichaAsignatura.asp?asignatura=14036]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Drosophila ananassae]]'' and ''D. pallidosa'' are twin species from [[Melanesia]]. In the wild they rarely produce hybrids, although in the laboratory it is possible to produce fertile offspring. Studies of their sexual behavior show that the males court the females of both species but the females show a marked preference for mating with males of their own species. A different regulator region has been found on Chromosome II of both species that affects the selection behavior of the females.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

[[Pheromones]] play an important role in the sexual isolation of insect species.&lt;ref name=Coyne1994&gt;{{citation | last1=Coyne | first1=J.A. | last2=Crittenden | first2=A.P. | last3=Mah | first3=K. | year=1994 | title=Genetics of a pheromonal difference contributing to reproductive isolation in ''Drosophila'' | journal=Science | volume=265 | issue=5177 | pages=1461–1464 | doi=10.1126/science.8073292 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/265/5177/1461 | pmid=8073292
|bibcode=1994Sci...265.1461C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds serve to identify individuals of the same species and of the same or different sex. Evaporated molecules of [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]] pheromones can serve as a wide-reaching chemical signal. In other cases, pheromones may be detected only at a short distance or by contact.

In species of the ''melanogaster'' group of ''Drosophila'', the pheromones of the females are mixtures of different compounds, there is a clear dimorphism in the type and/or quantity of compounds present for each sex. In addition, there are differences in the quantity and quality of constituent compounds between related species, it is assumed that the pheromones serve to distinguish between individuals of each species. An example of the role of pheromones in sexual isolation is found in 'corn borers' in the genus ''[[Ostrinia]]''. There are two twin species in Europe that occasionally cross. The females of both species produce pheromones that contain a volatile compound which has two [[isomer]]s, E and Z; 99% of the compound produced by the females of one species is in the E isomer form, while the females of the other produce 99% isomer Z. The production of the compound is controlled by just one [[locus (genetics)|locus]] and the [[Hybrid (biology)|interspecific hybrid]] produces an equal mix of the two isomers.  The males, for their part, almost exclusively detect the isomer emitted by the females of their species, such that the hybridization although possible is scarce.  The perception of the males is controlled by one [[gene]], distinct from the one for the production of isomers, the [[heterozygous]] males show a moderate response to the odour of either type.  In this case, just 2 'loci' produce the effect of ethological isolation between species that are genetically very similar.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

Sexual isolation between two species can be asymmetrical.  This can happen when the mating that produces descendants only allows one of the two species to function as the female progenitor and the other as the male, while the reciprocal cross does not occur.  For instance, half of the [[wolf|wolves]] tested in the [[Great Lakes]] area of [[United States|America]] show [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequences of [[coyote]]s, while mitochondrial DNA from wolves is never found in coyote populations. This probably reflects an asymmetry in inter-species mating due to the difference in size of the two species as male wolves take advantage of their greater size in order to mate with female coyotes, while female wolves and male coyotes do not mate.&lt;ref name="LEHMAN"&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.2307/2409486 | author=LEHMAN N | last2=Eisenhawer | year=1991 | first2=A. | last3=Hansen | first3=K. | last4=David Mech | first4=L. | last5=Peterson | first5=R.

=== Mechanical isolation ===
[[File:Flores.gif|thumb|The [[flower]]s of many species of ''[[Angiosperm]]'' have evolved to attract and reward a single or a few pollinator species (insects, birds, mammals). Their wide diversity of form, colour, fragrance and presence of nectar is, in many cases, the result of [[coevolution]] with the pollinator species. This dependency on its pollinator species also acts as a reproductive isolation barrier.]]

Mating pairs may not be able to couple successfully if their genitals are not compatible. The relationship between the reproductive isolation of species and the form of their genital organs was signaled for the first time in 1844 by the French [[entomologist]] [[Léon Jean Marie Dufour|Léon Dufour]]. Insects' rigid carapaces act in a manner analogous to a lock and key, as they will only allow mating between individuals with complementary structures, that is, males and females of the same species (termed ''co-specifics'').

Evolution has led to the development of genital organs with increasingly complex and divergent characteristics, which will cause mechanical isolation between species.  Certain characteristics of the genital organs will often have converted them into mechanisms of isolation.  However, numerous studies show that organs that are anatomically very different can be functionally compatible, indicating that other factors also determine the form of these complicated structures.&lt;ref name="patc"&gt;[http://www.cienciahoy.org.ar/hoy32/gemelas.htm Costa, F. 1996. Especies gemelas. Ciencia hoy 6:32 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531183034/http://www.cienciahoy.org.ar/hoy32/gemelas.htm |date=31 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical isolation also occurs in plants and this is related to the adaptation and [[coevolution]] of each species in the attraction of a certain type of pollinator (where [[pollination]] is [[Zoophily|zoophilic]]) through a collection of [[morphology (biology)|morphophysiological]] characteristics of the flowers (called [[Pollination syndrome|floral syndromes]]), in such a way that the transport of [[pollen]] to other species does not occur.&lt;ref name=Grant1994&gt;{{citation | doi=10.1073/pnas.91.1.3 | last=Grant | first= V. | year=1994 | title=Modes and Origins of Mechanical and Ethological Isolation in Angiosperms | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=91 | issue=1 | pages=3–10 | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/91/1/3.pdf
|bibcode=1994PNAS...91....3G | pmc=42875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gametic isolation ===
The synchronous [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] of many species of coral in marine [[reefs]] means that inter-species hybridization can take place as the gametes of hundreds of individuals of tens of species are liberated into the same water at the same time. Approximately a third of all the possible crosses between species are compatible, in the sense that the gametes will fuse and lead to individual hybrids. This hybridization apparently plays a fundamental role in the evolution of coral species.&lt;ref name="RAWSON "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Willis | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Babcock | first2 = R.

It has been observed that in [[sea urchin]]s of the genus ''[[Strongylocentrotus]]'' the concentration of [[spermatocyte]]s that allow 100% fertilization of the ovules of the same species is only able to fertilize 1.5% of the ovules of other species. This inability to produce hybrid offspring, despite the fact that the gametes are found at the same time and in the same place, is due to a phenomenon known as ''gamete incompatibility'', which is often found between marine invertebrates, and whose physiological causes are not fully understood.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = P.

In some ''[[Drosophila]]'' crosses, the swelling of the female's [[vagina]] has been noted following insemination.  This has the effect of consequently preventing the fertilization of the ovule by sperm of a different species.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Patterson, J.T. &amp; Stone, W.S. 1952. Evolution in the genus ''Drosophila''. Macmillan, Nueva York.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|As just described it doesn't follow: it would prevent subsequent insemination by any species, including the female's; and not to prevent initial pre-swelling insemination by a different species.|date=October 2017}}

In plants the pollen grains of a species can germinate in the [[gynoecium|stigma]] and grow in the [[gynoecium|style]] of other species.  However, the growth of the pollen tubes may be detained at some point between the stigma and the ovules, in such a way that fertilization does not take place.  This mechanism of reproductive isolation is common in the [[angiosperm]]s and is called ''cross-incompatibility'' or ''incongruence''.&lt;ref name="Sala"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sala | first1=C.A. | year=1993 | title=Incompatibilidad cruzada entre cinco especies tuberosas de ''Solanum'' (Solanaceae) | url=| journal=Darwiniana | volume=32 | issue=| pages=15–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hogenboom1975&gt;{{citation | last1=Hogenboom | first1=N.G. | last2=Mather | first2=K. | year=1975 | title=Incompatibility and Incongruity: Two Different Mechanisms for the Non-Functioning of Intimate Partner Relationships | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=188 | issue=1092 | pages=361–375 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1975.0025 | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/index/J34304U409014847.pdf | bibcode=1975RSPSB.188..361H }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A relationship exists between self-incompatibility and the phenomenon of cross-incompatibility. In general crosses between individuals of a self-compatible species (SC) with individuals of a self-incompatible (SI) species give hybrid offspring.  On the other hand, a reciprocal cross (SI x SC) will not produce offspring, because the pollen tubes will not reach the ovules. This is known as ''unilateral incompatibility'', which also occurs when two SC or two SI species are crossed.&lt;ref name="Hadley "&gt;Hadley , H.H. &amp; Openshaw, S.J. 1980.

== Post-zygotic isolation ==
A number of mechanisms which act after fertilization preventing successful inter-population crossing are discussed below.

=== Zygote mortality and non-viability of hybrids ===
A type of incompatibility that is found as often in plants as in animals occurs when the egg or [[ovule]] is fertilized but the [[zygote]] does not develop, or it develops and the resulting individual has a reduced viability.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt; This is the case for crosses between species of the [[frog]] genus, where widely differing results are observed depending of the species involved. In some crosses there is no segmentation of the zygote (or it may be that the hybrid is extremely non-viable and changes occur from the first [[mitosis]]). In others, normal segmentation occurs in the [[blastula]] but [[gastrulation]] fails. Finally, in other crosses, the initial stages are normal but errors occur in the final phases of [[embryo development]]. This indicates differentiation of the embryo development genes (or gene complexes) in these species and these differences determine the non-viability of the hybrids.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore, J.A: 1949. Patterns of evolution in the genus ''Rana''. En: ''Genetics, Paleontology and Evolution''. Gepsen, G., Mayr, E. &amp; Simpson, G. (eds). Princeton University Press, pag.: 315-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results are observed in mosquitos of the genus ''[[Culex]]'', but the differences are seen between [[reciprocal cross]]es, from which it is concluded that the same effect occurs in the interaction between the genes of the [[cell nucleus]] (inherited from both parents) as occurs in the genes of the [[cytoplasmic organelles]] which are inherited solely from the female progenitor through the cytoplasm of the ovule.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;

In Angiosperms, the successful development of the embryo depends on the normal functioning of its [[endosperm]].&lt;ref name=Brink1947&gt;{{citation | last1=Brink | first1=R.A. | last2=Cooper | first2=D.C. | year=1947 | title=The endosperm in seed development | journal=The Botanical Review | volume=13 | issue=9 | pages=479–541 | doi=10.1007/BF02861549 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/961M60U76M48R041.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of endosperm development and its subsequent abortion has been observed in many [[interploidy cross|interploidal crosses]] (that is, those between populations with a particular degree of intra or interspecific [[ploidy]]),&lt;ref name="Brink1947"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodell1961&gt;{{citation | last1=Woodell | first1=S.R.J. | last2=Valentine | first2=D.H. | year=1961 | title=Ix.

=== Hybrid sterility ===
[[File:Maultier grau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mule]]s are hybrids with interspecific sterility.]]
A hybrid has normal viability but is typically deficient in terms of reproduction or is sterile. This is demonstrated by the [[mule]] and in many other well known hybrids. In all of these cases sterility is due to the interaction between the genes of the two species involved; to chromosomal imbalances due to the different number of chromosomes in the parent species; or to nucleus-cytoplasmic interactions such as in the case of ''Culex'' described above.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;

[[Hinny|Hinnies]] and mules are [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s resulting from a cross between a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]] or between a mare and a donkey, respectively. These animals are nearly always sterile due to the difference in the number of chromosomes between the two parent species. Both horses and donkeys belong to the genus ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'', but ''Equus caballus'' has 64&amp;nbsp;chromosomes, while ''Equus asinus'' only has 62. A cross will produce offspring (mule or hinny) with 63&amp;nbsp;chromosomes, that will not form pairs, which means that they do not divide in a balanced manner during [[meiosis]]. In the wild, the horses and donkeys ignore each other and do not cross. In order to obtain mules or hinnies it is necessary to train the progenitors to accept copulation between the species or create them through [[artificial insemination]].

The sterility of many interspecific hybrids in [[angiosperms]] has been widely recognised and studied.&lt;ref name=Stebbins1958&gt;{{citation | last=Stebbins | first= G.L. | year=1958 | title=The inviability, weakness, and sterility of interspecific hybrids | journal=Adv Genet | volume=9 | pages=147–215 | doi=10.1016/S0065-2660(08)60162-5 | pmid=13520442}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Interspecific sterility of hybrids in plants has multiple possible causes. These may be genetic, related to the genomes, or the interaction between nuclear and cytoplasmic factors, as will be discussed in the corresponding section. Nevertheless, it is important to note that in plants, hybridization is a stimulus for the creation of new species – the contrary to the situation in animals.&lt;ref name=Anderson1954&gt;{{citation | last1=Anderson | first1=E. | last2=Stebbins | first2=G.L. | year=1954 | title=Hybridization as an Evolutionary Stimulus | journal=Evolution | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=378–388 | doi=10.2307/2405784 | jstor=2405784}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the hybrid may be sterile, it can continue to multiply in the wild by [[asexual reproduction]], whether [[vegetative propagation]] or [[apomixis]] or the production of seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Stebbins, G.L. | first1=G. L. | year=1941 | title=Apomixis in the Angiosperms | journal=The Botanical Review | volume=7 | issue=10 | pages=507–542 | doi=10.1007/BF02872410 | jstor=4353257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell1996&gt;{{citation | last1=Campbell | first1=C.S. | last2=Wright | first2=W.A. | year=1996 | title=Apomixis, hybridization, and taxonomic complexity in eastern north American Amelanchier (Rosaceae) | journal=Folia Geobotanica | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=345–354 | doi=10.1007/BF02815379 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/N38612VR74403183.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, interspecific hybridization can be associated with [[Polyploidy|polyploidia]] and, in this way, the origin of new species that are called [[allopolyploid]]s. ''[[Rosa canina]]'', for example, is the result of multiple hybridizations.&lt;ref name=Ritz2005&gt;{{citation | last1=Ritz | first1=C.

== Multiple mechanisms ==
In general, the barriers that separate species do not consist of just one mechanism.  The twin species of  ''Drosophila'', ''D. pseudoobscura'' and ''D. persimilis'', are isolated from each other by habitat (''persimilis'' generally lives in colder regions at higher altitudes), by the timing of the mating season (''persimilis'' is generally more active in the morning and ''pseuoobscura'' at night) and by behavior during mating (the females of both species prefer the males of their respective species). In this way, although the distribution of these species overlaps in wide areas of the west of the [[United States of America]], these isolation mechanisms are sufficient to keep the species separated. Such that, only a few fertile females have been found amongst the other species among the thousands that have been analyzed. However, when hybrids are produced between both species, the [[gene flow]] between the two will continue to be impeded as the hybrid males are sterile. Also, and in contrast with the great vigor shown by the sterile males, the descendants of the backcrosses of the hybrid females with the parent species are weak and notoriously non-viable. This last mechanism restricts even more the genetic interchange between the two species of fly in the wild.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;

== Hybrid sex: Haldane's rule ==
[[Haldane's rule]] states that when one of the two sexes is absent in interspecific hybrids between two specific species, then the sex that is not produced, is rare or is sterile is the [[heterozygous]] (or heterogametic) sex.&lt;ref name="Haldane "&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Haldane | first1=JBS | year=1922 | title=Sex ratio and unisexual sterility in hybrid animals | url=| journal=J Genet | volume=12 | issue=| pages=101–109 | doi=10.1007/bf02983075}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals, at least, there is growing evidence to suggest that this is due to high rates of mutation of the genes determining masculinity in the [[Y chromosome]].&lt;ref name="Haldane "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Short"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Short | first1=R. V. | year=1997 | title=An Introduction to Mammalian Interspecific Hybrids | url=| journal=Journal of Heredity | volume=88 | issue=| pages=355–357 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a023117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu1993&gt;{{citation | last1=Wu | first1=C.I. | last2=Davis | first2=A.W. | year=1993 | title=Evolution of Postmating Reproductive Isolation: the Composite Nature of Haldane\'s Rule and Its Genetic Bases | journal=American Naturalist | volume=142 | pmid=19425975 | issue=2 | pages=187–212 | doi=10.1086/285534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that Haldane's rule simply reflects the fact that the male sex is more sensitive than the female when the sex-determining genes are included in a hybrid genome. But there are also organisms in which the heterozygous sex is the female: [[bird]]s and [[Butterfly|butterflies]] and the law is followed in these organisms. Therefore, it is not a problem related to sexual development, nor with the sex chromosomes. Haldane proposed that the stability of hybrid individual development requires the full gene complement of each parent species, so that the hybrid of the heterozygous sex is unbalanced (i.e. missing at least one chromosome from each of the parental species). For example, the hybrid male obtained by crossing  ''D. melanogaster'' females with  '' D. simulans'' males, which is non-viable, lacks the X chromosome of '' D. simulans''.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

== Genetics ==

=== Pre-copulatory mechanisms in animals ===
The genetics of [[ethological]] isolation barriers will be discussed first. Pre-copulatory isolation occurs when the genes necessary for the sexual reproduction of one species differ from the equivalent genes of another species, such that if a male of species A and a female of species B are placed together they are unable to copulate. Study of the genetics involved in this reproductive barrier tries to identify the genes that govern distinct sexual behaviors in the two species. The males of  ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and those of  ''D. simulans'' conduct an elaborate courtship with their respective females, which are different for each species, but the differences between the species are more quantitative than qualitative.  In fact the ''simulans'' males are able to hybridize with the  ''melanogaster'' females. Although there are lines of the latter species that can easily cross there are others that are hardly able to. Using this difference, it is possible to assess the minimum number of genes involved in pre-copulatory isolation between the ''melanogaster'' and ''simulans'' species and their chromosomal location.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

In experiments, flies of the ''D. melanogaster'' line, which hybridizes readily with ''simulans'',  were crossed with another line that it does not hybridize with, or rarely.  The females of the segregated populations obtained by this cross were placed next to ''simulans'' males and the percentage of hybridization was recorded, which is a measure of the degree of reproductive isolation. It was concluded from this experiment that 3 of the 8 chromosomes of the [[haploid]] complement of  ''D. melanogaster '' carry at least one gene that affects isolation, such that substituting one chromosome from a line of low isolation with another of high isolation reduces the hybridization frequency. In addition, interactions between chromosomes are detected so that certain combinations of the chromosomes have a multiplying effect.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;
Cross incompatibility or incongruence in plants is also determined by major genes that are not associated at the [[self-incompatibility]] ''S locus''.&lt;ref name=Mutschler1994&gt;{{citation | last1=Mutschler | first1=M.A. | last2=Liedl | first2=B.E. | year=1994 | title=9.

=== Post-copulation or fertilization mechanisms in animals ===
Reproductive isolation between species appears, in certain cases, a long time after fertilization and the formation of the zygote, as happens – for example – in the twin species ''[[Drosophila pavani]]'' and ''[[Drosophila gaucha|D. gaucha]]''. The hybrids between both species are not sterile, in the sense that they produce viable gametes, ovules and spermatozoa. However, they cannot produce offspring as the sperm of the hybrid male do not survive in the semen receptors of the females, be they hybrids or from the parent lines. In the same way, the sperm of the males of the two parent species do not survive in the reproductive tract of the hybrid female.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt; This type of post-copulatory isolation appears as the most efficient system for maintaining reproductive isolation in many species.&lt;ref name=Templeton1981&gt;{{citation | last=Templeton | first= A.R. | year=1981 | title=Mechanisms of Speciation-A Population Genetic Approach | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=12 | issue=1 | pages=23–48 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.12.110181.000323 | url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.es.12.110181.000323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of a zygote into an adult is a complex and delicate process of interactions between genes and the environment that must be carried out precisely, and if there is any alteration in the usual process, caused by the absence of a necessary gene or the presence of a different one, it can arrest the normal development causing the non-viability of the hybrid or its sterility. It should be borne in mind that half of the chromosomes and genes of a hybrid are from one species and the other half come from the other. If the two species are genetically different, there is little possibility that the genes from both will act harmoniously in the hybrid. From this perspective, only a few genes would be required in order to bring about post copulatory isolation, as opposed to the situation described previously for pre-copulatory isolation.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu1994&gt;{{citation | last1=Wu | first1=C. | last2=Palopoli | first2=M.F. | year=1994 | title=Genetics of Postmating Reproductive Isolation in Animals | journal=Annual Review of Genetics | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=283–308 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.28.120194.001435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many species where pre-copulatory reproductive isolation does not exist, hybrids are produced but they are of only one sex. This is the case for the hybridization between females of ''Drosophila simulans'' and ''Drosophila melanogaster'' males: the hybridized females die early in their development so that only males are seen among the offspring. However, populations of ''D. simulans'' have been recorded with genes that permit the development of adult hybrid females, that is, the viability of the females is "rescued". It is assumed that the normal activity of these [[speciation]] genes is to "inhibit" the expression of the genes that allow the growth of the hybrid. There will also be regulator genes.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

A number of these genes have been found in the ''melanogaster'' species group. The first to be discovered was "Lhr" (Lethal hybrid rescue) located in Chromosome II of ''D. simulans''. This [[dominant allele]] allows the development of hybrid females from the cross between ''simulans'' females and ''melanogaster'' males.&lt;ref name=Watanabe1979&gt;{{citation | last=Watanabe | first= T.K. | year=1979 | title=A Gene That Rescues the Lethal Hybrids Between ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and ''D. simulans'' | journal= The Japanese journal of genetics| volume=54 | issue=5 | pages=325–331 | url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.Journalarchive/ggs1921/54.325?from=Google | doi=10.1266/jjg.54.325}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different gene, also located on Chromosome II of ''D. simulans'' is "Shfr" that also allows the development of female hybrids, its activity being dependent on the temperature at which [[Drosophila embryogenesis|development]] occurs.&lt;ref name=Carracedo2000&gt;{{citation | last1=Carracedo | first1=Maria C. | last2=Asenjo | first2=Ana | last3=Casares | first3=Pelayo | year=2000 | title=Location of Shfr, a new gene that rescues hybrid female viability in crosses between ''Drosophila simulans'' females and ''D. melanogaster'' males | journal=Heredity | volume=84 | issue=6 | pages=630–638 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00658.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar genes have been located in distinct populations of species of this group. In short, only a few genes are needed for an effective post copulatory isolation barrier mediated through the non-viability of the hybrids.

As important as identifying an isolation gene is knowing its function. The ''Hmr'' gene, linked to the X chromosome and implicated in the viability of male hybrids between ''D. melanogaster'' and ''D. simulans'', is a gene from the [[proto-oncogene]] family ''[[MYB (gene)|myb]]'', that codes for a transcriptional regulator. Two variants of this gene function perfectly well in each separate species, but in the hybrid they do not function correctly, possibly due to the different genetic background of each species. Examination of the allele sequence of the two species shows that change of direction substitutions are more abundant than [[synonymous substitution]]s, suggesting that this gene has been subject to intense natural selection.&lt;ref name=Hutter1990&gt;{{citation | last1=Hutter | first1=P. | last2=Roote | first2=J. | last3=Ashburner | first3=M. | year=1990 | title=A Genetic Basis for the Inviability of Hybrids Between Sibling Species of ''Drosophila'' | journal=Genetics | volume=124 | issue=4 | pages=909–920 | url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/124/4/909.pdf | pmid=2108905 | pmc=1203982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]]-Muller model proposes that reproductive incompatibilities between species are caused by the interaction of the genes of the respective species. It has been demonstrated recently that ''Lhr'' has functionally diverged in ''D. simulans'' and will interact with ''Hmr'' which, in turn, has functionally diverged in ''D. melanogaster'' to cause the lethality of the male hybrids. ''Lhr'' is located in a heterochromatic region of the genome and its sequence has diverged between these two species in a manner consistent with the mechanisms of positive selection.&lt;ref name=Brideau2006&gt;{{citation | last1=Brideau | first1=Nicholas J. | last2=Flores | first2=Heather A. | last3=Wang | first3=Jun | last4=Maheshwari | first4=Shamoni | last5=Wang | first5=Xu | last6=Barbash | first6=Daniel A. | year=2006 | title=Two Dobzhansky-Muller Genes Interact to Cause Hybrid Lethality in ''Drosophila'' | journal=Science | volume=314 | issue=5803 | pages=1292–1295 | doi=10.1126/science.1133953 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/314/5803/1292 | pmid=17124320|bibcode=2006Sci...314.1292B }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important unanswered question is whether the genes detected correspond to old genes that initiated the speciation favoring hybrid non-viability, or are modern genes that have appeared post-speciation by mutation, that are not shared by the different populations and that suppress the effect of the primitive non-viability genes. The ''OdsH'' (abbreviation of ''Odysseus'') gene causes partial sterility in the hybrid between ''Drosophila simulans'' and a related species, ''D. mauritiana'', which is only encountered on [[Mauritius]], and is of recent origin. This gene shows [[monophyly]] in both species and also has been subject to natural selection. It is thought that it is a gene that intervenes in the initial stages of speciation, while other genes that differentiate the two species show [[polyphyly]].

The ''Nup96'' gene is another example of the evolution of the genes implicated in post-copulatory isolation. It regulates the production of one of the approximately 30 proteins required to form a [[nuclear pore]]. In each of the ''simulans'' groups of ''Drosophila'' the protein from this gene interacts with the protein from another, as yet undiscovered, gene on the X chromosome in order to form a functioning pore. However, in a hybrid the pore that is formed is defective and causes sterility. The differences in the sequences of ''Nup96'' have been subject to adaptive selection, similar to the other examples of  ''speciation genes'' described above.&lt;ref name=Presgraves2003&gt;{{citation | last1=Presgraves | first1=D.C. | last2=Balagopalan | first2=L. | last3=Abmayr | first3=S.M. | last4=Orr | first4=H.A. | year=2003 | title=Adaptive evolution drives divergence of a hybrid inviability gene between two species of ''Drosophila'' | journal=Nature | pmid=12802326 | volume=423 | issue=6941 | pages=715–719 | doi=10.1038/nature01679 | url=http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Speciation/Presgraves_2003.pdf | bibcode=2003Natur.423..715P | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801084253/http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Speciation/Presgraves_2003.pdf | archivedate=1 August 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barbash2007&gt;{{citation| last=Barbash | first= Daniel A. | year=2007 | title=''Nup96''-Dependent Hybrid Lethality Occurs in a Subset of Species from the ''simulans'' Clade of ''Drosophila'' | journal=Genetics | volume=176 | issue=1 | pages=543–52 | doi=10.1534/genetics.107.072827 | url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/176/1/543| pmc=1893067 | pmid=17409061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-copulatory isolation can also arise between chromosomally differentiated populations due to [[chromosomal translocation]]s and [[chromosomal inversion|inversion]]s.&lt;ref name=Noor2001&gt;{{citation | doi=10.1073/pnas.221274498 | last1=Noor | first1=M.A.F. | last2=Grams | first2=K.L. | last3=Bertucci | first3=L.A. | last4=Reiland | first4=J. | year=2001 | title=Chromosomal inversions and the reproductive isolation of species | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=98 | issue=21

This will result in the production of unequal gametes containing unequal numbers of chromosomes with a reduced fertility. In certain cases, complete translocations exist that involve more than two chromosomes, so that the meiosis of the hybrids is irregular and their fertility is zero or nearly zero.&lt;ref name=Rieseberg2001&gt;{{citation | last=Rieseberg | first=L.H. | year=2001 | title=Chromosomal rearrangements and speciation | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=16 | issue=7 | pages=351–358 | doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02187-5 | url=http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Rieseberg_2001.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731100955/http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Rieseberg_2001.pdf | archivedate=31 July 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inversions can also give rise to abnormal gametes in heterozygous individuals but this effect has little importance compared to translocations.&lt;ref name="Noor2001" /&gt; An example of chromosomal changes causing sterility in hybrids comes from the study of ''[[Drosophila nasuta]]'' and ''[[Drosophila albomicans|D. albomicans]]'' which are twin species from the Indo-Pacific region. There is no sexual isolation between them and the [[F1 hybrid]] is fertile. However, the F2 hybrids are relatively infertile and leave few descendants which have a skewed ratio of the sexes. The reason is that the X chromosome of ''albomicans'' is translocated and linked to an [[autosome]] which causes abnormal meiosis in hybrids. [[Robertsonian translocation]]s are variations in the numbers of chromosomes that arise from either: the fusion of two [[centromere|acrocentric]] chromosomes into a single chromosome with two arms, causing a reduction in the haploid number, or conversely; or the fission of one chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes, in this case increasing the haploid number. The hybrids of two populations with differing numbers of chromosomes can experience a certain loss of fertility, and therefore a poor adaptation, because of irregular meiosis.

=== In plants ===
{{further|Reproductive coevolution in Ficus}}

A large variety of mechanisms have been demonstrated to reinforce reproductive isolation between closely related plant species that either historically lived or currently live in [[sympatry]]. This phenomenon is driven by strong selection against hybrids, typically resulting from instances in which hybrids suffer reduced fitness. Such negative fitness consequences have been proposed to be the result of negative [[epistasis]] in hybrid genomes and can also result from the effects of [[hybrid sterility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Taylor | first1=S. | last2=Arnold | first2=M. | last3=Martin | first3=M. | year=2009 | title=The genetic architecture of reproductive isolation in Louisiana irises: Hybrid fitness in nature | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=63 | issue=10| pages=2581–2594 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00742.x | pmid=19549289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, selection gives rise to population-specific isolating mechanisms to prevent either fertilization by interspecific gametes or the development of hybrid embryos.

Because many sexually reproducing species of plants are exposed to a variety of interspecific [[gametes]], natural selection has given rise to a variety of mechanisms to prevent the production of hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kephart | first1=S. | last2=Heiser | first2=C. | year=1980 | title=Reproductive isolation in Asclepias: Lock and Key Hypothesis Reconsidered | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=34 | issue=4| pages=738–746 | doi=10.2307/2408028}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms can act at different stages in the developmental process and are typically divided into two categories, pre-fertilization and post-fertilization, indicating at which point the barrier acts to prevent either zygote formation or development. In the case of [[angiosperms]] and other pollinated species, pre-fertilization mechanisms can be further subdivided into two more categories, pre-pollination and post-pollination, the difference between the two being whether or not a pollen tube is formed. (Typically when pollen encounters a receptive stigma, a series of changes occur which ultimately lead to the growth of a pollen tube down the style, allowing for the formation of the zygote.) Empirical investigation has demonstrated that these barriers act at many different developmental stages and species can have none, one, or many barriers to hybridization with interspecifics.

=== Examples of pre-fertilization mechanisms ===&lt;!--poor choice of section organisation--&gt;

A well-documented example of a pre-fertilization isolating mechanism comes from study of Louisiana iris species.  These iris species were fertilized with interspecific and conspecific pollen loads and it was demonstrated by measure of hybrid progeny success that differences in pollen-tube growth between interspecific and conspecific pollen led to a lower fertilization rate by interspecific pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carney | first1=S. | last2=Hodges | first2=S. | year=1996 | title=Effects of Differential Pollen-tube Growth on Hybridization in Louisiana Irises | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=50 | issue=5| pages=1871–1878 | doi=10.2307/2410745}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates how a specific point in the reproductive process is manipulated by a particular isolating mechanism to prevent hybrids.

Another well-documented example of a pre-fertilization isolating mechanism in plants comes from study of the 2 wind-pollinated birch species. Study of these species led to the discovery that mixed conspecific and interspecific pollen loads still result in 98% conspecific fertilization rates, highlighting the effectiveness of such barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Williams | first1=J. | last2=Friedman | first2=W. | last3=Arnold | first3=M. | year=1999 | title=Developmental selection within the angiosperm style: Using gamete DNA to visualize interspecific pollen competition | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=96 | issue=| pages=9201–9206 | doi=10.1073/pnas.96.16.9201| pmc=17757 | bibcode=1999PNAS...96.9201W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, pollen tube incompatibility and slower generative mitosis have been implicated in the post-pollination isolation mechanism.

=== Examples of post-fertilization mechanisms ===&lt;!--poor choice of section organisation--&gt;

Crosses between diploid and tetraploid species of Paspalum provide evidence of a post-fertilization mechanism preventing hybrid formation when pollen from tetraploid species was used to fertilize a female of a diploid species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Norrmann | first1=G. | last2=Bovo | first2=O. | year=2007 | title=Post-zygotic seed abortion in sexual diploid apomitic tetraploid intra-specific Paspalum crosses | url=| journal=Australian Journal of Botany | volume=42 | issue=4| pages=449–456 | doi=10.1071/bt9940449}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were signs of fertilization and even endosperm formation but subsequently this endosperm collapsed. This demonstrates evidence of an early post-fertilization isolating mechanism, in which the hybrid early embryo is detected and selectively aborted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kinoshita | first1=T | year=2007 | title=Reproductive barrier and genomic imprinting in the endosperm of flowering plants | url=| journal=Genes &amp; Genetic Systems | volume=82 | issue=3| pages=177–86 | doi=10.1266/ggs.82.177}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can also occur later during development in which developed, hybrid seeds are selectively aborted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Emms | first1=S. | last2=Hodges | first2=S. | last3=Arnold | first3=M. | year=1996 | title=Pollen-tube competition; siring success and consistent asymmetric hybridization in Louisiana iries | url=| journal=Evolution | volume=50 | issue=6| pages=2201–2201 | doi=10.2307/2410691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of hybrid necrosis ===
Plant hybrids often suffer from an autoimmune syndrome known as hybrid necrosis. In the hybrids, specific gene products contributed by one of the parents may be inappropriately recognized as foreign and pathogenic, and thus trigger pervasive cell death throughout the plant.&lt;ref name="pmid17404584"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Bomblies K, Weigel D | title=Hybrid necrosis: autoimmunity as a potential gene-flow barrier in plant species | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=8 | issue=5 | pages=382–393 | year=2007 | pmid=17404584 | doi=10.1038/nrg2082| issn=| postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one case, a pathogen receptor, encoded by the most variable gene family in plants, was identified as being responsible for hybrid necrosis.&lt;ref name="pmid17803357"&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Bomblies K, Lempe J, Epple P, Warthmann N, Lanz C, Dangl JL, Weigel D | title=Autoimmune response as a mechanism for a Dobzhansky-Muller-type incompatibility syndrome in plants | journal=PLoS Biol. | volume=5 | issue=9 | pages=e23 | year=2007 | pmid=17803357 | pmc=1964774 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050236| issn=| postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromosomal rearrangements in yeast ===
In brewers' yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', [[chromosomal rearrangement]]s are a major mechanism to reproductively isolate different strains. Hou et al.&lt;ref name="Hou2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid=24814147 | year=2014 | last1=Hou | first1=J. | title=Chromosomal Rearrangements as a Major Mechanism in the Onset of Reproductive Isolation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal=Current Biology| volume=24| issue=10| pages=1153–9| last2=Friedrich| first2=A.| last3=De Montigny| first3=J.| last4=Schacherer| first4=J.| doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that reproductive isolation acts postzygotically and could be attributed to chromosomal rearrangements. These authors crossed 60 natural isolates sampled from diverse niches with the reference strain S288c and identified 16 cases of reproductive isolation with reduced offspring viabilities, and identified reciprocal chromosomal translocations in a large fraction of isolates.&lt;ref name="Hou2014" /&gt;

=== Incompatibility caused by microorganisms ===
In addition to the genetic causes of reproductive isolation between species there is another factor that can cause post zygotic isolation: the presence of [[microorganism]]s in the cytoplasm of certain species. The presence of these organisms in a species and their absence in another causes the non-viability of the corresponding hybrid. For example, in the [[semi-species]] of the group ''D. paulistorum'' the hybrid females are fertile but the males are sterile, this is due to the presence of a ''[[Wolbachia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001214| pmid=21151959| pmc=2996333|title = Infectious Speciation Revisited: Impact of Symbiont-Depletion on Female Fitness and Mating Behavior of Drosophila paulistorum| journal=PLOS Pathogens| volume=6| issue=12| pages=e1001214|year = 2010|last1 = Miller|first1 = Wolfgang J.| last2=Ehrman| first2=Lee| last3=Schneider| first3=Daniela}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cytoplasm which alters [[spermatogenesis]] leading to sterility. It is interesting that incompatibility or isolation can also arise at an intraspecific level. Populations of ''D. simulans'' have been studied that show hybrid sterility according to the direction of the cross. The factor determining sterility has been found to be the presence or absence of a microorganism ''[[Wolbachia]]'' and the populations tolerance or susceptibility to these organisms. This inter population incompatibility can be eliminated in the laboratory through the administration of a specific [[antibiotic]] to kill the microorganism. Similar situations are known in a number of insects, as around 15% of species show infections caused by this [[symbiosis|symbiont]]. It has been suggested that, in some cases, the speciation process has taken place because of the incompatibility caused by this bacteria. Two [[wasp]] species ''[[Nasonia giraulti]]'' and ''N. longicornis'' carry two different strains of ''Wolbachia''. Crosses between an infected population and one free from infection produces a nearly total reproductive isolation between the semi-species. However, if both species are free from the bacteria or both are treated with antibiotics there is no reproductive barrier.&lt;ref name=Breeuwer1990&gt;{{citation | last1=Breeuwer | first1=J.A.J. | last2=Werren | first2=J.H. | year=1990 | title=Microorganisms associated with chromosome destruction and reproductive isolation between two insect species | journal=Nature | pmid=2377229 | volume=346 | issue=6284 | pages=558–560 | doi=10.1038/346558a0 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v346/n6284/abs/346558a0.html

In 1950 [[K. F. Koopman]] reported results from experiments designed to examine the hypothesis that [[artificial selection|selection]] can increase reproductive isolation between populations. He used ''D. pseudoobscura'' and ''D. persimilis'' in these experiments. When the flies of these species are kept at 16&amp;nbsp;°C approximately a third of the matings are interspecific. In the experiment equal numbers of males and females of both species were placed in containers suitable for their survival and reproduction. The progeny of each generation were examined in order to determine if there were any interspecific hybrids. These hybrids were then eliminated. An equal number of males and females of the resulting progeny were then chosen to act as progenitors of the next generation. As the hybrids were destroyed in each generation the flies that solely mated with members of their own species produced more surviving descendants than the flies that mated solely with individuals of the other species. In the adjacent table it can be seen that for each generation the number of hybrids continuously decreased up to the tenth generation when hardly any interspecific hybrids were produced.&lt;ref name=Koop&gt;{{Citation | doi=10.2307/2405390 | author=Koopman K.F. | year=1950 | title=Natural selection for reproductive isolation between ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' and ''Drosophila persimilis''| journal=Evolution | volume=4 | issue=2| pages=135–148 | postscript=. | jstor=2405390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is evident that selection against the hybrids was very effective in increasing reproductive isolation between these species. From the third generation, the proportions of the hybrids were less than 5%. This confirmed that selection acts to reinforce the reproductive isolation of two genetically divergent populations if the hybrids formed by these species are less well adapted than their parents.

These discoveries allowed certain assumptions to be made regarding the origin of reproductive isolation mechanisms in nature. Namely, if selection reinforces the degree of reproductive isolation that exists between two species due to the poor adaptive value of the hybrids, it is expected that the populations of two species located in the same area will show a greater reproductive isolation than populations that are geographically separated (see [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]]). This mechanism for "reinforcing" hybridization barriers in sympatric populations is also known as the "[[Wallace effect]]", as it was first proposed by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] at the end of the 19th century, and it has been experimentally demonstrated in both plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ollerton|first=J|title=Flowering time and the Wallace Effect|url=http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf|work=Heredity, August 2005|accessdate=2007-05-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605063504/http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sawyer1981&gt;{{citation | last1=Sawyer | first1=S. | last2=Hartl | first2=D. | year=1981 | title=On the evolution of behavioral reproductive isolation: the Wallace effect | journal=Theor.

The sexual isolation between ''[[Drosophila miranda]]'' and ''D. pseudoobscura'', for example, is more or less pronounced according to the geographic origin of the flies being studied. Flies from regions where the distribution of the species is superimposed show a greater sexual isolation than exists between populations originating in distant regions.

[[File:Drosophila speciation.svg|thumb|right|550px|Reproductive isolation can be caused by allopatric speciation. A population of ''Drosophila'' was divided into sub populations selected to adapt to different food types. After some generations the two sub populations were mixed again. Subsequent matings occurred between individuals belonging to the same adapted group.&lt;ref name=Dodd/&gt;]]

On the other hand, interspecific hybridization barriers can also arise as a result of the adaptive divergence that accompanies [[allopatric speciation]]. This mechanism has been experimentally proved by an experiment carried out by [[Diane Dodd]] on ''D. pseudoobscura''. A single population of flies was divided into two, with one of the populations fed with [[starch]]-based food and the other with [[maltose]]-based food.  This meant that each sub population was adapted to each food type over a number of generations. After the populations had diverged over many generations, the groups were again mixed; it was observed that the flies would mate only with others from their adapted population. This indicates that the mechanisms of reproductive isolation can arise even though the interspecific hybrids are not selected against.&lt;ref name=Dodd&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodd | first1 = D.M.B. | year = 1989 | title = Reproductive isolation as a consequence of adaptive divergence in ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' | url = http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Evolution | volume = 43 | issue =  | pages = 1308–1311 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100331155909/http://eebweb.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf | archivedate = 31 March 2010 | df = dmy-all | doi=10.2307/2409365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} The DNA of the mitochondria and chloroplasts is inherited from the maternal line, i.e. all the progeny derived from a particular cross possess the same cytoplasm (and genetic factors located in it) as the female progenitor. This is because the zygote possesses the same cytoplasm as the ovule, although its nucleus comes equally from the father and the mother.&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;

{{short description|theme in fiction and legends}}
{{broader|Rotating locomotion in living systems}}
[[Legend]]s and [[speculative fiction]] reveal a longstanding human fascination with [[Rotating locomotion in living systems|rolling and wheeled creatures]]. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia,{{r|Full93}} and in numerous modern works.

==Rolling creatures==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}}

[[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s 1825 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having "the shape of a star or wheel".{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} The 1863 edition of this book featured an illustration by [[Louis Le Breton]], depicting a creature with five legs radially arranged.{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

[[Neil R. Jones]]' 1937 story "On the Planet Fragment" featured aliens dubbed the Disci, which were shaped like wheels with limbs around the circumference. One of their methods of locomotion was a "rolling motion like that of a cartwheel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?87356|title=Internet Speculative Fiction Database entry for "On the Planet Fragment"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1944 science fiction short story "[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]", by [[Fredric Brown]], features a telepathic alien called an Outsider, which is roughly spherical and moves by rolling.{{r|Brown}} The story was the basis for a 1967 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode of the [[Arena (Star Trek)|same name]], and possibly also a 1964 episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled [[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|"Fun and Games"]], though neither television treatment included a spherical creature.{{r|arena}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] invented a creature that was capable of rolling itself forward, which he named ''Pedalternorotandomovens centroculatus articulosus''. He illustrated this creature in his 1951 lithograph {{lang|nl|[[Curl-up|Wentelteefje]]}} (also known by the English title ''Curl-up'').{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Escher}}

A 1956 [[Scrooge McDuck]] comic, ''[[Land Beneath the Ground!]]'', by [[Carl Barks]], introduced Terries and Fermies (a play on the phrase ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]''), creatures who move from place to place by rolling. The Terries and Fermies have made a sport of their rolling abilities, causing earthquakes in the process.{{r|coa1}}{{r|coa2}}

Northern Irish author [[James White (author)|James White]]'s [[Sector General]] series features "Rollers" from the planet Drambo, doughnut-shaped aquatic organisms that do not have [[heart]]s, but which instead must roll continuously to maintain [[Circulatory system|circulation]] by means of gravity.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|Louie}} The Rollers are described in the short story "Spacebird" in the 1980 edition of ''[[Ambulance Ship]]'', and in other works in the series.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|"Final_Diagnosis"}}{{r|"Double_Contact"}}

In ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]'' (1983) by [[Steve Jackson (British game designer)|Steve Jackson]], the reader may encounter Wheelies, disc-shaped creatures with four arms who move by doing [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]].&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=Neil|title=Fighting Fantasy Reviewed - The Citadel of Chaos|url=https://rpggeek.com/thread/488700/fighting-fantasy-reviewed-citadel-chaos|website=RPGGeek|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Steve|title=The Citadel of Chaos|date=1983|isbn=978-1-84831-076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', a 1986 science fiction novel by [[George R. R. Martin]], features an alien called a Rolleram, described as a "berserk living cannonball of enormous size", which kills its prey by rolling over it and crushing it, before digesting it externally. Adults of the species weigh approximately six metric tons and can roll faster than {{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr=off}}.{{r|martin}}

In the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991, the eponymous [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and his sidekick [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] move by rolling.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

The 1995 short story "Microbe", by [[Kenyon College]] biologist and [[feminist science fiction]] writer [[Joan Slonczewski]], describes an exploratory expedition to an alien world whose plant and animal life consists entirely of [[torus|doughnut-shaped]] organisms.{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}}

==Wheeled creatures==
Toy animals with wheels dating from the [[Pre-Columbian era]] were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

[[File:Wheeler Ozma of Oz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=L. Frank Baum's "Wheeler"|A "Wheeler" in L. Frank Baum's ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (Illustration by [[John R. Neill]])]]
{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
[[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}}  Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}} They also make an appearance in the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', based partly on  ''Ozma of Oz''.

The 1968 novel ''[[The Goblin Reservation]]'' by [[Clifford D. Simak]] features an intelligent alien race that uses biological wheels.{{r|Simak}}

''[[Chorlton and the Wheelies]]'', a British [[stop motion|stop-motion]]-animated television series that aired from 1976 to 1979, was set in "Wheelie World", which was inhabited by three-wheeled creatures called "wheelies".{{r|Toonhound}}

[[Piers Anthony]]'s 1977 book ''[[Cluster (novels)|Cluster]]'' and its sequels feature aliens called Polarians, which locomote by gripping and balancing atop a large ball. The ball is a living, though temporarily separable, portion of the Polarian's body.{{r|anthony}}

[[David Brin]]'s [[Uplift Universe|''Uplift'' Universe]] includes a wheeled species called the g'Kek, which are described in some detail in the 1995 novel ''[[Brightness Reef]]''.{{r|Brin95}} In 1996's ''[[Infinity's Shore]]'', a g'Kek is described as looking like "a squid in a wheelchair." The g'Kek suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles in their old age, particularly when living in a [[gravitational biology|high gravity environment]].{{r|Brin95}}{{r|Brin96}}

A 1997 novel in the ''[[Animorphs]]'' series, ''[[The Andalite Chronicles]]'', includes an alien called a Mortron, composed of two separate entities: a yellow and black bottom half with four wheels, and a red, elongated head with razor-sharp teeth and concealed wings.{{r|Applegate}}

The 2000 novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', by English author [[Philip Pullman]], features an alien race known as the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]], which have diamond-shaped bodies with one leg at the front and back and one on each side. The Mulefa use large, disk-shaped seed pods as wheels. They mount the pods on bone axles on their front and back legs, while propelling themselves with their side legs. The Mulefa have a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with the seed pod trees, which depend on the rolling action to crack open the pods and allow the seeds to [[Seed dispersal|disperse]].{{r|Pullman}}

In the 2000 novel [[Wheelers (novel)|''Wheelers'']], by English mathematician [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and reproductive biologist [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]] species called "blimps" has developed the ability to biologically produce machines called "wheelers", which use wheels for locomotion.{{r|Stewart}}{{r|kirkus}}

The children's television series ''[[Jungle Junction]]'', which premiered in 2009, features hybrid jungle animals with wheels rather than legs;{{r|BBC-Jungle}} one such animal, Ellyvan, is a hybrid of an [[elephant]] and a [[van]].{{r|junglejunction}} These animals traverse their habitat on elevated [[highway]]s.{{r|disney}}

[[File:Wheeled animal - East Mexico cultures - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC00852.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A toy animal with wheels, from [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Mexico]]{{r|Gambino}}|alt=A toy animal with wheels]]
[[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|Several organisms]] are capable of [[rolling]] locomotion; however, true [[wheel]]s and [[propeller]]s—despite their utility in human [[vehicle]]s—do not appear to play a significant role in the [[animal locomotion|movement of living things]] (with the exception of certain [[flagellum|flagella]], which function like [[corkscrew]]s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in [[speculative fiction]].

Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as [[wing]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]]), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several [[developmental biology|developmental]] and [[evolution]]ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by [[natural selection]], addressing the question "Why can't life evolve wheels?" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[Terrestrial_locomotion#Limbless_locomotion|slithering]]) in natural environments, addressing the question "If wheels ''could'' evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.&lt;!--Cited in section [[#Rolling resistance]]; per [[WP:LEADCITE]], statements in the lead don't require citation here if cited elsewhere in the article--&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Known instances of rotation in biology==
There exist two distinct modes of [[wikt:locomotion|locomotion]] using [[rotation]]: first, simple [[rolling]]; and second, the use of [[wheel]]s or [[propeller]]s, which spin on an [[axle]] or [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]], relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] organisms.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}}

===Rolling===
[[File:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A curled-up pangolin|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in a defensive posture, in which it can roll]]
{{see also|Category:Rolling animals}}
Some organisms use [[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|rolling]] as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.{{r|Krus}}{{r|merriam-webster}}

Several species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including [[Patania ruralis|certain caterpillars]] (which do so to [[Anti-predator adaptation|escape danger]]),{{r|Krus}}{{r|Scholtz}} [[Cicindela dorsalis|tiger beetle]] larvae, [[myriapoda|myriapods]], [[mantis shrimp]], [[Armadillidiidae]], and [[Mount Lyell salamander]]s.{{r|Full93}} Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in [[pangolin]]s, [[wheel spider]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[Armadillo girdled lizard]]s, [[isopoda|isopods]], and [[fossil]]ized [[trilobite]]s.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.{{r|Scholtz}}

[[Tumbleweed]]s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to [[Seed dispersal|distribute their seeds]]. These plants are found especially in open [[plain]] environments.{{r|Ganong}} The most well-known of these include ''[[Kali tragus]]'' (also known as ''Salsola tragus''), or prickly Russian thistle,&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=SATR12|taxon=Salsola tragus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a [[noxious weed]].&lt;ref name="Main"/&gt; Fungi of the genus ''[[Bovista]]'' are known to use the same strategy to disperse their [[spore]]s.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

[[Rotifers]] are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name="Howey"/&gt; Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''rotifer'' means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating [[cilia]] used for feeding and propulsion.{{r|pechenik}}

[[Keratinocyte]]s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of [[wound healing]].{{r|Myers}}{{r|Anderson}} These cells serve to form a barrier against [[pathogen]]s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.&lt;ref name="ABN"/&gt;

[[Dung beetle]]s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.{{r|Scholtz}}

}}
Among animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for [[digestion]] rather than propulsion: the [[style (zoology)|crystalline style]] of certain [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and [[gastropoda|gastropods]].{{r|owen}}{{rp|89}} The style consists of a transparent [[glycoprotein]] rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of [[mucus]]. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases [[digestive enzyme]]s.{{r|owen}} Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style ''in vivo'' vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.{{r|kristensen}}

====Molecular====
There are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells.{{r|Oster}} [[ATP synthase]] is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer.{{r|Feniouk}} It bears some similarity to the [[flagellum|flagellar motors]] discussed below.{{r|Crofts}} ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by [[mosaic evolution|modular evolution]], in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.{{r|Falk}}

[[File:Physical model of a bacterial flagellum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Model of the base of a bacterial flagellum, a true biological example of a freely rotating structure|alt=Physical model of the base of a bacterial flagellum]]
The only known example of a biological "wheel"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive [[torque]] about a fixed body—is the  [[flagellum]], a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled [[prokaryote]]s for propulsion.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}} The [[bacterial flagellum]] is the best known example.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|gebremichael}} About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.{{r|goldsworthy}}

At the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a [[motor protein]] acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by [[proton motive force]], i.e. by the flow of [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a [[concentration gradient]] set up by the cell's [[metabolism]]. (In species of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]'', there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a [[sodium]] [[ion transporter|ion pump]] rather than a [[proton pump]].{{r|Atsumi}}) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;cell lengths per second.{{r|Franklin}} The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.{{r|Oster}} ''[[Spiral_bacteria#Spirillum|Spirillum]]'' bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.{{r|Chwang}}

[[Archaea]], a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as [[archaellum |archaella]] – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and [[homology (biology)|evolutionarily distinct]] from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], archaella appear to have evolved from [[Pilus#Type IV pili |type IV pili]].{{r|ng}}

Some [[eukaryotic]] cells, such as the protist ''[[Euglena]]'', also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle.{{r|Moran}}{{rp|1105}} The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a [[cilium]] or [[undulipodium]], is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.{{r|mitchell}}

==Biological barriers to wheeled organisms==

The absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: [[natural selection]] constrains the [[evolution]]ary paths available to species,{{r|Dawkins}} and the processes by which [[multicellular organism]]s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.{{r|gould81}}

===Evolutionary constraints===
[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Sketch of a fitness landscape|Illustration of a [[fitness landscape]], indicating genetic flow of populations toward local [[wikt:optimum|optima]]. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness "valley" are foreclosed by natural selection.]]

The processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.{{r|Dawkins}}

According to [[neo-Darwinism]], adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals.{{r|Dawkins}} Although [[Neutral mutation|neutral changes]] (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through [[genetic drift]],{{r|kimura}} and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances,{{r|otto}}{{rp|728–729}} large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the matter: "The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of [[Mount Improbable]]."{{r|Dawkins}} In such a [[fitness landscape]], wheels might sit on a highly favorable "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the [[gene pool]] to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}}

Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the [[evolution of flagella]], individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells.{{r|matzke03}}{{r|matzke06}}{{r|pallen}} This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called ''[[exaptation]]''.{{r|gould82}}

Molecular biologist [[Robin Holliday]] has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against [[creationism|creationist]] or [[intelligent design]] accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.{{r|Holliday}}
{{clear}}

===Developmental and anatomical constraints===
{{Wikibooks|Biomechanics}}
Using human [[manufacturing]] processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of [[developmental biology|embryonic development]] are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.{{refn|group=Note|Although evolutionary and developmental constraints may preclude the possibility of a wheel as ''part'' of an organism, they do not preclude the use of foreign objects as "wheels", either instinctively (as in the case of the dung beetles discussed above), or through intelligently directed [[tool use by animals|tool use]] (as in human technology).}}{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|gould81}}{{r|Fish}}

The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the [[biointerface|interface]] between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly [[axle]]) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism.{{refn|group=Note|Wheels can be considered to fall into two types: passive and driven. A passive wheel simply rolls freely over a surface, reducing [[friction]] when compared with dragging. A driven wheel is powered, and transmits energy to the surface in order to generate forward motion.{{r|Bräunl}}}} Unlike animal [[joint]]s, which have a limited [[range of motion]], a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be "unwound". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism).{{r|gould81}}{{rp|44}} There are several functional problems created by this requirement.

====Power transmission to driven wheels====
[[File:Biceps (PSF).jpg|alt=Drawing of human arm muscles|Skeletal muscle, attached at each end to bone|thumb]]
In the case of a driven wheel, a [[torque]] must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including [[Electric motor|electric]], [[Internal combustion engine|piston-driven]], [[Turbine|turbine-driven]], [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]], and [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic]]. (Torque may also be provided by [[human power]], as in the case of a [[bicycle]].) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|406}} Because these muscles are [[connective tissue|attached]] to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.{{r|Fish}}

====Friction====
Reducing friction is vital for minimizing [[wear]] on mechanical components and preventing overheating.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|1}} As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|2–3}} Various types of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and/or [[lubricant]] may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components.{{r|Jones}} In biological joints such as the human [[knee]], friction is reduced by means of [[cartilage]] with a very low [[Coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]], as well as lubricating [[synovial fluid]], which has very low [[viscosity]].{{r|Callaghan}} Gerhard Scholtz of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] asserts that a similar [[secretion|secreted]] lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.{{r|Scholtz}}

====Nutrient and waste transfer====
Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with [[oxygen]] and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal [[circulatory system]], composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface.{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|405}} In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available [[partial pressure]] and [[surface area]], in accordance with [[Fick's law of diffusion]].{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}} For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient.{{r|Diamond}} Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as [[keratin]], of which [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are composed.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}}

==Disadvantages of wheels==
Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbed]] locomotion.{{r|Dawkins}} These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the "missed opportunity" of biology that it first seems.{{r|Scholtz}} In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?"{{r|Diamond}} The use of wheels rather than limbs in most [[engineering|engineered]] vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of [[design]] required to construct and [[control system|control]] limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.{{r|Full02}}{{r|Donat}}

===Efficiency===

====Rolling resistance====
[[File:Rolling Resistance.PNG|right|thumb|alt=Diagram of the forces acting on a wheel|A hard wheel rolling on—and deforming—a soft surface, resulting in the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] ''N'', which has a component that opposes the motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(''W'' is the weight of the wheel plus the portion of the vehicle being supported; ''F'' is a propulsive force; ''N'' is the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] from the surface; ''r'' is the radius of wheel.)]]

Although stiff wheels are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level [[terrain]] (such as [[Road surface|paved roads]]), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as [[soil]], because they are vulnerable to [[rolling resistance]]. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|401}} Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater.{{r|Diamond}} While wheels must deform the surface along their [[rut (roads)|entire path]], limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.{{r|Todd}}

Rolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels.{{r|Diamond}} During the time of the [[Roman Empire]], wheeled [[chariot]]s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to [[dromedary|camel]]s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by [[ox]]en.{{r|lienhard}}

====Efficiency of aquatic locomotion====
When moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low [[Reynolds number]]s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems have the advantage at higher ([[inertia]]-dominated) Reynolds numbers.{{r|Radharkrishnan}}{{rp|5451}} Whereas ship propellers typically have [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]] around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered ''[[Gossamer Condor]]''), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] like a fish tail or bird wing.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|398}}{{r|Diamond}}

Wheels are prone to [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slipping]]—an inability to generate [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of [[biologically inspired engineering]], [[Walker (machine)#Real walking vehicles|legged vehicles]] find use in the [[logging]] industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate.{{r|space.com}} [[Continuous track|Tracked]] vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground{{r|Wong}}{{rp|354}}—but they tend to have larger [[turning radius|turning radii]] than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.{{r|Wong}}{{rp|419}}

===Obstacle navigation===
[[File:Mountain Goat on Mount Huron in Colorado Image 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Mountain goats on rocky terrain|A [[mountain goat]] navigating a rocky landscape. Mountain goats illustrate the versatility of legs in challenging terrain.]]
Work by engineer [[Mieczysław G. Bekker]] implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains [[scale invariance|at all size scales]].{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400–401}} The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.{{r|Diamond}}

====Going around====
Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the [[University of Chicago]] illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and [[wheelchair]]-using humans.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402}} As [[Jared Diamond]] points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by [[dung beetle]]s and [[tumbleweed]]s.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Nof}}{{r|Bala}}

====Going over====
Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height.{{r|Nof}}{{rp|148}} Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400}}

In addition, without [[wikt:articulation|articulation]], a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground.{{r|Bala}} Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402–403}}

With unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the [[wheelbase]] or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over.{{r|nap}} At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning.{{r|johnson}} Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.

===Versatility===
Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as [[prehensility|grasping]], [[fine motor skill|manipulating]], [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[brachiation|branch-swinging]], [[aquatic locomotion#Secondary evolution of swimming|swimming]], [[fossorial|digging]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], [[kick]]ing, and [[personal grooming|grooming]]. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|399}}

==In fiction and legend==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
{{main|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}
Legends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia.{{r|Full93}}

===Rolling creatures===
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}} [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described and illustrated in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.{{r|de_Plancy_1825}}{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in [[Curl-up|a 1951 lithograph]].{{r|Escher}} Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author [[Carl Barks]],{{r|Andrae}} science fiction writers [[Fredric Brown]],{{r|Brown}} [[George R. R. Martin]],{{r|martin}} and [[Joan Slonczewski]],{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}} and in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

===Wheeled creatures===
Toy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
Several twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}} Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}}

In the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including [[Clifford D. Simak]],{{r|Simak}} [[Piers Anthony]],{{r|anthony}} [[David Brin]],{{r|Brin95}} [[K. A. Applegate]],{{r|Applegate}} [[Philip Pullman]],{{r|Pullman}} and writing partners [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]].{{r|Stewart}} Some of these works address the developmental and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles,{{r|Brin95}}{{rp|109}} and Pullman's [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they [[coevolution|coevolved]].{{r|Pullman}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">In philosophy and psychology, '''self-fulfillment''' is the realizing of one's deepest desires and capacities. The history of this concept can be traced to [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers and it still remains a notable concept in modern philosophy.

==Definition and history==
Philosopher [[Alan Gewirth]] in his book ''Self-Fulfillment'' defined self-fulfillment as "carrying to fruition one's deepest desires or one's worthiest capacities."&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Another definition states that self-fulfillment is "the attainment of a satisfying and worthwhile life well lived."&lt;ref name="Kerr2009"/&gt; It is an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that can be traced to [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers, and one that has been common and popular in both Western and non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Self-fulfillment is often seen as superior to other values and goals.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;

Gewirth notes that "to seek for a good human life is to seek for self-fulfillment".&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; However, in modern philosophy, the ideal of self-fulfillment has become less popular, criticized by thinkers such as [[Hobbes]] and [[Freud]], who feel there are conceptual and moral problems associated with it.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; It has been called an [[Egotism|egoistic]] concept, impossible to achieve, with some suggesting that it is an obsolete concept that should be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;  Moral philosophers focus less on obtaining a good life, and more on interpersonal relations and duties owed to others.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;  Similarly, whereas [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw the goal of the [[polis]] in providing a means of self-fulfillment to citizens, modern governments have given up on that, focusing rather on maintaining [[civic order]].&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Despite the criticism, the concept of self-fulfillment still persists in modern philosophy, its usefulness defended by thinkers such as Gewirth himself.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;

Gewirth noted that the term self-fulfillment has two near [[synonyms]]: [[self-realization]] and [[self-actualization]], used respectively by philosophers and humanist psychologists, whereas the term self-fulfillment is more commonly used outside those expert fields.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-6-8"/&gt; Gewirth however argues that this concept is sufficiently different from those others to merit not being used as a synonym.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-6-8"/&gt; Self-actualization in particular, often discussed in the context of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], is frequently defined as the "need for self-fulfillment".&lt;ref name="ReeceBrandt2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PastorinoDoyle-Portillo2012"/&gt;

Dr. Ben Carvosso in his book ''Life CEO - Take Charge, and start doing your life's work, not your busy work'' discussed the prevalence of individuals who's lives are busy, full but unfulfilled. Individuals who's lives are unfulfilled because something is missing and who come to the mistaken conclusion (driven by cleaver marketing by big corporations) that the solution is work harder and make more money to somehow make more time. Self-fulfillment comes from knowing what you really want, not what society says you should want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1041112060|title=Life CEO : take charge and start doing your life's work not your busy work|last=Ben,|first=Carvosso,|isbn=9780648216704|location=[place of publication not identified]|oclc=1041112060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its only when we connect with what we really want that we experience true joy or [[Eudaimonia]].

Self-fulfillment has been positively connected to [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="Kerr2009"/&gt;

'''Shangri-La''' is a fictional place described in the 1933 [[novel]] ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by British author [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]. Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a [[lamasery]], enclosed in the western end of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, particularly a mythical Himalayan [[utopia]] – a permanently happy land, isolated from the world. In the novel, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living hundreds of years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance. The name also evokes the imagery of the [[exoticism]] of [[the Orient]].

In the ancient Tibetan scriptures, the existence of seven such places is mentioned as ''Nghe-Beyul Khembalung''.&lt;ref name="National Park brochure"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shrestha |first=Dr. Tirtha Bahadur |author2=Joshi, Rabindra Man |author3=Sangam, Khagendra
|title=The Makalu-Barun National Park &amp; Buffer Zone Brochure |publisher=Makalu-Barun National Park |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khembalung is one of several ''[[beyul]]s'' (hidden lands similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 9th&amp;nbsp;century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard, 1978).

==Etymology==
The phrase "Shangri-La" most probably comes from the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''{{lang|bo|ཞང་}}'',"Shang" – a district of [[Ü-Tsang]], north of [[Tashilhunpo]]&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Das – Tibetan English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;" + ''{{lang|bo|རི}}'', pronounced "ri", "Mountain" = "Shang Mountain" + ''{{lang|bo|ལ}}'', Mountain Pass, which suggests that the area is accessed to, or is named by, "Shang Mountain Pass".

While the name Shangri-La is of relatively recent origin, the concept previously existed.
* Some scholars believe that the Shangri-La story owes a literary debt to [[Shambhala]], a mythical kingdom in Tibetan [[Buddhist]] tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"&gt;{{cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url= |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jewish sources describe a city named [[Luz]], "in which the angel of death has no permission to enter for a thousand years: its citizens have the ability to live forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/between-luz-and-beit-el-power-transformational-moments
|title=Between Luz And Beit El: The Power of Transformational Moments}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same description is given for a location named ''Kushta'' - based on the [[Aramaic]] word for truth. In this city, the only reason for death was if a person told an untruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Academic scholars have debunked the myth of Shangri-La and argued that this has less to do with an unexplored place and is more connected to a fantasy of the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Peter (1989).

Berkeley: University of California Press. https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Shangri-Writing-Creation-Landscape/dp/0520066863&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald (1998). ''Prisoners of Shangri-La''.

===Ancient sources with similar descriptions===
[[File:Zhongdian-sumtseling-gompa-c12.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Zhongdian]] in [[Yunnan]]]]
In China, the poet [[Tao Yuanming]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420&amp;nbsp;CE) described a kind of Shangri-La in his work ''[[The Peach Blossom Spring|The Tale of the Peach Blossom Spring]]'' ({{zh|t=桃花源記|p=Táohuā Yuán Jì}}). The story goes that there was a fisherman from [[Wuling]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2018}}, who came across a beautiful peach grove, and he discovered happy and content people who lived completely cut off from the troubles in the outside world since the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–207&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="Peach Colony"&gt;{{cite web

[[Shambhala]] is a core concept in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] that describes a realm of harmony between man and nature that is also connected with the Kalachakra or "wheel of time". The Shambhala ideal is described in detail in the [[Shambhala Sutra]], a historical text written by the [[Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama|Sixth Panchen Lama (1737–1780)]] which describes some of the Shambhala locations as being in [[Ngari]], the western prefecture of [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition&gt;[[Laurence Brahm|Brahm, Laurence]]. (2004). ''Shambhala Sutrah'' (film expedition).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_1972"&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972). ''Tibetan Civilization'', pp.&amp;nbsp;88–89. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore from the [[Altai Mountains]] describe [[Gora Belukha|Mount Belukha]] as a gateway to [[Shambhala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-asia/mysteries-kingdom-shambhala-001529|title=Mysteries of the Kingdom of Shambhala|first=|last=aprilholloway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kun Lun Mountains]] (崑崙山) offer another possible place for valleys like the Shangri-La, since Hilton specifically described the “Kuen-Lun” mountains as its likely location in the book, however, Hilton is not known to have visited or studied the area.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Parts of the [[Kun Lun Mountains|Kun Lun]] lie within [[Ngari]], mentioned in the [[Shambhala]] Sutra.&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_1972"/&gt;

===Possible sources for Hilton===
In a ''New York Times'' interview in 1936, Hilton states that he used "Tibetan material" from the [[British Museum]], particularly the travelogue of two French priests, [[Evariste Regis Huc]] and [[Joseph Gabet]], to provide the Tibetan cultural and Buddhist spiritual inspiration for Shangri-La.&lt;ref name="McRae"&gt;Michael McRae. (2002). ''The Siege of Shangri-La: The Quest for Tibet's Sacred Hidden Paradise''. New York: Broadway Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;B.R. Crisler. (1936). Film gossip of the week. ''The New York Times'', 26&amp;nbsp;July 1936, section&amp;nbsp;9, page&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Huc and Gabet travelled a roundtrip between Beijing and Lhasa in 1844–1846 on a route more than {{convert|250|km}} north of Yunnan. Their famous travelogue, first published in French in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;Evariste Regis Huc. (1850). ''Souvenirs d'un&amp;nbsp;voyage dans la&amp;nbsp;Tartarie, le&amp;nbsp;Thibet et la&amp;nbsp;Chine pendant les&amp;nbsp;annees 1844, 1845, et 1846''. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; went through many editions in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Mille. (1953). A selective survey of literature on Tibet. ''American Political Science Review'', 47&amp;nbsp;(4): 1135–1151.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular "condensed translation" was published in England in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;Evariste Regis Huc &amp; Joseph Gabet. (1928). ''Travels in Tartary, Thibet and China, 1844–1846''. Edited and translated by William Hazlitt. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time that Hilton would have been gathering inspiration for – or perhaps writing – ''Lost Horizon''.

===Current claimants===
Today various places, such as parts of southern [[Kham]] in northwestern [[Yunnan]] province, including the tourist destinations of [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and Zhongdian, claim the title. In modern China, [[Zhongdian]] county was renamed Xiānggélǐlā (香格里拉, Shangri-La in Chinese) in 2001, to attract tourists.

Hilton visited the [[Hunza Valley]] in northern [[Pakistan]], close to the Chinese border, a few years before ''Lost Horizon'' was published; hence it is a popularly believed inspiration for Hilton's physical description of Shangri-La.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Shangri-la Valley |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=2006-07-29 |publisher=Adventure Tours Pakistan |url=http://www.atp.com.pk/tours/Shangri-La%20Valley.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615083212/http://atp.com.pk/tours/Shangri-La%20Valley.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being an isolated green valley surrounded by mountains, enclosed on the western end of the Himalayas, it closely matches the description in the novel; also, in an ironic reversal on the story, due to increased exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation, inhabitants of the high-altitude parts of the valley appear to age quickly.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, because the Hunza Valley does not have [[Tibetan culture]] and lacks Buddhist religion, it could not have been the inspiration for the cultural context for Hilton's [[Lost Horizon|story]].

Places like [[Sichuan]] and [[Tibet]] also claim the real Shangri-La was in its{{where|date=January 2014}} territory. In 2001, [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] put forward a proposal that the three regions optimise all Shangri-La tourism resources and promote them as one. After failed attempts to establish a China Shangri-la Ecological Tourism Zone in 2002 and 2003, government representatives of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and Tibet Autonomous Region signed a declaration of co-operation in 2004. Also in 2001, [[Zhongdian]] County in northwestern [[Yunnan]] officially renamed itself [[Shangri-La County]].

===Recent searches and documentaries===
American explorers [[Ted Vaill]] and [[Peter Klika]] visited the [[Muli Tibetan Autonomous County|Muli]] area of southern [[Sichuan Province]] in 1999, and claimed that the Muli [[monastery]] in this remote region was the model for James Hilton's Shangri-La, which they thought Hilton learned about from articles on this area in several ''National Geographic'' magazine articles in the late 1920s and early 1930s written by Austrian-American explorer [[Joseph Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/tibet/1402958/Could-this-be-the-way-to-Shangri-La.html "Could This Be the Way to Shangri-La?"] by Timothy Carroll (29&amp;nbsp;July 2002). ''Electronic Telegraph''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaill completed a film based on their research, "Finding Shangri-La", which debuted at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. However, Michael McRae unearthed an obscure James Hilton interview from a ''[[New York Times]]'' gossip column where he reveals his cultural inspiration for Shangri-La and, if it is any place, it is more than 250&amp;nbsp;km north of Muli on the route travelled by Huc and Gabet.&lt;ref name="McRae"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Between 2002–2004 a series of expeditions were led by author and film maker Laurence Brahm in western China which determined that the Shangri-La mythical location in Hilton's book ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' was based on references to northern [[Yunnan]] Province from articles published by National Geographic's first resident explorer [[Joseph Rock]].&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/&gt;

On 2&amp;nbsp;December 2010, [[OPB]] televised one of [[Martin Yan]]'s ''[[Hidden China]]'' episodes, "Life in Shangri-La", in which Yan said that "Shangri-La" is the actual name of a [[Shangri-La County|real town]] in the hilly and mountainous region in northwestern [[Yunnan]] Province, frequented by both [[Han Chinese|Han]] and Tibetan locals. Martin Yan visited arts and craft shops, local farmers as they harvest crops, and sampled their cuisine.

Television presenter and historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], in the "Shangri-La" episode of the BBC documentary series ''In Search of Myths and Heroes'', suggests that the legendary Shangri-La is the abandoned city of [[Tsaparang]] in upper [[Satluj]] valley, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of [[Guge]] in modern Tibet.
The Travel Channel recently aired an episode of Expedition Unknown that followed host Josh Gates to Nepal and its surrounding areas in search of Shangri-La. His findings are not necessarily proof that Shangri-La is or was real. However, the sky caves that are found do represent some interesting facts.

[[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" contains the following lyrics: "Like Shangri-La beneath the summer moon / I will return again / As the dust that floats finds you / We're movin' through Kashmir."

"Shangri-La" is a song written by Ray Davies of The Kinks. The song appeared on the 1969 concept album, ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]''. The song's inspiration can be traced back to when the band visited the Davies brothers' sister, Rose, and her family in Australia, the "designed community" that the family lived in serving as the initial lyrical inspiration.

Shangri-La also appears in the Oasis song "Idler's Dream", B-side to ''[[The Hindu Times]]''. The lyrics appear as: 
"And as I close my eyes,
And the sky turns red
I realise just what you are.
You're an idler's dream,
and you're singing Shangri-la
Shangri-la
Shangri-la

English rock band [[Arctic Monkeys]] mentioned Shangri-La in the song "[[Suck It and See]]", from their fourth studio album, released on 6 June 2011 by Domino Recording Company. The lyrics appear as: 
"Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh"

==Usage==
Shangri-La is often used in a similar context to "[[Garden of Eden]]," to represent a paradise hidden from modern man. It is sometimes used as an analogy for a lifelong quest or something elusive that is much sought. For a man who spends his life obsessively looking for a cure to a disease, such a cure could be said to be that man's "Shangri-La." It also might be used to represent perfection that is sought by man in the form of love, happiness, or [[Utopia]]n ideals. It may be used in this context alongside other mythical and famous examples of somewhat similar metaphors such as [[El Dorado]], [[The Fountain of Youth]], and [[The Holy Grail]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17263">'''Sperm sorting''' is a means of choosing what type of [[sperm cell]] is to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] the [[egg cell]]. Several conventional techniques of  [[density gradient centrifugation|centrifugation]] or [[swim-up]]. Newly applied methods such as flow cytometry expand the possibilities of sperm sorting and new techniques of sperm sorting are being developed.

It can be used to sort out sperm that are most healthy, as well as for determination of more specific traits, such as [[sex selection]] in which spermatozoa are separated into [[X chromosome|X-]] (female) and [[Y chromosome|Y-]] (male) chromosome bearing populations based on their difference in DNA content. The resultant 'sex-sorted' spermatozoa are then able to be used in conjunction with other assisted reproductive technologies such as [[artificial insemination]] or [[in-vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to produce offspring of the desired sex - in farming animals but also in human medical practice.

== Methods ==

=== Conventional techniques ===
Several methods have been used to sort sperm before the advent of flow cytometry. [[Density gradient centrifugation]] (in a continuous or discontinuous gradient) can concentrate semen samples with low concentration of sperm, using the density of sperm as a measure of their quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Sofia C.|last2=Sartorius|first2=Gideon|last3=Pletscher|first3=Flurina|last4=Geyter|first4=Maria de|last5=Zhang|first5=Hong|last6=Geyter|first6=Christian de|title=Isolation of spermatozoa with low levels of fragmented DNA with the use of flow cytometry and sorting|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213006407|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|pages=686–694.e4|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.05.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, so-called [[swim-up]] techniques apply a centrifugation step and then sperm is allowed to swim up into a medium, thus enriching a subpopulation of motile sperm. However, use of sperm centrifugation is detrimental to the sperm viability and elicits production of reactive oxygen species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rappa|first=Kari L.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Harold F.|last3=Hakkarainen|first3=Gloria C.|last4=Anchan|first4=Raymond M.|last5=Mutter|first5=George L.|last6=Asghar|first6=Waseem|date=2016-09-01|title=Sperm processing for advanced reproductive technologies: Where are we today?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016300076|journal=Biotechnology Advances|volume=34|issue=5|pages=578–587|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional techniques are routinely used in assisted reproductive technology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paasch|first=Uwe|last2=Grunewald|first2=Sonja|last3=Glander|first3=Hans-Juergen|date=2007-01-01|title=Sperm selection in assisted reproductive techniques|journal=Society of Reproduction and Fertility Supplement|volume=65|pages=515–525|issn=1747-3403|pmid=17644989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flow cytometry ===
[[Flow cytometry]] is another method used to sort sperm and adaptations of this technique opens new opportunities in sperm sorting. However, because flow cytometry-based sperm sorting often uses fluorescent dyes that often stain DNA, the safety of this technique in human reproductive medicine is a matter of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caroppo|first=Ettore|title=Sperm sorting for selection of healthy sperm: is it safe and useful?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213007000|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|pages=695–696|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.006|pmid=23809504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Sofia|last2=Sartorius|first2=Gideon|last3=Geyter|first3=Christian de|title=Sorting of spermatozoa with flow cytometry|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213007395|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.039|page=e15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, flow cytometry is the only currently used technique able to determine the sex of future progeny by measuring DNA content of individual sperm cells. It evaluates if they contain the larger [[X chromosome]] (giving rise to a female offspring) or smaller [[Y chromosome]] (leading to male progeny). It then allows separation of X and Y sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=L. A.|last2=Welch|first2=G. R.|last3=Rens|first3=W.|date=1999-01-01|title=The Beltsville sperm sexing technology: high-speed sperm sorting gives improved sperm output for in vitro fertilization and AI|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=77 Suppl 2|pages=213–220|issn=0021-8812|pmid=15526798|doi=10.2527/1999.77suppl_2213x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called ''[[Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology]]'' was developed by USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, relying on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;Garner DL, Seidel GE. History of commercializing sexed semen for cattle. Theriogenology 2008;69: 886-895.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called [[Hoechst 33342]] which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the "female" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart.  As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa.  As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge).  The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.&lt;ref&gt;Seidel GE, Jr., Garner DL. Current status of sexing mammalian spermatozoa. Reproduction 2002;124: 733-743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cytometric technique used in sperm sorting is [[magnetic-activated cell sorting]] (MACS) which is routinely applied in assisted reproduction hospitals to sort out sperm with fragmented DNA. This is achieved using [[Antibody|antibodies]] to surface markers of programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) such as [[annexin V]], coupled with magnetic beads. Following the binding of these antibodies, spermatozoa which undergo apoptosis are sorted by applying [[magnetic field]] to the sperm suspension.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gil|first=Monica|last2=Sar-Shalom|first2=Valerie|last3=Sivira|first3=Yolisid Melendez|last4=Carreras|first4=Ramon|last5=Checa|first5=Miguel Angel|date=2013-03-07|title=Sperm selection using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) in assisted reproduction: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-013-9962-8|journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=479–485|doi=10.1007/s10815-013-9962-8|issn=1058-0468|pmc=3644127}}&lt;/ref&gt; MACS obviates the need for fluorescent DNA binding molecules.

=== Other techniques ===
[[DNA damage]] in sperm cells may be detected by using [[Raman spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/21982/page1/ Ranking sperm cells could improve the odds of in vitro fertilization.] By Courtney Humphries. TechnologyReview. Wednesday, January 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is not specific enough to detect individual traits, however.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; The sperm cells having least DNA damage may subsequently be injected into the egg cell by [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI).&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; Many other methods for sperm sorting have been proposed or are currently tested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Sperm undergoes a process of [[natural selection]] when millions of sperm enter vagina but only few reach the egg cell and then only one is usually allowed to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] it. The sperm is selected not only by its highest [[Sperm motility|motility]] but also by other factors such as [[DNA integrity]], production of [[reactive oxygen species]] and [[Cell viability|viability]]. This selection is largely circumvented in case of [[in-vitro fertilization]] which leads to higher incidence of [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] associated with [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive techniques]]. Egg cells are often fertilized by sperm which would have low chance of fertilizing it in natural conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sperm sorting could thus be used to decrease risks associated with assisted reproduction. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about using sperm sorting for choosing the child's sex.

=== For general health ===
Conventional methods of sperm sorting have been widely used to assess quality of sperm before subsequent [[artificial insemination]] or [[in-vitro fertilization]]. It has been verified that sperm sorted using these techniques is of superior quality than unsorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aitken|first=R. John|last2=Clarkson|first2=Jane S.|date=1988-11-12|title=Significance of Reactive Oxygen Species and Antioxidants in Defining the Efficacy of Sperm Preparation Techniques|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1939-4640.1988.tb01067.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Andrology|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=367–376|doi=10.1002/j.1939-4640.1988.tb01067.x|issn=1939-4640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Geyter|first=C.|last2=Bals-Pratsch|first2=M.|last3=Doeren|first3=M.|last4=Yeung|first4=C.

New flow-cytometry based techniques such as [[YO-PRO]] staining can discriminate [[Apoptosis|apoptotic]] and dead spermatozoa from the viable ones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, [[annexin V]] staining followed by [[Magnetic-activated cell sorting|MACS]] can significantly improve pregnancy rates in couples with previous assisted reproduction failure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== For sex selection ===

==== In farming ====
Sperm sorting by flow cytometry is an established technique in veterinary practice, and in the dairy industry most female cows are artificially inseminated with sorted semen to increase the number of female [[Calf|calves]] (using sperm sorting is less common in other species of farm animals, however artificial insemination is common).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rath|first=D.|last2=Barcikowski|first2=S.|last3=de Graaf|first3=S.|last4=Garrels|first4=W.|last5=Grossfeld|first5=R.|last6=Klein|first6=S.|last7=Knabe|first7=W.|last8=Knorr|first8=C.|last9=Kues|first9=W.|date=2013-01-01|title=Sex selection of sperm in farm animals: status report and developmental prospects|journal=Reproduction (Cambridge, England)|volume=145|issue=1|pages=R15–30|doi=10.1530/REP-12-0151|issn=1741-7899|pmid=23148085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial insemination of farm animals with sorted sperm is recognized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) as a promising way of increasing efficiency of agriculture needed to produce enough food for the growing human population. Utilizing artificial insemination with sorted sperm is seen as a way to create an optimal ratio of male and female calves to increase dairy [[milk production]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== In humans ====
{{Further information|Sex selection#Ethical concerns}}Choosing the sex of children might help prevent [[Sex-linked inheritance|sex-associated heritable diseases]] such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|Duchene muscular dystrophy]] or [[haemophilia]] in families with a history of these diseases. On the other hand, sperm sorting in humans raises the ethical concerns implicit to the idea of [[sex selection]]. If applied large-scale, it has a potential to elicit a [[Human sex ratio|sex-ratio imbalance]]. It could also have implications on gender equality if parents consistently choose to have a boy as their first-born (first-borns were shown to be more likely to succeed in life).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalfoglou|first=A.L.|last2=Kammersell|first2=M.|last3=Philpott|first3=S.|last4=Dahl|first4=E.|title=Ethical arguments for and against sperm sorting for non-medical sex selection: a review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S147264831200692X|journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online|volume=26|issue=3|pages=231–239|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2012.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early to mid-1980s, [[Glenn Spaulding]] was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort "two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm" was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of [[haploid]] expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 5,021,244, column 9, Sorting Sperm; http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5021244.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5021244&amp;RS=PN/5021244&lt;/ref&gt; Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 5,021,244; 5,346,990; 5,369,012; 5,439,362; 5,496,722; 5,648,468; 5,660,997; PCT/US1989/002069&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the patent filing, both [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories]] and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei,&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Johnson, J. P. Flook, M. V. Look, D. Pinkel, Flow sorting of X and Y chromosome-bearing spermatozoa into two populations. Gamete Research Volume 16, Issue1, pages 1-9, January 1987; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrd.1120160102/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; after the Application Serial Number 35,986 patent filing a new technique was utilized by the USDA where "sperm were briefly sonicated to remove tails".&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Johnson, J. P. Flook and M. V. Look, Flow cytometry of X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm for DNA using an improved preparation method and staining with Hoechst 33342.

There is no country in the world which explicitly permits sex selection for non-medical purposes. There were 31 countries in 2009 which allowed sex selection in case of sex-linked disease risk or other medical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geneticsandsociety.org/downloads/200904_sex_selection_memo.pdf|title=Countries with laws or policies on sex selection|last=Darnovsky|first=Marcy|date=2009|website=|publisher=geneticsandsociety.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, for humans, the application of sperm sorting in sex selection is tightly regulated by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. After the establishment of the MicroSort technique, it was offered to parents as a part of a [[clinical trial]]. The procedure was made available to a limited number of participants each month, in addition to fulfilling certain criteria, such as having a disease with [[sex linkage]] or having at least one child (for family balancing).&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;[http://www.microsort.net/ Genetics &amp; IVF Institute: MicroSort Clinical Trial]&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently MicroSort laboratories and collaborating physicians in several countries (some for general purposes, some only offering service in case of genetic disease risks associated with one sex).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsort.com/?page_id=319|title=About Us {{!}} MicroSort International|last=ThemeFuse|website=www.microsort.com|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While highly accurate, sperm sorting by flow cytometry will not produce two completely separate populations. That is to say, there will always be some "male" sperm among the "female" sperm and vice versa. The exact percentage purity of each population is dependent on the species being sorted and the 'gates' which the operator places around the total population visible to the machine. In general, the larger the DNA difference between the X and Y chromosome of a species, the easier it is to produce a highly pure population. In sheep and cattle, purities for each sex will usually remain above 90% depending on 'gating', while for humans these may be reduced to 90% and 70% for "female" and "male" spermatozoa, respectively.&lt;ref name="institute" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1251">'''Telescoping generations''' can occur in [[parthenogenetic]] species, such as [[aphid]]s or other life forms that have the ability to reproduce without ovum fertilization. This occurrence is characterized by a [[viviparous]] female having a daughter growing inside her that is also parthenogenetically pregnant with a daughter cell.

This pattern of reproduction can also occur in certain [[mite]]s that are not parthenogenetic, e.g. ''[[Adactylidium]]'', in which the young hatch and mate within the mother, eating her from the inside and then escaping; in some species the males never escape, and in others they die shortly afterwards. However, the resulting inbreeding has consequences much like those of parthenogenesis, and the females are not actually pregnant on hatching but become pregnant before emerging into free living.

The '''thanatotranscriptome''' denotes (in the fields of [[biochemistry]], [[microbiology]] and [[biophysics]] of [[thanatology]] and in particular [[forensic]]) all [[ribonucleic acid|RNA]] from the transcript of the part of [[genome]] still active or awakened in the internal organs of a dead body for 24 to 48 hours following the time of the [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Pozhitkov, A.

== Thanatotranscriptomic Analysis ==
It can from a [[serology]] postmortem characterize [[transcriptome]] of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] particular cell type, or compare the transcriptomes between various conditions experimental.

It can be complementary to the analysis of [[thanatomicrobiome]] to better understand the process of transformation of the [[necromass]] in the days following the death;.&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Finley, S. J., Abidin, Z., &amp; Mulle, J. G. (2016) ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4764706/ The Thanatomicrobiome: A Missing Piece of the Microbial Puzzle of Death]''. Frontiers in microbiology, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Characterization and quantification of the transcriptome in a tissue "dead" given and conditions data can identify [[gene]]s assets, to determine the regulatory mechanisms of [[Gene Expression]] and set networks of gene expression.

== Analytical Techniques ==
The techniques commonly used for simultaneously measuring the concentration of a large number of different types of mRNA include [[biochip|Microarray]], high throughput sequencing said RNA [[RNA-Seq]].

== Scientific History ==
Clues to the existence of a post-mortem transcriptome existed at least since the beginning of the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Can, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Soni, S. (2015). ''The apoptotic thanatotranscriptome associated with the liver of cadavers''. Forensic science, medicine, and pathology, 11(4), 509-516.&lt;/ref&gt; but in [[scientific publications]] the word ''thanatotranscriptome'' seems to have been first proposed by Javan et al. in 2015;&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Kwon, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Lee, Y. (2015). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheree_Finley/publication/284233163_Progression_of_Thanatophagy_in_Cadaver_Brain_and_Heart_Tissues/links/567aa20308ae1e63f1df4dc3.pdf Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports].''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Washington]], Peter Noble, Alex Pozhitkov and their colleagues recently (2016) confirmed that up to 2 days (48 hours) after the death of mice or zebrafish, many genes still function in their [[Human body|body]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Anna (2016) “[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2094644-hundreds-of-genes-seen-sparking-to-life-two-days-after-death/ ''Hundreds of genes seen sparking to life two days after death (The discovery that many genes are still working up to 48 hours after death has implications for organ transplants, forensics and our very definition of death)'']”; New Scientist, 21 juin 2016, commentant un article intitulé  “''Genes get active after death''” dont la référence est BioRxiv, DOI: 10.1101/058305; DOI: 10.1101/058370&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;changes in the quantities of [[mRNA]] in the body prove that hundreds of genes with very different functions awoke just after death 548 genes have thus awakened after the death of [[zebrafish]] and 515 in the [[laboratory mice]].&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
Among the genes which thus awake, there are genes involved in the development of the organism, including genes that are normally activated only ''[[in utero]]'' or ''[[in ovo]]'' (in the egg) during fetal development.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

== Applications ==
This information could possibly in the future lead to:

* Construct a definition both more accurate and nuanced phenomenon of "[[death]]";
* More precise time of death by the [[forensic]] (or a biologist or veterinarian in an [[EcoHealth]] investigation who needs information on hours or causes of poisoning, without the case of a [[zoonosis]] for example. &lt;br /&gt;We are far, but if we come to better understand the steps of this phenomenon in the [[Human]], a coroner could via a ''"postmortem serology"''&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, L. I., Tate, C. M., Knott, E. L., McDaniel, J. E., Rogers, S. S., Koons, B. W., ... &amp; Robertson, J. M. (2012). Determination of an effective housekeeping gene for the quantification of mRNA for forensic applications. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 57(4), 1051-1058 ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2012.02086.x/full summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps in the future, according to the dosage of the mRNA, establish with greater precision the time since death (by hour, even in minutes rather than days, which can be useful for investigations to reconstruct the conditions of death&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;).
* Illuminate the phenomenon of [[cell death]] of [[apoptosis]] or the death of a body, and in particular the phenomenon of [[ischemia]] ([[myocardial]] including&lt;ref name= Herrera2013/&gt;) and its process [[healing]] or resilience, for perhaps then to facilitate them. &lt;br /&gt;This gene revival also means remaining in the cells for up to 48 hours after the death of these animals enough energy for activating the cellular machinery.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; At least part of these genes appear to be genes involved in physiological healing, healing or "auto-resuscitation".&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
* Understand cancer. It was found that among the genes reactivated soon after death, some of the genes involved in the process of [[cancerous]] (reactivated with a peak of activity reaches about 24 hours after death&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;) ; detailed understanding of this phenomenon could shed light on the phenomenon of carcinogenesis and maybe bring some new elements to better combat.
* Improving the quality of organ transplants. Indeed, the fact that cancer-related genes are activated after the death in animals is information that leads us to consider the time of organ transplantation to reduce the incidence of cancer in people receiving these transplants.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; Persons to which was grafted a new liver actually more cancers after treatment than would be statistically normal. This phenomenon was attributed to the diet imposed on them, or immunosuppressive drugs they receive for their body does not reject the transplant.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; One hypothesis (yet to be verified) is that the cancer genes activated in the [[liver]] of the [[organ donation|donor]] may also play a role.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
* Whether there is the same in humans, because previous studies have already shown that in people dead by trauma, heart attack or suffocation, various genes including those involved in cardiac muscle contraction and wound healing, were active more than 12 hours after death.&lt;ref name= Herrera2013&gt;González-Herrera, L., Valenzuela, A., Marchal, J. A., Lorente, J. A., &amp; Villanueva, E. (2013). Studies on RNA integrity and gene expression in human myocardial tissue, pericardial fluid and blood, and its postmortem stability. Forensic science international, 232(1), 218-228 ([http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738(13)00378-2/abstract summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly for gene dental pulp.&lt;ref&gt;Poór, V. S., Lukács, D., Nagy, T., Rácz, E., &amp; Sipos, K. (2016). The rate of RNA degradation in human dental pulp reveals post-mortem interval. International journal of legal medicine, 130(3), 615-619 ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-015-1295-y summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors in 2015 introduced the concept of ''"thanatotranscriptome [[apoptosis|apoptotic]]"''&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Can, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Soni, S. (2015). The apoptotic thanatotranscriptome associated with the liver of cadavers.

* Test another hypothesis is that after death, a rapid decrease of the "suppressor genes" activity (which normally inhibit the activation of other genes, including those no longer needed after the fetal stage) would allow dormant genes wake up, at least for this short period of time.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

[[File:Alanna Spence - queen bee (by).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Worker policing is found in [[honey bee]]s and other [[hymenoptera]]ns including some species of [[bumblebee]]s, [[ants]] and [[wasps]].]]

'''Worker policing''' is a behavior seen in colonies of social [[hymenoptera]]ns ([[ants]], [[bees]], and [[wasps]]) whereby [[worker (bee)|worker females]] eat or remove eggs that have been laid by other workers rather than those laid by a queen.  Worker policing ensures that the offspring of the queen will predominate in the group. In certain species of bees, ants and wasps, workers or the queen may also act aggressively towards fertile workers. Worker policing has been suggested as a form of [[coercion]] to promote the evolution of [[altruism in animals|altruistic]] behavior in [[Eusociality|eusocial]] insect societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ratnieks |first=Francis L.

Not all forms of policing require the presence of a queen; it also occurs in a few species of ants which establish a [[dominance hierarchy]] of reproductive female workers, where top-ranking individuals reproduce.&lt;ref name=Selfishpolicing &gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroeymeyt|first=Nathalie |author2=Elisabeth Brunner |author3=Jürgen Heinze|title="Selfish worker policing" controls reproduction in a ''Temnothorax'' ant|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=July 2007|volume=61|issue=9|pages=1449–1457|doi=10.1007/s00265-007-0377-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-007-0377-3?LI=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary basis==
{{See also|Haplodiploidy}}

[[File:Haplodiploid-sex-determination-system3.png|thumb|upright|The [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] sex determination system has consequences for worker policing behavior]]
In many [[Eusociality|social insect]] communities, sex is determined through [[haplodiploidy]]. [[Haploid]] male [[Drone (bee)|drone]]s develop from unfertilized eggs while [[diploid]] females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate with one or several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, it is in the queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.&lt;ref name=Policing.Bee/&gt;

By contrast, the worker shares half of her genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a conflict where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its [[reproductive fitness]].&lt;ref name=Policing.Bee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratnieks|first=Francis L.W.|author2=P. Kirk Visscher |title=Worker policing in the honeybee|journal=Nature|date=December 1989|volume=342|issue=6251|pages=796–797|doi=10.1038/342796a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v342/n6251/abs/342796a0.html|bibcode=1989Natur.342..796R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.

Worker policing occurs when worker bees in the colony are genetically more [[Coefficient of relationship|closely related]] to the queen than the reproductive female. In many instances, the eggs of the female worker are eaten, or she is repeatedly attacked by other workers. This mechanism of egg removal ensures that the queen's sons predominate.&lt;ref name=Resistance&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenseleers|first=Tom|author2=Adam G. Hart |author3=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=When Resistance Is Useless: Policing and the Evolution of Reproductive Acquiescence in Insect Societies|journal=The American Naturalist|date=December 2004|volume=164|issue=6|pages=E154-E167|doi=10.1086/425223|jstor=10.1086/425223|publisher=The University of Chicago Press for The American Society of Naturalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments confirming the role of [[kin selection]] in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, which can lead to lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp ''[[Dolichovespula saxonica]]'' mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Kevin R.|author2=Francis L.W. Ratnieks |title=Social insects: Facultative worker policing in a wasp|journal=Nature|date=October 2000|volume=407|issue=6805|pages=692–693|doi=10.1038/35037665|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6805/full/407692a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although early theories of worker policing focused on the kin selection component, evidence from [[Apis mellifera|honey bees]] suggests that [[altruism]] is sometimes enforced. Fewer workers reproduce as policing effectiveness rises, and policing effectiveness decreases with increasing relatedness except in colonies with no queen.  This suggests that worker policing is a social sanction imposed on [[Gene-centered view of evolution#Selfish-gene theory|selfish individuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenseleers|first=Tom|author2=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=Enforced altruism in insect societies|journal=Nature|date=November 2006|volume=444|issue=7115|pages=50|doi=10.1038/444050a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444050a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed mechanisms for kin recognition==

[[File:Fusca feeding.jpg|thumb|''[[Formica fusca]]'' ants can recognize nest-mates]]

Mechanisms suggested for egg discrimination in worker policing include queen hydrocarbons, fertile worker hydrocarbons, and nestmate recognition.

===Queen hydrocarbons===

A study on the [[carpenter ant]] ''Camponotus floridanus'' found a special surface [[hydrocarbon]] on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups that did not have queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.&lt;ref name=Queen.Hydrocarbon/&gt;

===Fertile worker hydrocarbons===

The study of cuticle hydrocarbons has also been applied to the reproductive workers. In some colonies of the ponerine ant ''[[Platythyrea punctata]]'', the presence of CHCs in new reproductive workers triggered aggressive behavior from the rest of the colony, often between new and old reproductive workers. Specifically, the old reproductive workers rubbed a marker hydrocarbon on the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of the new females, identifying them as rivals and targets for aggression.&lt;ref name=Worker.Hydrocarbon/&gt;

===Nestmate recognition===

In contrast to the other ant species, worker policing in the ant ''[[Formica fusca]]''  appears to incorporate nestmate recognition in addition to the queen hydrocarbons. Workers displayed higher levels of aggression toward non-nest mates and also removed some queen-laid eggs. Thus, queen hydrocarbons were not the only contributor to discrimination of the eggs.&lt;ref name=Nestmate.Recognition/&gt;

==Examples from social Hymenoptera==
Worker policing has [[Convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] in several social insect species. The following cases are examples:

=== Bees ===
[[File:Apis mellifera carnica worker honeycomb 3.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Apis mellifera]]'' workers remove worker-laid eggs by eating them (oophagy)]]

One of the first examples of worker policing to be discovered was in the honey bee, ''[[Apis mellifera]]''. Worker policing is prevalent in most honey bee colonies, and worker reproduction is minimal (0.12%) in this species.&lt;ref name=Quant.Study.Bee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Visscher|first=P. Kirk|title=A quantitative study of worker reproduction in honey bee colonies|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=1989|volume=25|issue=4|pages=247–254|jstor=4600337|doi=10.1007/bf00300050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worker policing occurs via egg-eating ([[oophagy]]) in ''Apis mellifera'' colonies.&lt;ref name=Resistance/&gt; In many of these hives, the activation of ovaries in fertile females is diminished, suggesting that there are disincentives to laying eggs.&lt;ref name=Resistance/&gt;

Workers in colonies of the Asian honey bee, ''[[Apis florea]]'', are also reported to engage in oophagy. Using [[microsatellite]] analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional sterility of otherwise fertile workers.&lt;ref name=wp_a.florea&gt;{{cite journal| last=Halling| first=Luke A|author2=Benjamin P. Oldroyd |author3=Wandee Wattanachaiyingcharoen |author4=Andrew B. Barron |author5=Piyamas Nanork |author6=Siriwat Wongsiri |title=Worker policing in the bee ''Apis florea''| journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology| year=2001| volume=49| issue=6| pages=509–513| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002650100325| doi=10.1007/s002650100325|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A higher percentage of female workers of the bee species ''[[Apis cerana]]'' are reported to activate their ovaries than those of ''Apis mellifera'' or ''Apis florea''. When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to eat the worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.&lt;ref name=wp_a.cerana&gt;{{cite journal| last=Oldroyd| first=Benjamin P.|author2=Luke A. Halling |author3=Gregory Good |author4=Wandee Wattanachaiyingcharoen |author5=Andrew B. Barron |author6=Piyamas Nanork |author7=Siriwat Wongsiri |author8=Francis L. Ratnieks | title=Worker policing and worker reproduction in ''Apis cerana''| journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology| year=2001| volume=50| issue=4| pages=371–377| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002650100376|doi=10.1007/s002650100376| publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observation that all these [[Apis (genus)|Apis]] species engage in [[polyandry]] has led researchers to conclude that worker policing is [[plesiomorphic]] for the Apis genus.&lt;ref name=wp_a.cerana/&gt;

Worker policing also occurs in the primitively eusocial [[bumblebee]]s such as ''[[Bombus terrestris]]''.&lt;ref name=Zanette&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zanette |first1=L. R. |last2=Miller |first2=S. D. |last3=Faria |first3=C. M.|last4=Almond |first4=E. J. |last5=Huggins |first5=T. J.|last6=Jordan |first6=W. C. |last7=Bourke |first7=A.

{{further information|Gamergate}}

In colonies of the ponerine ant, ''Pachycondyla inversa,'' workers eat the eggs of fertile female workers, known as [[gamergate]]s, and display aggressive behavior towards egg-laying females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=D'Ettorre| first=Patrizia|author2=Jürgen Heinze |author3=Francis L W Ratnieks | title=Worker policing by egg eating in the ponerine ant ''Pachycondyla inversa''| journal=Proc Biol Sci|date=July 2004| volume=271| issue=1546| pages=1427–1434| doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2742| pmc=1691738| pmid=15306343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colonies of the ant ''Gnamptogenys menadensis'', workers will sometimes mate and lay eggs while others remain as virgins to lay [[trophic egg]]s to be used as food. In a display of policing, workers can immobilize female reproductive workers by biting their limbs; it is reported that 50% of the victims die from this treatment. The attacking workers may also drag offending workers outside the colony. Since workers can lay both male and female eggs, worker policing could be favored as the cost to the community is large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobin| first=Bruno |author2=J. Billen |author3=C. Peeters| title=Policing behaviour towards virgin egg layers in a polygynous ponerine ant |journal=Anim.

The ant species ''Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica'' also display evidence of policing. When researchers separated and then reunited workers from colonies that did or did not have queens, workers from the queen-containing colonies attacked the workers with activated ovaries from the queenless colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Iwanishi |first=Satoru |author2=Eisuke Hasegawab |author3=Kyohsuke Ohkawaraa| title=Worker oviposition and policing behaviour in the myrmicine ant ''Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica'' Forel| journal=Animal Behaviour |date=September 2003| volume=66| issue=3| pages=513–519| doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2222 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347203922226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the queenless ant ''Streblognathus peetersi'', policing helps to select gamergates. The workers immobilize gamergates with lowered fertility, enabling high-ranking workers to take over as new gamergates.&lt;ref name="GadauFewell2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gadau |first1=Jürgen |last2=Fewell |first2=Jennifer |last3=Wilson |first3=Edward O. |authorlink3=Edward O.

In the ponerine ant ''[[Harpegnathos saltator]]'', worker policing prevents the number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having too many of them would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a [[pheromone]] detected by [[olfaction]]. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liebig |first1=J&amp;uuml;rgen |last2=Peeters |first2=Christian |last3=H&amp;ouml;llldobler |first3=Bert |title=Worker policing limits the number of reproductives in a ponerine ant |journal=Proc.

=== Wasps ===
[[File:GemeineWespe2.jpg|thumb|''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris]]'' workers can display aggression towards other fertile workers]]
The tree wasp ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris]]'' also displays worker policing. Both egg-eating and aggression are reported in these wasp communities, and the queen also engages in the policing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wenseleers| first=Tom |author2=A.

In colonies of the paper wasp, ''[[Polistes chinensis|Polistes chinensis antennalis]]'', workers can lay up to a quarter of the male eggs in the colony. The number of eggs that survived to hatching, however, was minimal compared to the number produced by the queen. Analysis of the microsatellite markers showed that both queens and workers contributed to policing of worker and queen-laid eggs even in [[Monogyny|monogynous]] and monandrous colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Saigo| first=T.|author2=K. Tsuchida | title=Queen and worker policing in monogynous and monandrous colonies of a primitively eusocial wasp|date=December 2004| volume=271| pages=S509–S512| pmc=1810092| pmid=15801618| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0238| journal=Proc Biol Sci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common wasp, ''[[Vespula vulgaris]]'', engages in worker policing, and it is known that a significant number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that relatedness may not be the key factor in the development of worker policing. Rather, it is hypothesized that worker policing has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=Kevin R.|author2=Francis L. W. Ratnieks |title=Convergent evolution of worker policing by egg eating in the honeybee and common wasp|journal=Proc Biol Sci|date=January 2001|volume=268|issue=1463|pages=169–74|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1346|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/268/1463/169.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a test of worker policing, researchers examined the removal of worker-laid eggs in ''[[Vespula rufa]]'', a wasp that has low paternity. Under the testing conditions, worker policing was not as efficient, and some of the drones appeared to be from worker-laid eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wenseleers| first=Tom|author2=N. S. Badcock |author3=K. Erven |author4=A. Tofilski |author5=F. S. Nascimento |author6=A. G. Hart |author7=T. A. Burke |author8=M. E. Archer |author9=F. L W.

The [[European Hornet]], ''Vespa crabro'', was previously thought to be under reproductive pheromone control by the queen, thus explaining why the other females didn't reproduce, even though they were capable of doing so.  Experiments by Foster showed that the workers were instead regulating sterility in each other, thus instead exhibiting worker policing.  While each worker is capable of reproducing, the colony as a whole is more efficient and organized if the workers allow only the queen to lay larvae.&lt;ref name="police"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Foster, K.R., Gulliver, J., Ratnieks, F.L.W.| title=Worker policing in the European hornet Vespa crabro| journal=Insectes Sociaux| year=2002 |  volume=49 | issue=1 | pages=41–44 | doi=10.1007/s00040-002-8277-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Synoeca cyanea]]'' also engage in worker policing during times when queen repopulation is not needed. They will prevent females from laying eggs through aggressive behavior and egg-eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Morphological and Physiological Caste Differences in Synoeca cyanea (Hymenoptero, Vespidae, Epiponini) According to the Ontogenetic Development of the Colonies|last = Noda|first = Silvia Cristina Mari|date = 2003|journal = Sociobiology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exceptions ==

===Anarchic syndrome===

Very rarely, female worker bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, in a process known as the anarchic syndrome. Female reproductive workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even in the presence of a queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they [[mimicry|mimic]] queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.&lt;ref name=Anarchic.Syndrome /&gt;

===Selfish worker policing===

''[[Temnothorax unifasciatus]]'', a [[Myrmicinae|myrmicinid]] ant, has been shown not to have collective worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]]. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.&lt;ref name=Selfishpolicing /&gt;

This type of policy is common in [[Dolichovespula norwegica]] wasps where despite being more related to other workers’ sons, worker-laid eggs were consumed by other workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Co-occurrence of three types of egg policing in the Norwegian wasp Dolichovespsula wasp|last = Bonckaert|first = W.|date = 2001|journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|doi = 10.1007/s00265-010-1064-3|pmid = |last2 = Tofilski|first2 = A.|last3 = Nascimento|first3 = F.S.|last4 = Billen|first4 = J.|last5 = Ratnieks|first5 = F.L.W.|last6 = Wenseleers|first6 = T. |volume=65 |pages=633–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worker policing without genetic conflict===

In the [[Thelytoky|thelytokous]] ant ''Platythyrea punctata'', colonies are [[cloning|clonal]]; therefore, workers are all equally related genetically, and worker policing is not expected as there is no genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=Anne|author2=J. Wantia |author3=J. A. Torres |author4=J. Heinze | title=Worker policing without genetic conflicts in a clonal ant| journal=PNAS|date=October 2003| volume=100| issue=22| pages=12836–12840| doi=10.1073/pnas.2132993100| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/22/12836.abstract | pmid=14557542 | pmc=240705}}&lt;/ref&gt;
