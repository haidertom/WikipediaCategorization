First, the predators approach their potential prey. Predators bite or try to swallow the hagfishes, but the hagfishes have already projected jets of slime (arrows) into the predators' mouths. Choking, the predators release the hagfishes and gag in an attempt to remove slime from their mouths and gill chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zintzen | first1=Vincent | last2=Roberts | first2=Clive D. | last3=Anderson | first3=Marti J. | last4=Stewart | first4=Andrew L. | last5=Struthers | first5=Carl D. | last6=Harvey | first6=Euan S. | title=Hagfish Slime as a Defense Mechanism against Gill-breathing Predators | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=1 | page=2011 | doi=10.1038/srep00131| year=2011 | bibcode=2011NatSR...1E.131Z | pmid=22355648 | pmc=3216612}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Anti-predator adaptations''' are mechanisms developed through [[evolution]] that assist [[prey]] organisms in their constant struggle against [[predator]]s. Throughout the animal kingdom, adaptations have evolved for every stage of this struggle, namely by avoiding detection, warding off attack, fighting back, or escaping when caught.

The first line of defence consists in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as [[camouflage]], [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerade]], [[apostatic selection]], living underground, or [[nocturnal]]ity. 

Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in [[aposematism]], by [[mimicry|mimicking]] animals which do possess such defences, by [[deimatic behaviour|startling]] the attacker, by [[signalling theory|signalling to the predator]] that pursuit is not worthwhile, by [[distraction display|distraction]], by using defensive structures such as spines, and by [[social animal|living in a group]]. Members of groups are at [[selfish herd theory|reduced risk of predation]], despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and the likelihood that the predator will attack some other individual.

Some prey species are capable of fighting back against predators, whether [[autohaemorrhaging|with chemicals]], through [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|communal defence]], or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. 

Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by [[autotomy|sacrificing certain body parts]]: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.

==Avoiding detection==

===Staying out of sight===
{{main article|Nocturnality}}
[[File:Seychelles Fruit Bat - Pteropus seychellensis.jpg|thumb|[[Fruit bat]]s forage [[nocturnality|by night]] to avoid predators.]]

Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether [[Troglobite|in caves]], [[Fossorial|underground]], or by being [[nocturnality|nocturnal]].&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cott, H.B. |date=1940 |title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals |publisher=Methuen |location=London |pages=330–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duverge | first1=P.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G | last3=Rydell | first3=J. | last4=Ransome | first4=R. | date=2000 | title=Functional significance of emergence timing in bats | journal=Ecography | volume=23 | pages=32–40 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0587.2000.tb00258.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Daly | first1=M. | last2=Behrends | first2=P.R. | last3=Wilson | first3=M. | last4=Jacobs | first4=L. | date=1992 | title=Behavioural modulation of predation risk: moonlight avoidance and crepuscular compensation in a nocturnal desert rodent, Dipodomys merriami | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=44 | pages=1–9 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called [[crypsis]] used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating [[bats]]. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from [[bat hawk]]s and [[bat falcon]]s. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.&lt;ref name="Duverge, P.L. 2000"/&gt;
Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in [[kangaroo rat]]s, which avoid moonlight. They forage in relatively open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.&lt;ref name="Daly M. 1992"/&gt;

[[File:Phrynosoma mcallii.jpg|thumb|right|[[Camouflage]] illustrated by the [[flat-tail horned lizard]], its flattened, fringed and [[disruptively patterned]] body eliminating shadow]]

===Camouflage===
{{main article|Camouflage}}

[[Camouflage]] uses any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, [[disruptive coloration]], shadow elimination by [[countershading]] or [[counter-illumination]], self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and colour.{{sfn|Cott|1940}}{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=35–60}} Animals such as the [[flat-tail horned lizard]] of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and blend in with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. In addition, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.&lt;ref name=Sherbrooke117&gt;{{cite book | author=Sherbrooke, W. C. |date=2003 | title=Introduction to horned lizards of North America | publisher=University of California Press |pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masquerade===
[[File:Kallima inachus qtl1.jpg|thumb|''[[Kallima inachus]]'' [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as a dead leaf]]

Animals can hide in plain sight by [[Masquerade (biology)|masquerading]] as inedible objects. For example, the [[potoo]], a South American bird, habitually perches on a tree, convincingly resembling a broken stump of a branch,{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=53–55}} while a butterfly, ''[[Kallima]]'', looks just like a dead leaf.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=318–320}}

===Apostatic selection===

Another way to remain unattacked in plain sight is to look different from other members of the same species. Predators such as [[Parus|tits]] selectively hunt for abundant types of insect, ignoring less common types that were present, forming [[search image]]s of the desired prey. This creates a mechanism for negative [[frequency-dependent selection]], [[apostatic selection]].{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=61–65}}

==Warding off attack==
[[File:Gottesanbeterin Abwehr.JPG|thumb|A Mediterranean [[mantis]], ''[[Iris oratoria]]'', attempting to startle a predator with [[deimatic behaviour]]]]

Many species make use of behavioral strategies to deter predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper |first1=William E |title=Antipredatory Behavior |url=http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/antipredatory_behavior_1/story.htm |website=IDEA |publisher=University of California, Riverside |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Startling the predator===
{{main article|Deimatic behaviour}}

Many weakly-defended animals, including [[moth]]s, [[butterflies]], [[Mantidae|mantises]], [[Phasmidae|phasmids]], and [[cephalopods]] such as octopuses, make use of patterns of threatening or [[deimatic behaviour|startling behaviour]], such as suddenly displaying conspicuous [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]], so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. In the absence of toxins or other defences, this is essentially bluffing, in contrast to aposematism which involves honest signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |author=Stevens, Martin |authorlink=Martin Stevens (biologist) |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |date=2005 |pages=573–588 |pmid=16221330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/86053.html | title=Deimatic Behavior | publisher=Springer | date=2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012 | author=Edmunds, Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.conchsoc.org/node/6014 | title=Octopus vulgaris. Dymantic display | publisher=The Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland | date=3 December 2012 | accessdate=1 January 2013 | author=Smith, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pursuit-deterrent signals===
{{further information|Signalling theory}}
[[File:Stotting gazelle.jpg|thumb|An [[impala]] [[stotting]], [[signalling honestly]] to the predator that the chase will be unprofitable]]

Pursuit-deterrent signals are behavioral signals used by prey that convince predators not to pursue them. For example, [[gazelle]]s [[stotting|stot]], jumping high with stiff legs and an arched back. This is thought to signal to predators that they have a high level of fitness and can outrun the predator. As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caro, T. M. |authorlink=Tim Caro |date=1986 |title=The functions of stotting in Thomson's gazelles: Some tests of the predictions |journal=Animal Behaviour |issue=3 |pages=663–684 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5 |volume=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[White-tailed deer]] and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous (often black and white) tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bildstein |first1=Keith L. |title=Why White-Tailed Deer Flag Their Tails |journal=The American Naturalist |date=May 1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=709–715 |doi=10.1086/284096 |jstor=2460873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warning calls given by birds such as the [[Eurasian jay]] are similarly [[honest signal]]s, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed that it has been detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bergstrom |first=C. T. |last2=Lachmann |first2=M. |year=2001 |title=Alarm calls as costly signals of antipredator vigilance: the watchful babbler game |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=535–543 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Getty |first=T. |year=2002 |title=The discriminating babbler meets the optimal diet hawk |journal=Anim. Behav. |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=397H. Carl 402 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playing dead===
{{main article|apparent death}}
[[File:Heterodon platirhinos 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eastern hog-nosed snake]] [[Apparent death|playing dead]]]]

Another pursuit-deterrent signal is [[apparent death|thanatosis or playing dead]]. Thanatosis is a form of bluff in which an animal mimics its own dead body, [[deception|feigning]] death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.&lt;ref name=Pasteur&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pasteur | first1=G | date=1982 | title=A classificatory review of mimicry systems | url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=13 | pages=169–199 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of this is seen in white-tailed deer fawns, which experience a drop in heart rate in response to approaching predators. This response, referred to as "alarm bradycardia", causes the fawn's heart rate to drop from 155 to 38 beats per minute within one beat of the heart. This drop in heart rate can last up to two minutes, causing the fawn to experience a depressed breathing rate and decrease in movement, called tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a reflex response that causes the fawn to enter a low body position that simulates the position of a dead corpse. Upon discovery of the fawn, the predator loses interest in the "dead" prey. Other symptoms of alarm bradycardia, such as salivation, urination, and defecation, can also cause the predator to lose interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alboni | first1=Paolo | last2=Alboni | first2=Marco | last3=Bertorelle | first3=Giorgio | date=2008 | title=The origin of vasovagal syncope: to protect the heart or to escape predation? | journal=Clinical Autonomic Research | volume=18 | issue=4| pages=170–8 | doi=10.1007/s10286-008-0479-7| pmid=18592129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction===
[[File:Charadrius vociferus tx1.jpg|thumb|A [[killdeer]] plover, [[distraction display|distracting a predator]] from its nest by feigning a broken wing]]
{{main article|phagomimicry|distraction display}}

Marine [[mollusc]]s such as [[sea hare]]s, [[cuttlefish]], [[squid]] and [[octopus]]es give themselves a last chance to escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may [[phagomimicry|mimic food]] or otherwise confuse predators.&lt;ref name="Mason 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2005/03/sea-hares-lose-their-lunch |title=Sea Hares Lose Their Lunch |author=Inman, Mason |date=29 March 2005 |website=Sciencemag.org |accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Derby&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Derby |first1=Charles D. |title=Escape by Inking and Secreting: Marine Molluscs Avoid Predators Through a Rich Array of Chemicals and Mechanisms |journal=The Biological Bulletin |date=December 2007 |volume=213 |issue=3 |pages=274–289 |doi=10.2307/25066645|jstor=25066645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a predator, animals in these groups release [[cephalopod ink|ink]], creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.&lt;ref name="Mason 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Derby, Kicklighter et al (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115142409/http://www2.gsu.edu/~biocdd/Publications/Reprints/2007/Derby%20et%20al%20joun%20chem%20eco%202007.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2009 |url=https://www2.gsu.edu/~biocdd/Publications/Reprints/2007/Derby%20et%20al%20joun%20chem%20eco%202007.pdf |title=Chemical Composition of Inks of Diverse Marine Molluscs Suggests Convergent Chemical Defenses |author=Derby, Charles D. |author2=Kicklighter, Cynthia E. |author3=Johnson,  P.

[[Distraction display]]s attract the attention of predators away from an object, typically the nest or young, that is being protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barrows, Edward M. |date=2001 |title=Animal behavior |publisher=CRC Press |edition=2nd |page=177 | isbn=0-8493-2005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distraction displays are performed by some species of birds, which may feign a broken wing while hopping about on the ground, and by some species of fish.{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

===Mimicry and aposematism===
{{main article|mimicry|aposematism}}
[[File:BatesMimButter.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Viceroy and monarch butterflies illustrate Müllerian mimicry|[[Viceroy butterfly|Viceroy]] and [[monarch butterfly|monarch]] are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]], similar in appearance, unpalatable to predators.]]

[[Mimicry]] occurs when an organism (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in the mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Endler, J. A. |title=An overview of the relationships between mimicry and crypsis |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |date=1981 |volume=16 |pages=25–31 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1981.tb01840.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve [[aposematic]] [[animal coloration|coloration]]&lt;!--this means a pattern of more than one color--&gt;, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.&lt;ref name=HolmgrenEnquist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritland1/&gt;

In [[Batesian mimicry]], a palatable, harmless prey species mimics the appearance of another species that is noxious to predators, thus reducing the mimic's risk of attack.&lt;ref name=HolmgrenEnquist&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holmgren, H. | author2=Enquist, M. | title=Dynamics of mimicry evolution | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | date=1999 | volume=66  | pages=145–158 | doi=10.1006/bijl.1998.0269}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mimicry is seen in many [[insect]]s. The idea behind Batesian mimicry is that predators that have tried to eat the unpalatable species learn to associate its colors and markings with an unpleasant taste. This results in the predator learning to avoid species displaying similar colours and markings, including Batesian mimics, which are in effect parasitic on the chemical or other defences of the unprofitable models.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bates | first1=H.

[[File:Erethizon dorsatum du Québec.jpg|thumb|The porcupine ''[[Erethizon dorsatum]]'' combines sharp [[spine (zoology)|spines]] with [[warning coloration]]]]

===Defensive structures===

Many animals are protected against predators with armour in the form of hard shells (such as most [[mollusc]]s), leathery or scaly skin (as in [[reptile]]s), or tough chitinous exoskeletons (as in [[arthropod]]s).{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|page=198}}

A [[spine (zoology)|spine]] is a sharp, needle-like structure used to inflict pain on predators. An example of this seen in nature is in the [[Sohal surgeonfish]]. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine on the front of each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds.

Many species of slug caterpillar, [[Limacodidae]], have numerous protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces.

==Safety in numbers==
{{further information|Social animal}}

Group living can decrease the risk of predation to the individual in a variety of ways,{{sfn|Edmunds|1974|pages=202–207}} as described below.

===Dilution effect===

A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group "dilute" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] and [[W.D. Hamilton]] proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in [[Camargue horse]]s in Southern France. The [[horse-fly]] often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Duncan | first1=P. | last2=Vigne | first2=N. | date=1979 | title=The effect of group size in horses on the rate of attacks by blood-sucking flies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=27 | pages=623–625 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(79)90201-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water striders]] are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Foster | first1=W.A. | last2=Treherne | first2=J.E. | date=1981 | title=Evidence for the dilution effect in the selfish herd from fish predation on a marine insect | journal=Nature | volume=295 | pages=466–467 | doi=10.1038/293466a0| bibcode=1981Natur.293..466F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domain of Danger Graphic.jpg|thumb|In a group, prey seek central positions in order to reduce their domain of danger. Individuals along the outer edges of the group are more at risk of being targeted by the predator.]]

===Selfish herd===

{{main article|Selfish herd theory}}

The selfish herd theory was proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton]] to explain why animals seek central positions in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Hamilton | authorlink=W. D. Hamilton | first1=W. | title=Geometry for the selfish herd | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=295–311 | date=1971 | pmid=5104951 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory's central idea is to reduce the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group in which the individual is more likely to be attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals are predicted to strive constantly to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied [[brown fur seal]] predation from [[great white shark]]s. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.&lt;ref name="De Vos ORiain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last=De Vos | first=A. | last2=O'Riain | first2=M. J. | title=Sharks shape the geometry of a selfish seal herd: experimental evidence from seal decoys | journal=Biology Letters | volume=6 | issue=1 | date=September 2009 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0628 | pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predator satiation===
[[File:White cicada.jpg|thumb|left|A newly emerged [[Magicicada|periodical cicada]]: millions emerge at once, at long intervals, likely to [[predator satiation|satiate predators]].]]

{{main article|Predator satiation|Periodical cicada}}

A radical strategy for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill a large majority of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the [[periodical cicadas]], which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so [[predator satiation]] is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Williams, K.S. |author2=C. Simon |last-author-amp=yes |date=1995 |title=The ecology, behavior, and evolution of periodical cicadas |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=40 |pages=269–295 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.001413 |url=http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/projects/cicada/resources/reprints/Williams%26Simon_1995.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chlorocebus pygerythrus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chlorocebus pygerythrus|Vervet monkeys]] have different [[alarm signal]]s that warn of attacks by [[eagle]]s, [[leopard]]s and [[snake]]s.]]

===Alarm calls===

{{main article|Alarm signal}}

Animals that live in groups often give [[alarm signal|alarm calls]] that give warning of an attack. For example, [[vervet monkey]]s give different calls depending on the nature of the attack: for an [[eagle]], a disyllabic cough; for a [[leopard]] or other cat, a loud bark; for a [[python (genus)|python]] or other snake, a "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1=John|author1link=John Maynard Smith|last2=Harper|first2=David|title=Animal Signals|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19852-685-8|pages=113–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improved vigilance===

[[File:Circus hudsonius Recurvirostra americana.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4&lt;!--width for low image--&gt;|A raptor, a [[Circus hudsonius|northern harrier]], chases up an alert flock of [[Recurvirostra americana|American avocets]].]]

In the improved vigilance effect, groups are able to detect predators sooner than solitary individuals.{{sfn|Caro|2005|pages=115–149}} For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, [[Common wood pigeon|wood pigeon]] flocks are preyed upon by [[goshawk]]s. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more likely it is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(73)90184-7|pmid=4734745|author=Pulliam, H. R.|title=On the advantages of flocking|volume=38|year=1973|journal=J. Theor. Biol.|pages=419–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild [[ostrich]]es in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises its head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80030-3|title=Vigilance and group size in ostriches|journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=28|issue=1|pages=278–286|author=Bertram, Brian C. |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zebras Serengeti.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;|A single [[zebra]] is hard to catch amongst a herd.]]

===Predator confusion===

Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The [[zebra]] has been suggested by the zoologist [[Martin Stevens (biologist)|Martin Stevens]] and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering [[motion dazzle]] effect in the eye of the predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81|title=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses|pmid=22117898 | volume=9|pmc=3257203|year=2011|journal=BMC Biol.|pages=81 | last1 = Stevens | first1 = M | last2 = Searle | first2 = WT | last3 = Seymour | first3 = JE | last4 = Marshall | first4 = KL | last5 = Ruxton | first5 = GD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting back==

Defensive structures such as spines may be used both to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator.&lt;ref name="Vincent1986"/&gt; Methods of fighting back include chemical defences,{{sfn|Ruxton|Sherratt|Speed|2004|pages=64–69}} mobbing,&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt; defensive regurgitation,&lt;ref name="Warham, John 1977"/&gt; and suicidal altruism.&lt;ref name="Davidson, D.W. 2011"/&gt;

===Chemical defences===

Some prey animals are able to eject noxious materials to deter predators actively.

[[File:MuskOxen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7&lt;!--size for very low image--&gt;|Group of [[muskox]]en in defensive formation, horns ready, and highly alert]]

In communal defence, prey groups actively defend themselves by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing themselves to be passive victims of predation. [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|Mobbing]] is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, [[red colobus]] monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by [[chimpanzees]], a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stanford | first1=Craig B | title=The influence of chimpanzee predation on group size and anti-predator behavior in red colobus monkeys | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=49 | issue=3| pages=577–587 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)90033-0| year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fieldfares]] are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies.

===Defensive regurgitation===

The '''balance of nature''' is a theory that proposes that ecological systems are usually in a stable equilibrium or [[homeostasis]], which is to say that a small change in some particular parameter (the size of a particular population, for example) will be corrected by some [[negative feedback]] that will bring the parameter back to its original "point of balance" with the rest of the system.  It may apply where populations depend on each other, for example in predator/prey systems, or relationships between herbivores and their food source.  It is also sometimes applied to the relationship between the Earth's ecosystem, the composition of the atmosphere, and the world's weather.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] is a balance of nature-based theory that suggests that the Earth and its ecology may act as co-ordinated systems in order to maintain the balance of nature.

The theory that nature is permanently in balance has been largely discredited by scientists working in [[ecology]], as it has been found that chaotic changes in population levels are common, but nevertheless the idea continues to be popular in the general public.&lt;ref name="Zim"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/16/4/393.abstract| title=Ambiguous, circular and polysemous: students' definitions of the "balance of nature" metaphor| journal=Public Understanding of Science| date=October 2007| first=Corinne| last= Zimmerman| volume= 16| number= 4| pages=393–406| doi= 10.1177/0963662505063022| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kricher2009&gt;{{cite book| author=Kricher, John | year=2009 | title=The Balance of Nature: Ecology's Enduring Myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0691138985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later half of the twentieth century the theory was superseded by [[catastrophe theory]] and [[chaos theory]].

==History of the theory==
The concept that nature maintains its condition is of ancient provenance; [[Herodotus]] commented on the wonderful relationship between predator and prey species, which remained in a steady proportion to one another, with predators never excessively consuming their prey populations.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "balance of nature" concept once ruled ecological research, as well as once governing the management of natural resources. This led to a [[doctrine]] popular among some [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s that nature was best left to its own devices, and that [[human]] intervention into it was by definition unacceptable.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/science/new-eye-on-nature-the-real-constant-is-eternal-turmoil.html| title=New Eye on Nature: The Real Constant Is Eternal Turmoil| newspaper=The New York Times| first=William K. |last=Stevens| date=31 July 1990| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of a "balance of nature" was already questioned in the early 1900s, but the general abandonment of the theory by scientists working in [[ecology]] only happened in the last quarter of that century when studies showed that it did not match what could be observed among plant and animal populations.&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Heneghan, Liam | url=https://aeon.co/essays/nature-is-out-of-balance-but-it-s-still-worth-saving |title=Out of kilter | publisher=aeon | date=9 October 2012  | accessdate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predator prey interactions==
Predator-prey populations tend to show [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior within limits, where the sizes of populations change in a way that may appear random, but is in fact obeying [[Determinism|deterministic]] laws based only on the relationship between a population and its food source illustrated by the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]].  An experimental example of this was shown in an eight-year study on small [[Baltic Sea]] creatures such as [[plankton]], which were isolated from the rest of the ocean. Each member of the [[food web]] was shown to take turns multiplying and declining, even though the scientists kept the outside conditions constant. An article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated; "Advanced mathematical techniques proved the indisputable presence of chaos in this food web ... short-term prediction is possible, but long-term prediction is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Human intervention==
Although some conservationist organizations argue that human activity is incompatible with a balanced ecosystem, there are numerous examples in history showing that several modern day habitats originate from human activity: some of Latin America's rain forests owe their existence to humans planting and transplanting them, while the abundance of grazing animals in the [[Serengeti]] plain of Africa is thought by some ecologists to be partly due to human-set fires that created [[savanna]] habitats.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

Possibly one of the best examples of an ecosystem fundamentally modified by human activity can be observed as a consequence of the Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] practice of "[[Fire-stick farming]]". The legacy of this practice over long periods has resulted in forests being converted to grasslands capable of sustaining larger populations of faunal prey, particularly in the northern and western regions of the continent. So thorough has been the effect of these deliberate regular burnings that many plant and tree species from affected regions have now completely adapted to the annual fire regime in that they require the passage of a fire before their seeds will even germinate. One school in Los Angeles states, " “We have let our kids go to the forest area of the playground. However, five years later, we found that none of the flowers were growing, the natural damp soil had been hardened, and all of the beautiful grass had been plucked,”.

==Continued popularity of the theory==
Despite being discredited among ecologists, the theory is widely held to be true by the general public, with one authority calling it an "enduring myth".&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt; At least in [[Midwestern America]], the "balance of nature" idea was shown to be widely held by both science majors and the general student population.&lt;ref name="Zim" /&gt; In a study at the [[University of Patras]], educational sciences students were asked to reason about the future of ecosystems which suffered human-driven disturbances. Subjects agreed that it was very likely for the ecosystems to fully recover their initial state, referring to either a 'recovery process' which restores the initial 'balance', or specific 'recovery mechanisms' as an ecosystem's inherent characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ergazaki|first=Marida|last2=Ampatzidis|first2=Georgios|date=2012-06-01|title=Students’ Reasoning about the Future of Disturbed or Protected Ecosystems &amp;amp; the Idea of the ‘Balance of Nature’|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|journal=Research in Science Education|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=511–530|doi=10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|issn=0157-244X|bibcode=2012RScEd..42..511E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 study, Ampatzidis and Ergazaki discuss the learning objectives and design criteria that a learning environment for non-biology major students should meet to support them challenge the "balance of nature" idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ampatzidis|first=Georgios|last2=Ergazaki|first2=Marida|date=2017-10-01|title=Toward an “Anti-Balance of Nature” Learning Environment for Non-Biology Major Students: Learning Objectives and Design Criteria|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/nse/abstracts/46/1/170016|journal=Natural Sciences Education|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.4195/nse2017.07.0016|issn=1059-9053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big History arose from a desire to go beyond the specialized and self-contained fields that emerged in the 20th century. It tries to grasp history as a whole, looking for common themes across multiple time scales in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History |first=David |last=Christian |page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Changing Image of the Sciences |first=Ida H. |last=Stamhuis |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional history typically begins with the invention of writing, and is limited to past events relating directly to the [[human race]]. Big Historians point out that this limits study to the past 5,000 years and neglects the much longer time when humans existed on Earth. Henry Kannberg sees Big History as being a product of the [[Information Age]], a stage in history itself following speech, writing, and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kannberg| first1=Henry| title=Optimism| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/197069825/OPTIMISM-optitunity| website=Scribd| accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big History covers the formation of the universe, stars, and galaxies, and includes the beginning of life as well as the period of several hundred thousand years when humans were hunter-gatherers. It sees the transition to civilization as a gradual one, with many causes and effects, rather than an abrupt transformation from uncivilized static cavemen to dynamic civilized farmers.&lt;ref name=tws2M23/&gt; An account in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' describes what it [[polemic]]ally asserts to be the conventional "history" view:

{{Quote|Early humans were slump-shouldered, slope-browed, hairy brutes. They hunkered over campfires and ate scorched meat. Sometimes they carried [[spear]]s. Once in a while they scratched pictures of [[antelope]]s on the walls of their caves. That's what I learned during elementary school, anyway. History didn't start with the first humans - they were [[cavemen]]! The [[Stone Age]] wasn't history; the Stone Age was a preamble to history, a [[dystopia]]n era of stasis before the happy onset of civilization, and the arrival of nifty developments like chariot wheels, gunpowder, and Google. History started with agriculture, nation-states, and written documents. History began in [[Mesopotamia]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]], somewhere around 4000 BC. It began when we finally overcame our savage legacy, and culture surpassed biology.|Anthony Doerr reviewing ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, 2007&lt;ref name=tws2M23&gt;{{cite news

Big History, in contrast to conventional history, has more of an interdisciplinary basis.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; Advocates sometimes view conventional history as "microhistory" or "shallow history", and note that three-quarters of historians specialize in understanding the last 250 years while ignoring the "long march of human existence."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; However, one historian disputed that the discipline of history has overlooked the big view, and described the "grand narrative" of Big History as a "cliché that gets thrown around a lot."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that conventional history had the "sense of grinding the nuts into an ever finer powder."&lt;ref name=tws2M14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the mix of individual action and social and environmental forces, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; While conventional history might see an invention such as sharper spear points as being deliberately created by some smart humans, and then copied by other humans, a Big History perspective might see sharper spear points as accidental, and then natural evolutionary processes enabled their users to be better hunters, even if they did not understand why this was the case.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt; It seeks to discover repeating patterns during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, one pattern is that "chaos catalyzes creativity", such as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|asteroid impact]] wiping out the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;

===Time scales and questions===
Big History makes comparisons based on different time scales, or what David Christian calls "the play of scales", and notes similarities and differences between the human, geological, and cosmological scales. Christian believes such "radical shifts in perspective" will yield "new insights into familiar historical problems, from the [[nature versus nurture|nature/nurture debate]] to [[environmental history]] to the fundamental nature of change itself."&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; It shows how human existence has been changed by both human-made and natural factors: for example, according to natural processes which happened more than four billion years ago, [[iron]] emerged from the remains of an exploding star and, as a result, humans could use this hard metal to forge weapons for hunting and war.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt; The discipline addresses such questions as "How did we get here?," "How do we decide what to believe?," "How did Earth form?," and "What is life?"&lt;ref name=tws2M31/&gt; It offers a "grand tour of all the major scientific paradigms."&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; According to one view, it helps students to become [[scientific literacy|scientifically literate]] quickly.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

===Cosmic evolution===
{{Nature timeline}}
[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|Cosmic evolution]], the scientific study of universal change, is closely related to Big History (as are the allied subjects of the [[epic of evolution]] and [[astrobiology]]); some researchers regard cosmic evolution as broader than Big History since the latter mainly (and rightfully) examines the specific historical trek from Big Bang → [[Milky Way]] → Sun → Earth → humanity. Cosmic evolution, while fully addressing all complex systems (and not merely those that led to humans), which is also sometimes called cosmological history or [[universal history]], has been taught and researched for decades, mostly by [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]]. This Big-Bang-to-humankind scenario well preceded the subject that some historians began calling Big History in the 1990s. Cosmic evolution is an intellectual framework that offers a grand synthesis of the many varied changes in the assembly and composition of radiation, matter, and life throughout the history of the universe. While engaging the time-honored queries of who we are and whence we came, this interdisciplinary subject attempts to unify the sciences within the entirety of [[natural history]]—a single, inclusive scientific narrative of the origin and evolution of all material things over ~14 billion years, from the origin of the universe to the present day on Earth.

The roots of the idea of cosmic evolution extend back millennia. Ancient Greek philosophers of the fifth century BCE, most notably [[Heraclitus]], are celebrated for their reasoned claims that all things change. Early modern speculation about cosmic evolution began more than a century ago, including the broad insights of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Lawrence Henderson]]. Only in the mid-20th century was the cosmic-evolutionary scenario articulated as a research paradigm to include empirical studies of galaxies, stars, planets, and life—in short, an expansive agenda that combines physical, biological, and cultural evolution. [[Harlow Shapley]] widely articulated the idea of cosmic evolution (often calling it "[[cosmography]]") in public venues at mid-century,&lt;ref&gt;Palmeri, J., "Bringing Cosmos to Culture: Harlow Shapley and the Uses of Cosmic Evolution," in ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', Dick, S.J and Lupsella, M.L. (eds.), NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] embraced it in the late 20th century as part of its more limited [[astrobiology]] program. [[Carl Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, C., ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]'', Random House, 1980, {{ISBN|0-394-50294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Chaisson]],&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E., ''Cosmic Dawn: The Origins of Matter and Life'', [[Atlantic Monthly]]/[[Little, Brown]], 1981, {{ISBN|0-316-13590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Reeves]],&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H., ''Patience dans l'azur: L'evolution cosmique'', [[Éditions du Seuil]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich Jantsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Jantsch, E., ''The Self-Organizing Universe'', [[Pergamon Press|Pergamon]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Preston Cloud]],&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, P., ''Cosmos, Earth, and Man'', [[Yale Univ. Press]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; among others, extensively championed cosmic evolution at roughly the same time around 1980. This extremely broad subject now continues to be richly formulated as both a technical research program and a scientific worldview for the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], [[Harvard Univ. Press]], 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S.J., and Lupsella, M.L., ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S. and Strick, J., ''The Living Universe'', [[Rutgers University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-8135-3733-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution can elicit controversy for several reasons: [[evolution]] of any kind inherently attracts detractors, especially among religious [[fundamentalists]]; cosmic evolution addresses universal and human origins, which often elevate emotions; it challenges age-old ideas about life's sense of place in the cosmos; it embraces change, which many people dislike or distrust; it welcomes a broad interpretation of the concept of evolution, replacing the idea of evolution exclusive to life, which some biologists prefer; it proposes a sweeping, interdisciplinary worldview based on [[rationality]] and [[empiricism]], which, despite its experimental tests, some find intellectually arrogant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

One popular collection of scholarly materials on cosmic evolution is based on teaching and research that has been underway at [[Harvard University]] since the mid-1970s&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/AnthologyBH_article.pdf "Researching and Teaching Cosmic Evolution,"] in ''From Big Bang to Global Civilization: A Big History Anthology'', Rodriguez, Grinin, Korotayev, (eds.), [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity, energy, thresholds===
Cosmic evolution is a quantitative subject, whereas big history typically is not; this is because cosmic evolution is practiced mostly by natural scientists, while big history by social scholars. These two subjects, closely allied and overlapping, benefit from each other; cosmic evolutionists tend to treat universal history linearly, thus humankind enters their story only at the most very recent times, whereas big historians tend to stress humanity and its many cultural achievements, granting human beings a larger part of their story. One can compare and contrast these different emphases by watching two short movies portraying the Big-Bang-to-humankind narrative, one animating time linearly, and the other  capturing time (actually look-back time) logarithmically; in the former, humans enter this 14-minute movie in the last second, while in the latter we appear much earlier—yet both are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These different treatments of time over ~14 billion years, each with different emphases on historical content, are further clarified by noting that some cosmic evolutionists divide the whole narrative into three phases and seven epochs:
::'''Phases''': physical evolution → biological evolution → cultural evolution
::'''Epochs''': particulate → galactic → stellar → planetary → chemical → biological → cultural
This contrasts with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, as noted in the discussion at the end of this section below. Yet another telling of the Big-Bang-to-humankind story is one that emphasizes the earlier universe, particularly the growth of particles, galaxies, and large-scale cosmic structure, such as in [[physical cosmology]].

Notable among quantitative efforts to describe cosmic evolution are [[Eric Chaisson]]'s research efforts to describe the concept of energy flow through open, [[thermodynamic]] systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 16, p.27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_II_galley_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density. II. Probing Further a New Complexity Metric,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 17, p.44, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The observed increase of [[energy rate density]] (energy/time/mass) among a whole host of complex systems is one useful way to explain the rise of complexity in an [[expanding universe]] that still obeys the cherished [[second law of thermodynamics]] and thus continues to accumulate net [[entropy]]. As such, ordered material systems—from buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings—are viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of disorder. A recent review article, which is especially directed toward big historians, summarizes much of this empirical effort over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v. 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

One striking finding of such complexity studies is the apparently ranked order among all known material systems in the universe. Although the ''absolute'' energy in astronomical systems greatly exceeds that of humans, and although the mass densities of stars, planets, bodies, and brains are all comparable, the energy rate ''density'' for humans and modern human society are approximately a million times greater than for stars and galaxies. For example, the Sun emits a vast luminosity, 4x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (equivalent to nearly a billion billion billion watt light bulb), but it also has a huge mass, 2x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; g; thus each second an amount of energy equaling only 2 ergs passes through each gram of this star. In contrast to any star, more energy flows through each gram of a plant's leaf during photosynthesis, and much more (nearly a million times) rushes through each gram of a human brain while thinking (~20W/1350g).&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/unifying_concept_for_astrobio.pdf "A unifying concept for astrobiology,"] ''International Journal of Astrobiology'', Vol. 2, p.91, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution is more than a subjective, qualitative assertion of "one damn thing after another". This inclusive scientific worldview constitutes an objective, quantitative approach toward deciphering much of what comprises organized, material Nature. Its uniform, consistent philosophy of approach toward all complex systems demonstrates that the basic differences, both within and among many varied systems, are of degree, not of kind. And, in particular, it suggests that optimal ranges of energy rate density grant opportunities for the evolution of complexity; those systems able to adjust, adapt, or otherwise take advantage of such energy flows survive and prosper, while other systems adversely affected by too much or too little energy are non-randomly eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] in ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time: What is Complexity?'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), [[Cambridge Univ. Press]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Spier is foremost among those big historians who have found the concept of energy flows useful, suggesting that Big History is the rise and demise of complexity on all scales, from sub-microscopic particles to vast galaxy clusters, and not least many biological and cultural systems in between.&lt;ref&gt;Spier, F., ''Big History and the Future of Humanity'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian describes each stage in the progression towards greater complexity as a "threshold moment" when things become more complex, but they also become more fragile and mobile.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt; Some of Christian's threshold stages are:

[[File:SN 1997D.jpg|thumb|right|In a [[supernova]], a star which has exhausted most of its energy bursts in an incredible explosion, creating conditions for heavier elements such as [[iron]] and [[gold]] to form.]]
# The universe appears, incredibly hot, busting, expanding, within a second.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars are born.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars die, creating temperatures hot enough to make complex chemicals, as well as rocks, asteroids, planets, moons, and our solar system.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Earth is created.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Life appears on Earth, with molecules growing from the [[Goldilocks conditions]], with neither too much nor too little energy.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Humans appear, language, collective learning.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Christian elaborated that more complex systems are more fragile, and that while collective learning is a powerful force to advance humanity in general, it is not clear that humans are in charge of it, and it is possible in his view for humans to destroy the [[biosphere]] with the powerful weapons that have been invented.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

In the 2008 lecture series through ''[[The Great Courses|The Teaching Company's Great Courses]]'' entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', Christian explains Big History in terms of eight thresholds of increasing complexity:&lt;ref name=ttc&gt;{{cite book

===Goldilocks conditions===
[[File:Solar sys.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Earth]] is ideally located in a [[Goldilocks principle|Goldilocks condition]]—being neither too close nor too distant from the Sun.]]
A theme in Big History is what has been termed Goldilocks conditions or the [[Goldilocks principle]], which describes how "circumstances must be right for any type of complexity to form or continue to exist," as emphasized by Spier in his recent book.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; For humans, bodily temperatures can neither be too hot nor too cold; for life to form on a planet, it can neither have too much nor too little energy from sunlight. Stars require sufficient quantities of [[hydrogen]], sufficiently packed together under tremendous gravity, to cause [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

Christian suggests that the universe creates complexity when these Goldilocks conditions are met, that is, when things are not too hot or cold, not too fast or slow. For example, life began not in solids (molecules are stuck together, preventing the right kinds of associations) or gases (molecules move too fast to enable favorable associations) but in liquids such as water which permitted the right kinds of interactions at the right speeds.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Somewhat in contrast, [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson]] has maintained for well more than a decade that "organizational complexity is mostly governed by the ''optimum'' use of energy—not too little as to starve a system, yet not too much as to destroy it" (italics in the original published paper&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/complexity_santafe_j.pdf "Complexity: An Energetics Agenda,"] ''Complexity'', v9, p14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;). Neither maximum energy principles nor minimum entropy states are likely relevant, and appeals to "Goldilocks principles" (or other such fairy tales) are unnecessary to appreciate the emergence of complexity in Nature writ large.

===Other themes===
[[File:FISHtechniqueInt.JPG|thumb|right|Big Historians use information based on scientific techniques such as [[gene mapping]] to learn more about the origins of humanity.]]
Advances in particular sciences such as [[archaeology]], [[gene mapping]], and [[evolutionary ecology]] have enabled historians to gain new insights into the early origins of humans, despite the lack of written sources.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that proponents of Big History were trying to "upend" the conventional practice in [[historiography]] of relying on written records.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

Big History proponents suggest that humans have been affecting [[climate change]] throughout history, by such methods as [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, although past modifications have been on a lesser scale than in recent years during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

A book by Daniel Lord Smail in 2008 suggested that history was a continuing process of humans learning to self-modify our mental states by using stimulants such as [[coffee]] and [[tobacco]], as well as other means such as [[religious rite]]s or [[romance novel]]s.&lt;ref name=tws2M22&gt;{{cite news

==History of the field==

===Early efforts===
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1843]]
[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]]]]
While the emerging field of Big History in its present state is generally seen as having emerged in the past two decades beginning around 1990, there have been numerous precedents going back almost 150 years. In the mid-19th century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s book ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'', and [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers']] 1844 book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; were seen as early precursors to the field.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In a sense, Darwin's [[theory of evolution]] was, in itself, an attempt to explain a biological phenomenon by examining longer term cause-and-effect processes. In the first half of the 20th century, secular biologist [[Julian Huxley]] originated the term "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; while around the same time the French Jesuit paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] examined links between [[cosmic evolution]] and a tendency towards complexification (including human consciousness), while envisaging compatibility between cosmology, evolution, and theology. In the mid and later 20th century, ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' by [[Jacob Bronowski]] examined history from a multidisciplinary perspective. Later, [[Eric Chaisson]] explored the subject of [[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution]] quantitatively in terms of [[energy rate density]], and the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] wrote ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; [[Thomas Berry]], a cultural historian, and the academic [[Brian Swimme]] explored meaning behind myths and encouraged academics to explore themes beyond [[organized religion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|The famous ''[[Earthrise]]'' photo may have stimulated, among other things, an interest in interdisciplinary studies.]]
The field continued to evolve from interdisciplinary studies during the mid-20th century, stimulated in part by the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]]. Some early efforts were courses in ''Cosmic Evolution'' at [[Harvard University]] in the [[United States]], and ''Universal History'' in the [[Soviet Union]]. One account suggested that the notable [[Earthrise]] photo, taken during a lunar orbit by the spacecraft [[Apollo 8]], which showed Earth as a small blue and white ball behind a stark and desolate lunar landscape, not only stimulated the [[environmental movement]] but also caused an upsurge of interdisciplinary interest.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; The [[France|French]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]] examined daily life with investigations of "large-scale historical forces like geology and climate".&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; Physiologist [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' examined the interplay between geography and human evolution;&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; for example, he argued that the horizontal shape of the [[Eurasia]]n continent enabled human civilizations to advance more quickly than the vertical north-south shape of the American continent, because it enabled greater competition and information-sharing among peoples of the relatively same climate.

In the 1970s, scholars in the United States including geologist [[Preston Cloud]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], astronomer G. Siegfried Kutter at [[Evergreen State College]] in Washington state, and [[Harvard University]] astrophysicists [[George B. Field]] and [[Eric Chaisson]] started synthesizing knowledge to form a "science-based history of everything", although each of these scholars emphasized somewhat their own particular specializations in their courses and books.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1980, the Austrian philosopher [[Erich Jantsch]] wrote ''The Self-Organizing Universe'' which viewed history in terms of what he called "process structures".&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; There was an experimental course taught by John Mears at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, and more formal courses at the university level began to appear.

In 1991 [[Clive Ponting]] wrote ''A Green History of the World: The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations''. His analysis did not begin with the Big Bang, but his chapter "Foundations of History" explored the influences of large-scale geological and astronomical forces over a broad time period.

Sometimes the terms "Deep History" and "Big History" are interchangeable, but sometimes "Deep History" simply refers to history going back several hundred thousand years or more without the other senses of being a movement within history itself.&lt;ref name=tws2M25&gt;{{cite news

===David Christian===
One exponent is [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] of [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian was also affiliated with [[San Diego State University]] in [[California]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf San Diego State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209212647/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He read widely in diverse fields in science, and believed that much was missing from the general study of history. His first university-level course was offered in 1989.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; He developed a college course beginning with the [[Big Bang]] to the [[present day|present]]&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; in which he collaborated with numerous colleagues from diverse fields in science and the humanities and the social sciences. This course eventually became a [[Teaching Company]] course entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', with 24 hours of lectures,&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; which appeared in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

Since the 1990s, other universities began to offer similar courses. In 1994 at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], college courses were offered.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1996, Fred Spier wrote ''The Structure of Big History''.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; Spier looked at structured processes which he termed "regimes":

{{Quote|I defined a regime in its most general sense as 'a more or less regular but ultimately unstable pattern that has a certain temporal permanence', a definition which can be applied to human cultures, human and non-human physiology, non-human nature, as well as to organic and inorganic phenomena at all levels of complexity. By defining 'regime' in this way, human cultural regimes thus became a subcategory of regimes in general, and the approach allowed me to look systematically at interactions among different regimes which together produce big history.|Fred Spier, 2008&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;}}

Christian's course caught the attention of philanthropist [[Bill Gates]], who discussed with him how to turn Big History into a high school-level course. Gates said about David Christian:

{{Quote|He really blew me away. Here's a guy who's read across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences and brought it together in a single framework. It made me wish that I could have taken big history when I was young, because it would have given me a way to think about all of the school work and reading that followed. In particular, it really put the sciences in an interesting historical context and explained how they apply to a lot of contemporary concerns.|Bill Gates, in 2012&lt;ref name=tws2M31&gt;{{cite news

===Educational courses===
By 2002, a dozen college courses on Big History had sprung up around the world.&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; [[Cynthia Stokes Brown]] initiated Big History at the [[Dominican University of California]], and she wrote ''Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/dominican-professor-examines-big-history.html |title=Dominican Professor Examines Big History |publisher=Dominican University of California |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Dominican University of California launched the world's first Big History program to be required of all first-year students, as part of the school's general education track. This program, directed by Mojgan Behmand, includes a one-semester survey of Big History, and an interdisciplinary second-semester course exploring the Big History metanarrative through the lens of a particular discipline or subject.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/academics/advising/firstyearprograms/general-education-ge.html |title=General Education (GE) Requirements |publisher=Dominican University of California |date=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A course description reads:

The Dominican faculty's approach is to synthesize the disparate threads of Big History thought, in order to teach the content, develop critical thinking and writing skills, and prepare students to wrestle with the philosophical implications of the Big History metanarrative. In 2015, [[University of California Press]] published ''Teaching Big History'', a comprehensive pedagogical guide for teaching Big History, edited by Richard B. Simon, Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke, and written by the Dominican faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Richard B., Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke.

By 2011, 50 professors around the world have offered courses. In 2012, one report suggested that Big History was being practiced as a "coherent form of research and teaching" by hundreds of academics from different disciplines.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

There are initiatives to make Big History a required standard course for university students throughout the world. An education project founded by [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Bill Gates]] from his personal funds was launched in Australia and the United States, to offer a free online version of the course to high school students.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt;

Currently, Big History is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new views and epistemological approaches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean, whose [[decolonial]] vision of history, economics and science has opened new questions. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. This transdisciplinary vision integrates and unifies diverse [[episteme]]s that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, it includes ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach. In approaching the Big History from the [[complexity]] sciences, the transdisciplinary methodology seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos,&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bioethics as a Transdisciplinary Science of Complexity: A Co-evolutionary Introduction since the Big History |journal=Revista Colombiana de Bioética |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. The common denominator of all indigenous and aboriginal ancestral worldviews is the spiritual and ecological conception that structures their social organizations, which are in harmony and respect with the different forms of life that exist on our planet.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt; In the same way that [[Fritjof Capra]] carried out an analysis of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, the teaching of the Big History in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] is nourished by the [[worldview]] of their [[ancestor]] to analyze the parallels between the scientific discoveries and the original knowledge of the native and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9439">[[File:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|right|Biological Naturalism states that [[consciousness]] is a higher level function of the [[human brain]]'s physical capabilities.]]
'''Biological naturalism''' is a theory about, among other things, the relationship between [[consciousness]] and [[Human body|body]] (i.e. [[Human brain|brain]]), and hence an approach to the [[mind–body problem]]. It was first proposed by the philosopher [[John Searle]] in 1980 and is defined by two main theses: 1) all [[mental event|mental phenomena]] from [[Pain and nociception|pains]], tickles, and itches to the most abstruse thoughts are caused by lower-level [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] processes in the brain; and 2) mental phenomena are higher-level features of the brain.

This [[logical consequence|entails]] that the brain has the right [[causality|causal]] powers to produce [[intentionality]]. However, Searle's biological naturalism does not entail that brains and ''only'' brains can cause consciousness. Searle is careful to point out that while it appears to be the case that certain brain functions are sufficient for producing conscious states, our current state of neurobiological knowledge prevents us from concluding that they are necessary for producing consciousness. In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The fact that brain processes cause consciousness does not imply that only brains can be conscious. The brain is a [[biological machine]], and we might build an artificial machine that was conscious; just as the heart is a machine, and we have built artificial hearts. Because we do not know exactly how the brain does it we are not yet in a position to know how to do it artificially." (Biological Naturalism, 2004)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Searle (2).jpg|thumb|John Searle]]
Searle denies [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], the idea that the mind is a separate kind of substance to the body, as this contradicts our entire understanding of [[physics]], and unlike [[René Descartes|Descartes]], he does not bring [[God]] into the problem. Indeed, Searle denies any kind of dualism, the traditional alternative to monism, claiming the distinction is a mistake. He rejects the idea that because the mind is not objectively viewable, it does not fall under the rubric of physics.

Searle believes that consciousness "is a real part of the [[reality|real world]] and it cannot be [[Eliminative materialism|eliminated]] in favor of, or reduced to, something else"&lt;ref&gt; ''John R. Searle: Thinking about the Real World'' by Dirk Franken, Attila Karakus, and Jan G. Michel [http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24715-john-r-searle-thinking-about-the-real-world/]&lt;/ref&gt; whether that something else is a neurological state of the brain or a [[computer program]]. He contends, for example, that the software known as [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] ''knows'' nothing about [[chess]]. He also believes that consciousness is both a cause of events in the body and a response to events in the body.

On the other hand, Searle doesn't treat consciousness as a [[ghost in the machine]]. He treats it, rather, as a state of the brain. The causal interaction of mind and brain can be described thus in naturalistic terms: Events at the micro-level (perhaps at that of individual [[neurons]]) cause consciousness. Changes at the macro-level (the whole brain) constitute consciousness. Micro-changes cause and then are impacted by holistic changes, in much the same way that individual football players cause a team (as a whole) to win games, causing the individuals to gain confidence from the knowledge that they are part of a winning team.

He articulates this distinction by pointing out that the common philosophical term 'reducible' is ambiguous.  Searle contends that consciousness is "causally reducible" to brain processes without being "ontologically reducible".  He hopes that making this distinction will allow him to escape the traditional dilemma between [[reductive materialism]] and substance dualism; he affirms the essentially physical nature of the universe by asserting that consciousness is completely caused by and realized in the brain, but also doesn't deny what he takes to be the obvious facts that humans really are conscious, and that conscious states have an essentially first-person nature.

It can be tempting to see the theory as a kind of [[property dualism]], since, in Searle's view, a person's mental properties are categorically different from his or her micro-physical properties. The latter have "third-person [[ontology]]" whereas the former have "first-person ontology." Micro-structure is accessible objectively by any number of people, as when several brain surgeons inspect a patient's [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. But pain or desire or [[belief]] are accessible subjectively by the person who has the pain or desire or belief, and no one else has that mode of access. However, Searle holds mental properties to be a species of physical property—ones with first-person ontology. So this sets his view apart from a dualism of physical and non-physical properties. His mental properties are putatively physical.

==Criticism==
There have been several criticisms of Searle's idea of biological naturalism.

[[Jerry Fodor]] suggests that Searle gives us no account at all of exactly ''why'' he believes that  a biochemistry like, or similar to, that of the human brain is indispensable for [[intentionality]]. Fodor thinks that it seems much more plausible to suppose that it is the way in which an organism (or any other system for that matter) is connected to its environment that is indispensable in the explanation of intentionality. It is easier to see "how the fact that my thought is causally connected to a tree might bear on its being a thought about a tree. But it's hard to imagine how the fact that (to put it crudely) my thought is made out of hydrocarbons could matter, except on the unlikely hypothesis that only hydrocarbons can be causally connected to trees in the way that brains are." &lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry. (1980) "Searle On What Only Brains Can Do". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. vol. 3. pp.&amp;nbsp;217–219&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Haugeland]] takes on the central notion of some set of special "right causal powers" that Searle attributes to the biochemistry of the human brain. He asks us to imagine a concrete situation in which the "right" causal powers are those that our neurons have to reciprocally stimulate one another. In this case, silicon-based alien life forms can be intelligent just in case they have these "right" causal powers; i.e. they possess neurons with synaptics connections that have the power to reciprocally stimulate each other. Then we can take any speaker of the Chinese language and cover his neurons in some sort of wrapper which prevents them from being influenced by neurotransmitters and, hence, from having the right causal powers. At this point, "Searle's demon" (an English speaking nanobot, perhaps) sees what is happening and intervenes: he sees through the covering and determines which neurons would have been stimulated and which not and proceeds to stimulate the appropriate neurons and shut down the others himself. The experimental subject's behavior is unaffected. He continues to speak perfect Chinese as before the operation but now the causal powers of his neurotransmitters have been replaced by someone who does not understand the Chinese language. The point is generalizable: for any causal powers, it will always be possible to hypothetically replace them with some sort of Searlian demon which will carry out the operations mechanically. His conclusion is that Searle's is necessarily a dualistic view of the nature of causal powers, "not intrinsically connected with the actual powers of physical objects." &lt;ref&gt;Haugeland, John. (1980) "Artificial Intelligence". ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''. vol. 3. pp.&amp;nbsp;219–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle himself actually does not rule out the possibility for alternate arrangements of matter bringing forth consciousness other than biological brains. He also disputes that Biological naturalism is dualistic in nature in a brief essay entitled ''"Why I Am Not a Property Dualist"''.

In [[quantum field theory]], the '''Casimir effect''' and the '''Casimir–Polder force''' are physical [[force (physics)|forces]] arising from a [[quantization (physics)|quantized field]]. They are named after the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Casimir]] who predicted them in 1948.

The Casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of conducting metals and [[dielectric]]s alters the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy of the second quantized [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;E. L. Losada" [http://particulas.cnea.gov.ar/workshops/silafae/data/226.pdf Functional Approach to the Fermionic Casimir Effect] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531174312/http://particulas.cnea.gov.ar/workshops/silafae/data/226.pdf |date=31 May 2011 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohideen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Advances in the Casimir effect |author1=Michael Bordag |author2=Galina Leonidovna Klimchitskaya |author3=Umar Mohideen |chapter=Chapter I; §3: Field quantization and vacuum energy in the presence of boundaries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqE1f_s5PgYC&amp;pg=PA33 |pages=33 ''ff'' |isbn=0-19-923874-X |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics, the Casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.

Any medium supporting oscillations has an analogue of the Casimir effect. For example, beads on a string&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=D.

In modern [[theoretical physics]], the Casimir effect plays an important role in the [[nucleon#Models|chiral bag model]] of the [[nucleon]]; in [[applied physics]], it is significant in some aspects of emerging [[microtechnologies]] and [[nanotechnologies]].&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Lambrecht, Serge Reynaud and Cyriaque Genet (2007) "[http://www.fisica.unipa.it/~cewqo2007/Archive/presentations/Genet.pdf Casimir In The Nanoworld]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122143950/http://www.fisica.unipa.it/~cewqo2007/Archive/presentations/Genet.pdf |date=22 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical properties ==
The typical example is of the two [[electric charge|uncharged]] conductive plates in a [[vacuum]], placed a few nanometers apart. In a [[classical electromagnetism|classical]] description, the lack of an external field means that there is no field between the plates, and no force would be measured between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Genet|first1=C.|last2=Intravaia|first2=F.|last3=Lambrecht|first3=A.|last4=Reynaud|first4=S.|date=2004|title=Electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, Casimir and Van der Waals forces|url=http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-291/aflb291p227.pdf|journal=[[Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie]]|volume=29|issue=1–2|pages=311–328|arxiv=quant-ph/0302072|bibcode=2003quant.ph..2072G}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this field is instead studied using the [[QED vacuum|quantum electrodynamic vacuum]], it is seen that the plates do affect the [[virtual particle|virtual photons]] which constitute the field, and generate a net force&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.aps.org/story/v2/st28 The Force of Empty Space], ''[[Physical Review Focus]]'', 3 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the specific arrangement of the two plates. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of [[virtual particle]]s interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the [[zero-point energy]] of a [[Quantum field theory|quantized field]] in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured and is a striking example of an effect captured formally by [[second quantization]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lambrecht, [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/9747 The Casimir effect: a force from nothing], ''[[Physics World]]'', September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/pnu/1996/split/pnu300-3.htm American Institute of Physics News Note 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of boundary conditions in these calculations has led to some controversy. In fact, "Casimir's original goal was to compute the [[van der Waals force]] between [[dipolar polarization|polarizable molecules]]" of the conductive plates. Thus it can be interpreted without any reference to the zero-point energy (vacuum energy) of quantum fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaffe|first1=R.|year=2005|title=Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=72|issue=2|pages=021301|arxiv=hep-th/0503158|bibcode=2005PhRvD..72b1301J|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is measurable only when the distance between the objects is extremely small. On a submicron scale, this force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors. In fact, at separations of 10&amp;nbsp;nm &amp;ndash; about 100&amp;nbsp;times the typical size of an atom &amp;ndash; the Casimir effect produces the equivalent of about 1&amp;nbsp;[[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere of pressure]] (the precise value depending on surface geometry and other factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/9747|title=The Casimir effect: a force from nothing|date=1 September 2002|work=[[Physics World]]|accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicists Hendrik Casimir and [[Dirk Polder]] at [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips Research Labs]] proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947; this special form is called the '''Casimir–Polder force'''. After a conversation with [[Niels Bohr]], who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948 which is called the '''Casimir effect''' in the narrow sense.

Predictions of the force were later extended to finite-conductivity metals and dielectrics, and recent calculations have considered more general geometries. Experiments before 1997 had observed the force qualitatively, and indirect validation of the predicted Casimir energy had been made by measuring the thickness of [[liquid helium]] films. However it was not until 1997 that a direct experiment by S. Lamoreaux quantitatively measured the force to within 5% of the value predicted by the theory.&lt;ref name=Lamoureaux1997 /&gt; Subsequent experiments approach an accuracy of a few percent.

==Possible causes==
===Vacuum energy===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Faster-than-light]] --&gt;
{{Quantum field theory}}
{{Main article|Vacuum energy}}
The causes of the Casimir effect are described by [[quantum field theory]], which states that all of the various fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]], must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a simplified view, a "field" in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate [[wave equation]] for the particular field in question. The [[second quantization]] of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. At the most basic level, the field at each point in space is a [[Harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]], and its quantization places a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the [[elementary particle]]s of [[particle physics]]. However, even the [[vacuum]] has a vastly complex structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: [[spin (physics)|spin]]{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] in the case of [[light]], [[energy]], and so on. On average, most of these properties cancel out: the vacuum is, after all, "empty" in this sense. One important exception is the [[vacuum energy]] or the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or [[zero-point energy]] that such an oscillator may have is

:&lt;math&gt;{E}=\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} \hbar \omega \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. Since only ''differences'' in energy are physically measurable (with the notable exception of gravitation, which remains [[Quantum gravity#Nonrenormalizability of gravity|beyond the scope of quantum field theory]]), this infinity may be considered a feature of the mathematics rather than of the physics. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of [[renormalization]]. Dealing with infinite quantities in this way was a [[Renormalization#Attitudes and interpretation|cause of widespread unease among quantum field theorists]] before the development in the 1970s of the [[renormalization group]], a mathematical formalism for scale transformations that provides a natural basis for the process.

When the scope of the physics is widened to include gravity, the interpretation of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently [[Cosmological constant problem|no compelling explanation]] as to why it should not result in a [[cosmological constant]] that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed.&lt;ref name=Rugh&gt;

The Casimir effect for [[fermion]]s can be understood as the [[spectral asymmetry]] of the [[(−1)F|fermion operator]] &lt;math&gt;(-1)^F&lt;/math&gt;, where it is known as the [[Witten index]].

===Relativistic van der Waals force===
Alternatively, a 2005 paper by [[Robert Jaffe]] of MIT states that "Casimir effects
can be formulated and Casimir forces can be computed without reference to zero-point energies. They are relativistic, quantum forces between charges and currents. The Casimir force (per unit
area) between parallel plates vanishes as alpha, the fine structure constant, goes to zero, and the standard result, which appears to be independent of alpha, corresponds to the alpha approaching infinity limit," and that "The Casimir force is simply the (relativistic, [[retarded potential|retarded]]) [[van der Waals force]] between the metal plates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Casimir Effect and the Quantum Vacuum |author=R.L.Jaffe |year=2005 |arxiv=hep-th/0503158v1 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301 |volume=72 |journal=Physical Review D |bibcode=2005PhRvD..72b1301J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casimir and Polder's original paper used this method to derive the Casimir-Polder force. In 1978, Schwinger, DeRadd, and Milton published a similar derivation for the Casimir Effect between two parallel plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwinger | first1 = Julian | last2 = DeRaad | first2 = Lester L. | last3 = Milton | first3 = Kimball A. | year = 1978 | title = Casimir effect in dielectrics | url = | journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1016/0003-4916(78)90172-0|bibcode = 1978AnPhy.115....1S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the description in terms of van der Waals forces is the only correct description from the fundamental microscopic perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolić|first=Hrvoje|date=2016-10-10|title=Proof that Casimir force does not originate from vacuum energy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269316304567|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=761|pages=197–202|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.08.036|bibcode=2016PhLB..761..197N|arxiv = 1605.04143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolić|first=Hrvoje|date=August 2017|title=Is zero-point energy physical?

==Effects==
Casimir's observation was that the [[Canonical quantization|second-quantized]] quantum electromagnetic field, in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or [[dielectric]]s, must obey the same [[Boundary value problem|boundary condition]]s that the classical electromagnetic field must obey. In particular, this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] or dielectric.

Consider, for example, the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity, such as, for example, a [[Cavity magnetron|radar cavity]] or a [[microwave]] [[waveguide]]. In this case, the correct way to find the zero-point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the [[standing wave]]s of the cavity. To each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy; say the energy of the ''n''th standing wave is &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;. The vacuum expectation value of the energy of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n E_n&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum running over all possible values of ''n'' enumerating the standing waves. The factor of 1/2 is present because the zero-point energy of the n'th mode is &lt;math&gt;E_n/2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is the energy increment for the n'th mode. (It is the same 1/2 as appears in the equation &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar \omega/2&lt;/math&gt;.) Written in this way, this sum is clearly divergent; however, it can be used to create finite expressions.

In particular, one may ask how the zero-point energy depends on the shape ''s'' of the cavity. Each energy level &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; depends on the shape, and so one should write &lt;math&gt;E_n(s)&lt;/math&gt; for the energy level, and &lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for the vacuum expectation value. At this point comes an important observation: the force at point ''p'' on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape ''s'' of the wall is perturbed a little bit, say by &lt;math&gt;\delta s&lt;/math&gt;, at point ''p''. That is, one has

:&lt;math&gt;F(p)=- \left. \frac{\delta \langle E(s) \rangle} {\delta s} \right\vert_p.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This value is finite in many practical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief summary, see the introduction in {{cite journal |last1=Passante |first1=R. |last2=Spagnolo |first2=S. |title=Casimir-Polder interatomic potential between two atoms at finite temperature and in the presence of boundary conditions |arxiv=0708.2240 |journal=Physical Review A |volume=76 |pages=042112 |year=2007 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042112 |issue=4 |bibcode=2007PhRvA..76d2112P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attraction between the plates can be easily understood by focusing on the one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance ''a'' from one of two widely separated plates (distance ''L'' apart). With ''a'' &lt;&lt; ''L'', the states within the slot of width ''a'' are highly constrained so that the energy ''E'' of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region ''L'', where there is a large number (numbering about ''L'' / ''a'') of states with energy evenly spaced between ''E'' and the next mode in the narrow slot &amp;ndash; in other words, all slightly larger than ''E''. Now on shortening ''a'' by d''a'' (&lt; 0), the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to &amp;minus;d''a''/''a'', whereas all the ''L'' /''a'' states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to d''a''/''L'' (note the denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the ''L''/''a'' modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode in the slot. Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make ''a'' slightly smaller, the plates attracting each other across the thin slot.

==Derivation of Casimir effect assuming zeta-regularization==
* ''See '''[[v:Quantum mechanics/Casimir effect in one dimension|Wikiversity]]''' for an elementary calculation in one dimension.''

In the original calculation done by Casimir, he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates at distance &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; apart. In this case, the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate, because the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor. Assuming the plates lie parallel to the ''xy''-plane, the standing waves are

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,y,z;t)=e^{-i\omega_nt} e^{ik_xx+ik_yy} \sin(k_n z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field, and, for brevity, the polarization and the magnetic components are ignored here. Here, &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_y&lt;/math&gt; are the [[wave number]]s in directions parallel to the plates, and

:&lt;math&gt;k_n=\frac{n\pi}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

is the wave-number perpendicular to the plates. Here, ''n'' is an integer, resulting from the requirement that ψ vanish on the metal plates. The frequency of this wave is

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_n=c \sqrt{{k_x}^2 + {k_y}^2 + \frac{n^2\pi^2}{a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes. Since the area of the plates is large, we may sum by integrating over two of the dimensions in ''k''-space. The assumption of [[Van Hove singularity#Theory|periodic boundary conditions]] yields,

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle=\frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot 2
\int \frac{A dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area of the metal plates, and a factor of 2 is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave. This expression is clearly infinite, and to proceed with the calculation, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] (discussed in greater detail below). The regulator will serve to make the expression finite, and in the end will be removed. The [[Zeta function regularization|zeta-regulated]] version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=\hbar
\int \frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n
\vert \omega_n\vert^{-s}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the end, the limit &lt;math&gt;s\to 0&lt;/math&gt; is to be taken. Here ''s'' is just a [[complex number]], not to be confused with the shape discussed previously. This integral/sum is finite for ''s'' [[real number|real]] and larger than 3. The sum has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at ''s''=3, but may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] to ''s''=0, where the expression is finite. The above expression simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
\frac{\hbar c^{1-s}}{4\pi^2} \sum_n \int_0^\infty 2\pi qdq
\left \vert q^2 + \frac{\pi^2 n^2}{a^2} \right\vert^{(1-s)/2},&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;q^2=k_x^2+k_y^2&lt;/math&gt; were introduced to turn the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] into a single integral. The &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; in front is the Jacobian, and the &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; comes from the angular integration. The integral converges if Re[''s''] &gt; 3, resulting in

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
-\frac {\hbar c^{1-s} \pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}} \frac{1}{3-s}
\sum_n \vert n\vert ^{3-s}=
-\frac {\hbar c^{1-s} \pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}}\sum_n \frac{1}{\left| n\right| ^{s-3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum diverges at ''s'' in the neighborhood of zero, but if the damping of large-frequency excitations corresponding to analytic continuation of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to ''s''=0 is assumed to make sense physically in some way, then one has

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A}=
\lim_{s\to 0} \frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
-\frac {\hbar c \pi^{2}}{6a^{3}} \zeta (-3).&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(-3)=\frac {1} {120}&lt;/math&gt;

and so one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A}=
\frac {-\hbar c \pi^{2}}{720 a^{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The analytic continuation has evidently lost an additive positive infinity, somehow exactly accounting for the zero-point energy (not included above) outside the slot between the plates, but which changes upon plate movement within a closed system. The Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; for idealized, perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is

:&lt;math&gt;{F_c \over A}=-\frac{d}{da} \frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} = -\frac {\hbar c \pi^2} {240 a^4}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; (hbar, ħ) is the [[reduced Planck constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]],
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[distance]] between the two plates

The force is negative, indicating that the force is attractive: by moving the two plates closer together, the energy is lowered. The presence of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; shows that the Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; is very small, and that furthermore, the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin.

NOTE: In Casimir's original derivation [http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00018547.pdf], a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance ''a'' from one of two widely separated plates (distance ''L'' apart). The 0-point energy on ''both'' sides of the plate is considered. Instead of the above ''ad hoc'' analytic continuation assumption, non-convergent sums and integrals are computed using [[Euler–Maclaurin summation]] with a regularizing function (e.g., exponential regularization) not so anomalous as &lt;math&gt;\vert\omega_n\vert^{-s}&lt;/math&gt; in the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruggiero |first1=Zimerman |last2=Villani |title=Application of Analytic Regularization to the Casimir Forces |journal=Revista Brasileira de Física |volume=7 |number=3 |year=1977 |url=http://www.sbfisica.org.br/bjp/download/v07/v07a43.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More recent theory===
Casimir's analysis of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I E |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E M |last3=Pitaevskii |first3=Lev P |title=GENERAL THEORY OF VAN DER WAALS' FORCES |journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi |volume=4 |pages=153 |year=1961 |doi=10.1070/PU1961v004n02ABEH003330 |issue=2 |bibcode=1961SvPhU...4..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I E |last2=Kats |first2=E I |title=Casimir forces in modulated systems |arxiv=cond-mat/0408348 |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |volume=16 |pages=5659 |year=2004 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/16/32/003 |issue=32 |bibcode=2004JPCM...16.5659D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this approach, complications of the bounding surfaces, such as the modifications to the Casimir force due to finite conductivity, can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials. Lifshitz's theory for two metal plates reduces to Casimir's idealized 1/''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; force law for large separations ''a'' much greater than the [[skin depth]] of the metal, and conversely reduces to the 1/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; force law of the [[London dispersion force]] (with a coefficient called a [[Hamaker constant]]) for small ''a'', with a more complicated dependence on ''a'' for intermediate separations determined by the [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of the materials.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Parsegian, ''Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifshitz' result was subsequently generalized to arbitrary multilayer planar geometries as well as to anisotropic and magnetic materials, but for several decades the calculation of Casimir forces for non-planar geometries remained limited to a few idealized cases admitting analytical solutions.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review/&gt; For example, the force in the experimental sphere–plate geometry was computed with an approximation (due to Derjaguin) that the sphere radius ''R'' is much larger than the separation ''a'', in which case the nearby surfaces are nearly parallel and the parallel-plate result can be adapted to obtain an approximate ''R''/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; force (neglecting both skin-depth and [[Orders of approximation|higher-order]] curvature effects).&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. V. Derjaguin, I. I. Abrikosova, and E. M. Lifshitz, ''Quarterly Reviews, Chemical Society'', vol. 10, 295–329 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 2000s a number of authors developed and demonstrated a variety of numerical techniques, in many cases adapted from classical [[computational electromagnetics]], that are capable of accurately calculating Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries and materials, from simple finite-size effects of finite plates to more complicated phenomena arising for patterned surfaces or objects of various shapes.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

==Measurement==
{{refimprove science |section |date=July 2015}}
One of the first experimental tests was conducted by Marcus Sparnaay at Philips in [[w:Eindhoven|Eindhoven]] (Netherlands), in 1958, in a delicate and difficult experiment with parallel plates, obtaining results not in contradiction with the Casimir theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sparnaay |first1=M. J. |title=Attractive Forces between Flat Plates |journal=Nature |volume=180 |pages=334 |year=1957 |doi=10.1038/180334b0 |issue=4581 |bibcode=1957Natur.180..334S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sparnaay |first1=M |title=Measurements of attractive forces between flat plates |journal=Physica |volume=24 |pages=751 |year=1958 |doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(58)80090-7 |issue=6–10 |bibcode=1958Phy....24..751S }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with large experimental errors. Some of the experimental details as well as some background information on how Casimir, Polder and Sparnaay arrived at this point&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draschan.com/gallery/casimir-sparnaay-werner.mov Movie]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are highlighted in a 2007 interview with Marcus Sparnaay.

The Casimir effect was measured more accurately in 1997 by Steve K. Lamoreaux of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]],&lt;ref name=Lamoureaux1997&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamoreaux |first1=S. K. |title=Demonstration of the Casimir Force in the 0.6 to 6 μm Range |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=78 |pages=5 |year=1997 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5 |bibcode=1997PhRvL..78....5L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Umar Mohideen and Anushree Roy of the [[University of California, Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.4549 |last1=Mohideen |first1=U. |year=1998 |pages=4549 |volume=81 |journal=Physical Review Letters |last2=Roy |first2=Anushree |title=Precision Measurement of the Casimir Force from 0.1 to 0.9 µm |issue=21 |arxiv=physics/9805038 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.4549M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, rather than using two parallel plates, which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel, the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that is a part of a [[sphere]] with a large [[radius]].

In 2001, a group (Giacomo Bressi, Gianni Carugno, Roberto Onofrio and Giuseppe Ruoso) at the [[University of Padua|University of Padua (Italy)]] finally succeeded in measuring the Casimir force between parallel plates using [[Microelectromechanical system oscillator#Resonators|microresonators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bressi |first1=G. |last2=Carugno |first2=G. |last3=Onofrio |first3=R. |last4=Ruoso |first4=G. |title=Measurement of the Casimir Force between Parallel Metallic Surfaces |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=88 |pages=041804 |year=2002 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.041804 |issue=4 |pmid=11801108 |arxiv=quant-ph/0203002 |bibcode=2002PhRvL..88d1804B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regularisation==
In order to be able to perform calculations in the general case, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] in the summations. This is an artificial device, used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated, followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator.

The [[heat kernel regularization|heat kernel]] or [[Exponential function|exponentially]] regulated sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n |
\exp (-t |\omega_n |)&lt;/math&gt;

where the limit &lt;math&gt;t\to 0^+&lt;/math&gt; is taken in the end. The divergence of the sum is typically manifested as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{C}{t^3} + \textrm{finite}\,&lt;/math&gt;

for three-dimensional cavities. The infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant ''C'' which ''does not'' depend on the shape of the cavity. The interesting part of the sum is the finite part, which is shape-dependent. The [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] regulator

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n |
\exp (-t^2 |\omega_n |^2)&lt;/math&gt;

is better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties, but is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations. Other, suitably smooth, regulators may be used as well. The [[zeta function regulator]]

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n | |\omega_n |^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

is completely unsuited for numerical calculations, but is quite useful in theoretical calculations. In particular, divergences show up as poles in the [[complex plane|complex ''s'' plane]], with the bulk divergence at ''s''=4. This sum may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] past this pole, to obtain a finite part at ''s''=0.

Not every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part (the lack of a pole at ''s''=0) or shape-independent infinite parts. In this case, it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account. In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the [[plasma frequency]]), metals become transparent to [[photon]]s (such as [[X-ray]]s), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator. There are a variety of bulk effects in [[solid state physics]], mathematically very similar to the Casimir effect, where the [[cutoff frequency]] comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite. (These are discussed in greater detail in ''Landau and Lifshitz'', "Theory of Continuous Media".)

==Generalities==
The Casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of [[functional integral]]s of quantum field theory, although such calculations are considerably more abstract, and thus difficult to comprehend. In addition, they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries. However, the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called "[[virtual particle]]s".

More interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the [[eigenvalue]]s of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the [[van der Waals force]], to be understood as a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.

In the [[chiral bag model]] of the nucleon, the Casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the [[spectral asymmetry]] is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the [[baryon number]], cancelling the [[topological winding number]] of the [[pion]] field surrounding the nucleon.

==Dynamical Casimir effect==
The dynamical Casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated ''moving mirror''. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to [[quantum mechanics]] equations made in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fulling |first1=S. A. |last2=Davies |first2=P. C. W. |title=Radiation from a Moving Mirror in Two Dimensional Space-Time: Conformal Anomaly |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=348 |pages=393 |year=1976 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1976.0045 |issue=1654 |bibcode=1976RSPSA.348..393F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 an announcement was made by researchers at the [[Chalmers University of Technology]], in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified [[SQUID]] to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required [[Speed of light|relativistic]] velocity. If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26813/ |title=First Observation of the Dynamical Casimir Effect |publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogies===
A similar analysis can be used to explain [[Hawking radiation]] that causes the slow "[[Hawking radiation#Black hole evaporation|evaporation]]" of [[black hole]]s (although this is generally visualized as the escape of one particle from a [[virtual particle]]-[[antiparticle]] pair, the other particle having been captured by the black hole).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sundermier|first1=Ali|title=Evidence of Stephen Hawking's famous prediction about black holes was just observed for the first time|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-hawkings-prediction-about-black-holes-was-just-observed-for-the-first-time-2016-8|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=Business Insider|date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed within the framework of [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime]], the dynamical Casimir effect has been used to better understand acceleration radiation such as the [[Unruh effect]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Repulsive forces==
There are few instances wherein the Casimir effect can give rise to repulsive forces between uncharged objects. [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), repulsive forces can arise.&lt;ref name=DLP&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I.E. |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E.M. |last3=Pitaevskii |first3=L.P. |title=The general theory of van der Waals forces† |journal=Advances in Physics |volume=10 |pages=165 |year=1961 |doi=10.1080/00018736100101281 |issue=38 |bibcode=1961AdPhy..10..165D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has sparked interest in applications of the Casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz was carried out by Munday et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Munday |first1=J.N. |last2=Capasso |first2=F. |last3=Parsegian |first3=V.A. |title=Measured long-range repulsive Casimir-Lifshitz forces |journal=Nature |volume=457 |pages=170–3 |year=2009 |doi=10.1038/nature07610 |pmid=19129843 |issue=7226 |bibcode=2009Natur.457..170M |pmc=4169270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have also suggested the use of [[gain media]] to achieve a similar levitation effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1559579/Physicists-have-%27solved%27-mystery-of-levitation.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Physicists have 'solved' mystery of levitation |first=Roger |last=Highfield |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium ([[Kramers–Kronig relations]]). Casimir and Casimir-Polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies; for a review of the issues involved with repulsion see Milton et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milton |first1=K.

'''Cavitation''' is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid, small liquid-free zones ("bubbles" or "voids"), that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of [[pressure]] that cause the formation of cavities in the liquid where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense [[shock wave]].

Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some [[engineering]] contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called "cavitation". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.

Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]]. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.

Since the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].

== Physics ==

Inertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.

Other ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233–252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.

The physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation "bubbles" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.

The vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.

==Hydrodynamic cavitation==
Hydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.

The process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Orifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChe Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641–1648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes. These processes are manifested in different ways, the most common ones and promising for control being bubble cavitation and supercavitation. The first exact classical solution should perhaps be credited to the well- known solution by H. Helmholtz in 1868. The earliest distinguished studies of academic type on the theory of a cavitating flow with free boundaries and supercavitation were published in the book ''Jets, wakes and cavities''&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff, G, Zarantonello. E (1957) Jets, wakes and cavities. New York: Academic Press.  406p.&lt;/ref&gt;  followed by ''Theory of jets of ideal fluid''.&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich, MI (1978) Theory of jets of ideal fluid.  Nauka, Moscow, 536p. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Widely used in these books was the well-developed theory of conformal mappings of functions of a complex variable, allowing one to derive a large number of exact solutions of plane problems. Another venue combining the existing exact solutions with approximated and heuristic models was explored in the work ''Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries''&lt;ref&gt;Logvinovich, GV (1969) Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries. Naukova dumka, Kiev, 215p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  that refined the applied calculation techniques based on the principle of cavity expansion independence, theory of pulsations and stability of elongated axisymmetric cavities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, RT, Daili, JW, Hammit, FG (1970) Cavitation. New York: Mc Graw Hill Book Company.  578p.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels''.&lt;ref&gt;Epshtein, LA (1970) Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels. Sudostroyenie , Leningrad, 208p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

A natural continuation of these studies was recently presented in ''The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows''&lt;ref&gt;Terentiev, A, Kirschner, I, Uhlman, J, (2011) The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows. Backbone Publishing Company, 598pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  – an encyclopedic work encompassing all the best advances in this domain for the last three decades, and blending the classical methods of mathematical research with the modern capabilities of computer technologies. These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P. R. |last2=Kabadi |first2=A.

==Applications==

===Chemical engineering===
In industry, cavitation is often used to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenize]], or mix and break down, suspended particles in a [[colloidal]] liquid compound such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).

Cavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].

Use of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. --&gt;

Hydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together.

Ultrasound sometimes is used to increase bone formation, for instance in post-surgical applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physiomontreal.com/Ultrasound.pdf PhysioMontreal Article "Ultrasound".]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultrasound treatments or exposure can create cavitation that potentially may "result in a syndrome involving manifestations of nausea, headache, tinnitus, pain, dizziness, and fatigue.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php Health Canada "Guidelines for the Safe Use of Ultrasound: Part II – Industrial &amp; Commercial Applications – Safety Code 24"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110213842/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php |date=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the sound of [[cracking joints|"cracking" knuckles]] derives from the collapse of cavitation in the synovial fluid within the joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=A|author2=Dowson, D|author3=Wright, V|title='Cracking joints'. A bioengineering study of cavitation in the metacarpophalangeal joint|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|date=July 1971|volume=30|issue=4|pages=348–58|pmid=5557778|doi=10.1136/ard.30.4.348|pmc=1005793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Movements that cause cracking expand the joint space, thus reducing pressure to the point of cavitation. It remains controversial whether this is associated with clinically significant joint injury such as osteoarthritis. Some physicians say that osteoarthritis is caused by cracking knuckles regularly, as this causes wear and tear and may cause the bone to weaken. The implication being that, it is not the "bubbles popping," but rather, the bones rubbing together, that causes osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deweber|first=K|author2=Olszewski, M|author3=Ortolano, R|title=Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM|date=Mar–Apr 2011|volume=24|issue=2|pages=169–74|pmid=21383216|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
In industrial cleaning applications, cavitation has sufficient power to overcome the particle-to-substrate adhesion forces, loosening contaminants. The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input. This method works by generating controlled acoustic cavitation in the cleaning fluid, picking up and carrying contaminant particles away so that they do not reattach to the material being cleaned.

=== Food and beverage ===

==== Eggs ====
Cavitation has been applied to egg pasteurization. A hole-filled rotor produces cavitation bubbles, heating the liquid from within. Equipment surfaces stay cooler than the passing liquid, so eggs don't harden as they did on the hot surfaces of older equipment. The intensity of cavitation can be adjusted, making it possible to tune the process for minimum protein damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/12/11/569467444/how-the-food-industry-uses-cavitation-the-oceans-most-powerful-punch|title=How The Food Industry Uses Cavitation, The Ocean's Most Powerful Punch|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cavitation damage{{anchor|Cavitation erosion}}==
[[Image:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cavitation damage to a [[Francis turbine]].]]

Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buckland H. C. |first2=Baker T. |last2=Orme J. A. C. |first=Masters I. |doi=10.1177/0957650913477093 |year=2013 |title=Cavitation inception and simulation in blade element momentum theory for modelling tidal stream turbines |journal=Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part A: Journal of Power and Energy |volume=227 |issue=4 |pages=479–485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].

Although the collapse of a small cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller's or pump's lifetime.

After a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevices that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumps and propellers===
Major places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.

As an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure around it can become. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.

Cavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:

====Suction cavitation====
[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.

Common causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.

====Discharge cavitation====
Discharge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.

Discharge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.

====Cavitation solutions====
Since all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.

To have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pulp &amp; Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes&lt;/ref&gt;
To overcome cavitation:
Increase suction pressure if possible.
Decrease liquid temperature if possible.
Throttle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.
Vent gases off the pump casing.

===Control valves===

Cavitation can occur in [[control valves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136&lt;/ref&gt;  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.

===Spillways===
When water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.

Experimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between 12 and 15&amp;nbsp;m/s, and, up to flow velocities of 20&amp;nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.&lt;ref name="Volkart_Rutschmann_1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors – A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc.

When some air is present in the water the resulting mixture is compressible and this damps the high pressure caused
by the bubble collapses.&lt;ref name="Peterka_1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peterka, A.J. |title= The Effect of Entrained Air on Cavitation Pitting."

Although these have been installed for some years, the mechanisms of air entrainment at the aerators and the slow movement of the air away from the spillway surface are still challenging.&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989a"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Study of Air Entrainment and Aeration Devices, Journal of Hydraulic Research, IAHR, Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 301–319 (ISSN 0022-1686)  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view.php?pid=UQ:9385 |year=1989 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989b"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Flow downstream of an Aerator.

The spillway aeration device design is based upon a small deflection of the spillway bed (or sidewall) such as a ramp and offset to deflect the high flow velocity flow away from the spillway surface. In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.

===Engines===
Some larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.

It is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.

From about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.

===Geology===
Some hypotheses relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation—namely cavitiation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.

The loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat. Rising magma, filled with dissolved gasses and under immense pressure, encountered a different magma that compressed easily, allowing bubbles to grow and combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/hvo_volcano_watch.html|title=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory|last=Program|first=Volcano Hazards|website=volcanoes.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation, which is well known from the technical practice.

===Vascular plants===
Cavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem exceeds [[atmospheric pressure]]. The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., &amp; Tyree, M.T., 1996. New evidence for large negative xylem pressures and their measurement by the pressure chamber technique. 'Plant Cell Environ.' 19: 427–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine life===
Just as cavitation bubbles form on a fast-spinning boat propeller, they may also form on the tails and fins of aquatic animals. This primarily occurs near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is low.

Cavitation may limit the maximum swimming speed of powerful swimming animals like [[dolphins]] and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brahic | first = Catherine | title = Dolphins swim so fast it hurts   | publisher = New Scientist | date = 2008-03-28 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn13553-dolphins-swim-so-fast-it-hurts.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are painful. Tuna have bony fins without nerve endings and do not feel pain from cavitation. They are slowed down when cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.&lt;ref name="IosilevskiiWeihs2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iosilevskii|first1=G|last2=Weihs|first2=D|title=Speed limits on swimming of fishes and cetaceans|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=20|year=2008|pages=329–338|issn=1742-5689|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1073|pmid=17580289|pmc=2607394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea animals have found ways to use cavitation to their advantage when hunting prey. The [[pistol shrimp]] snaps a specialized claw to create cavitation, which can kill small fish. The [[mantis shrimp]] (of the ''smasher'' variety) uses cavitation as well in order to stun, smash open, or kill the shellfish that it feasts upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patek|first=Sheila|title=Sheila Patek clocks the fastest animals|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sheila_patek_clocks_the_fastest_animals.html|publisher=TED|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coastal erosion===
In the last half-decade, coastal erosion in the form of inertial cavitation has been generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Geomorphology |last=Panizza |first=Mario  |year=1996 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam; New York |isbn=978-0-444-89830-2 |pages=112–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bubbles in an incoming wave are forced into cracks in the cliff being eroded. Varying pressure decompresses some vapor pockets which subsequently implode. The resulting pressure peaks can blast apart fractions of the rock.

'''Certified wood''' and paper products come from responsibly managed forests – as defined by a particular standard. With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore Forest Certification Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
'''Forest certification''' programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include:

Basic requirements of credible forest certification programs include:
* Protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration (e.g., replanting and reforestation).
* Third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies.
* Publicly available certification audit summaries.
* Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards development process.
* Complaints and appeals process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf National Association of State Foresters Policy Statement 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Today there are more than 50 certification programs worldwide &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Sustainable_Forests/Third_Party_Forest_Certification.pdf Third-Party Forest Certification in British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) and the [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC).

The PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 115] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between [[Environmental organizations|environmental]] [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]], forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including [[Jared Diamond]], have suggested that many competing standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== United States and Canada ===

In the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the [[American Tree Farm System]] (ATFS), the [[Canadian Standards Association]]’s [[Sustainable Forest Management Standard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ CSA International Forest Products Marking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019030053/http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ |date=2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] (SFI) Program. ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. The FSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsccanada.org/forestmanagementstd.htm Forest Stewardship Council Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fscus.org FSC United States]&lt;/ref&gt; program is applied throughout North America. SFI is the world’s largest regional forest certification program in terms of total certified forest area[1].

The [[National Association of State Foresters]] in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports ''all'' of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: “... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability.... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‘one size fits all’ approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs.”.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf Forest Certification as it Contributes to Sustainable Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Council of Forest Ministers]] issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: “In Canada, each jurisdiction’s forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an {{sic|hide=y|over-|arching}} framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada’s forest management laws, and to document the country’s world-class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccfm.org/pdf/CCFM_Statement_FRandEN.pdf#page=2 Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Statement on Forest Certification Standards in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain-of-custody certification==

Chain of Custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process – from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests.

The United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 118] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future expansion==

Forest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world’s forest under at least one certification program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 113] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification.

Third-party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers’ market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 114] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper, publishing, printing and packaging – commitments to increase the use of responsible paper sources by large publishers such as Time Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeinc.com/community/sustainability.php Time Inc. Sustainability Report 2009-2010 page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; has probably been the most significant factor driving growth in forest and chain-of-custody certification.
* Green public procurement – governments such as the UK and the Netherlands have adopted green timber procurement policies, including recognition of FSC and PEFC endorsed programs. An example is the UK’s Central Point of Expertise on Timber (set up by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and operated by ProForest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpet.org.uk/evidence-of-compliance/category-a-evidence/introduction Central Point of Expertise on Timber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Green building – standards for green building incentivize and reward the use of certified wood products.
*Illegal logging – new legislation designed to minimize the risk of illegal wood entering supply chains such as the amended Lacey Act in the United States has created a strong incentive to demand independently certified wood that can address illegal logging concerns.

The World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/stories/2009/12/fact-sheet-are-you-ready-lacey-act World Resources Institute fact sheet Are You Ready for the Lacey Act?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.

{{main|Chirality (chemistry)}}

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

More recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moloney|first=Mícheál P.|last2=Gun'ko|first2=Yurii K.|last3=Kelly|first3=John M.|date=2007-09-26|title=Chiral highly luminescent CdS quantum dots|url=https://doi.org/10.1039/b704636g|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=0|issue=38|doi=10.1039/b704636g|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaaff|first=T.

==Biology==
{{See also|Homochirality}}

All of the known life-forms show specific chiral properties in chemical structures as well as macroscopic anatomy, development and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Wende|last2=Ernst|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Palotas|first3=Krisztian|last4=Zhang|first4=Yuyang|last5=Bruyer|first5=Emilie|last6=Peng|first6=Lingqing|last7=Greber|first7=Thomas|last8=Hofer|first8=Werner A.|last9=Scott|first9=Lawrence T.|date=2016-02-08|title=Microscopic origin of chiral shape induction in achiral crystals|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2449|journal=Nature Chemistry|language=En|volume=8|issue=4|pages=326–330|doi=10.1038/nchem.2449|issn=1755-4330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any specific organism or evolutionarily related set thereof, individual compounds, organs, or behavior are found in the same single enantiomorphic form. Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Sometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions. For example, (+)-Limonene found in orange (causing its smell), and (–)-Limonene found in Lemons (causing its smell), show different smells&lt;ref&gt;Solomon and Fryhles organic chemistry, Ed 10, Wiley (Students edition), Chapter 5 (Stereochemistry), Section 5.5 More about biological significance of chirality&lt;/ref&gt; due to different biochemical interactions at human nose.

Also, for artificial compounds, including medicines, in case of chiral drugs, the two enantiomers sometimes show remarkable difference in effect of their biological actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanganyado|first=Edmond|last2=Lu|first2=Zhijiang|last3=Fu|first3=Qiuguo|last4=Schlenk|first4=Daniel|last5=Gan|first5=Jay|date=2017|title=Chiral pharmaceuticals: A review on their environmental occurrence and fate processes|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0043135417306565|journal=Water Research|volume=124|pages=527–542|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.003|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvon ([[Dextropropoxyphene]]) is a painkiller, whereas its enantiomer, Novrad ([[Levopropoxyphene]]) is an anti-cough agent.

[[File:DirkvdM natural spiral.jpg|thumb|A natural left-handed helix, made by a certain climber plant's [[tendril]]. |171x171px]]
Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

[[File:Neptunea - links&amp;rechts gewonden.jpg|thumb|200px|Shells of two different species of sea snail: on the left is the normally sinistral (left-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea angulata]]'', on the right is the normally dextral (right-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea despecta]]'']]
In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

'''Coastal Hazards''' are physical phenomena that expose a coastal area to risk of property damage, loss of life and environmental degradation. Rapid-onset hazards last over periods of minutes to several days and examples include major cyclones accompanied by high winds, waves and surges or tsunamis created by [[submarine earthquake]]s and landslides. Slow-onset hazards develop incrementally over longer time periods and examples include erosion and gradual inundation.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2005) Encyclopaedia of Coastal Science, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Since early civilisation, coastal areas have been attractive settling grounds for human population as they provided abundant marine resources, fertile agricultural land and possibilities for trade and transport. This has led to high population densities and high levels of development in many coastal areas and this trend is continuing into the 21st century. At present, about 1,2 billion people live in coastal areas globally, and this number is  predicted to increase to 1,8–5,2 billion by the 2080s due to a combination of population growth and coastal migration.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2007: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/contents.html&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this increase follows major investments in infrastructure and the build environment.

The characteristics of coastal environments, however, pose some great challenges to human habitation. Coastlines are highly dynamic natural systems that interact with terrestrial, marine and atmospheric processes and undergo continuous change in response to these processes. Over the years, human society has often failed to recognize the hazards related to these dynamics &lt;ref&gt;Masselink &amp; Hughes, Coastal processes &amp; geomorphology, Arnold, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and this has led to major disasters and societal disruption to various degrees. Even today, coastal development is often taking place with little regard to the hazards present in these environments, although climate change is likely to increase the general hazard levels.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2014: http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/&lt;/ref&gt; Societal activities in coastal areas can also pose a hazard to the natural balance of coastal systems, thereby disrupting e.g. sensitive ecosystems and subsequently human livelihood.

Coastal hazard management has become an increasingly important aspect of coastal planning in order to improve the resilience of society to coastal hazards. Possible management options include hard engineering structures, soft protection measures, various accommodation approaches as well as a managed retreat from the coastline. For addressing coastal hazards, it is also important to have early warning systems and emergency management plans in place to be able to address sudden and potential disastrous hazards i.e. major flooding events. Events as the Hurricane Katrina affecting the southern USA in 2005 and the cyclone Nargis affecting Myanmar in 2008 provides clear examples of the importance of timely coastal hazard management.

== Coastal environments of the USA ==
There are many different types of environments along the coasts of the United States with very diverse features that affect, influence, and mold the near-shore processes that are involved.  Understanding these ecosystems and environments can further advance the mitigating techniques and policy-making efforts against natural and man-made coastal hazards in these vulnerable areas.  The five most common types of [[coastal zone]]s range from the northern ice-pushing, mountainous coastline of Alaska and Maine, the barrier island coasts facing the Atlantic, the steep, cliff-back [[Headlands and bays|headlands]] along the pacific coast, the marginal-sea type coastline of the Gulf region, and the coral reef coasts bordering Southern Florida and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, Douglas L. "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE IN THE COASTAL ZONE." Environmental Science in the Coastal Zone: Issues for Further Research. The National Academic Press. Web. 09 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice-pushing/mountainous coastline'''

These coastal regions along the northernmost part of the nation were affected predominantly by, along with the rest of the Pacific Coast, continuous tectonic activity, forming a very long, irregular, ridged, steep and mostly mountainous coastline.  These environments are heavily occupied with permafrost and glaciers, which are the two major conditions affecting Alaska's Coastal Development.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrier island coastline'''

[[Barrier island]]s are a land form system that consists of fairly narrow strips of sand running parallel to the mainland and play a significant role in mitigating storm surges and oceans swells as natural storm events occur. The morphology of the various types and sizes of barrier islands depend on the wave energy, tidal range, basement controls, and sea level trends.  The islands create multiple unique environments of wetland systems including marshes, estuaries, and lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;"BarrierIslnd." Smithsonian Marine Station (SMS) at Fort Pierce. Web. 30 April 2012. &lt;http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/BarrierIslnd.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steep, cliff-backing abrasion coastline'''

The coastline along the western part of the nation consists of very steep, cliffed rock formations generally with vegetative slopes descending down and a fringing beach below.  The various sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic rock formations assembled along a tectonically disturbed environment, all with altering resistances running perpendicular, cause the ridged, extensive stretch of uplifted cliffs that form the peninsulas, lagoons, and valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, B., and N. Sitar. "Processes of Coastal Bluff Erosion in Weakly Lithified Sands, Pacifica, California, USA." Geomorphology 97.3–4 (2008): 483–501. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marginal-sea type coastline'''

The southern banks of the United States border the Gulf of Mexico, intersecting numerous rivers, forming many inlets bays, and lagoons along its coast, consisting of vast areas of marsh and wetlands.  This region of landform is prone to natural disasters yet highly and continuously developed, with man-made structures attaining to water flow and control.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coral reef coastline'''

[[Coral reef]]s are located off the shores of the southern Florida and Hawaii consisting of rough and complex natural structures along the bottom of the ocean floor with extremely diverse ecosystems, absorbing up to ninety percent of the energy dissipated from wind-generated waves.  This process is a significant buffer for the inner-lying coastlines, naturally protecting and minimizing the impact of storm surge and direct wave damage.  Because of the highly diverse ecosystems, these coral reefs not only provide for the shoreline protection, but also deliver an abundant amount of services to fisheries and  tourism, increasing its economic value.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, John. "Coral Reefs". Nature 40.1030 (1889): 294. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Coastal Hazards ==

[[File:Hurricane Flooding.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Surge]]

'''Natural VS Human disasters'''

The population that lives along or near our coastlines are an extremely vulnerable population.  There are numerous issues facing our coastlines and there are two main categories that these hazards can be placed under, [[Natural disasters]] and Human disasters.  Both of these issues cause great damage to our coastlines and discussion is still ongoing regarding what standards or responses need to be met to help both the individuals who want to continue living along the coastline, while keeping them safe and not eroding more coastline away.  Natural disasters are disasters that are out of human control and are usually caused by the weather.  Disasters that include but are not limited to; [[storms]], [[tsunamis]], [[typhoons]], [[flooding]], [[tides]], [[waterspouts]], [[nor'easters]], and [[storm surge]].  Human disasters occur when humans are the main culprit behind why the disaster happened.  Some human disasters are but are not limited to; [[pollution]], [[trawling]], and human development. Natural and human disasters continue to harm the coastlines severely and they need to be researched in order to prepare/stop the hazards if possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Coastal hazards- natural," 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations that live near or along the coast experience many hazards and it affects millions of people.  Around ten million people globally feel the effects of coastal problems yearly and most are due to certain natural hazards like coastal flooding with storm surges and typhoons.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A major problem related to coastal regions deals with how the entire global environment is changing and in response, the coastal regions are easily affected.

[[File:Hurricane Diana.jpg|thumb|left|Hurricane Diana]]

'''Storms, Flooding and Erosion'''

Storms are one of the major hazards that are associated to coastal regions.  Storms, flooding, and erosion are closely associated and can happen simultaneously.  Tropical storms or Hurricanes especially can devastate coastal regions.  For example, Florida during [[Hurricane Andrew]] occurred in 1992 that caused extreme damage.  It was a category five hurricane that caused $26.5 billion in damages and even 23 individuals lost their lives from the storm.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurricane Katrina also caused havoc along the coast to show the extreme force a hurricane can do in a certain region.&lt;ref&gt;Burby, R. (n.d.). Hurricane katrina . Sage journals, Retrieved from http://ann.sagepub.com/content/604/1/171.short&lt;/ref&gt; The Chennai Floods of 2015, which affected many people, is an example of flooding due to cyclones. People across the whole state of Tamil Nadu felt its impact and even parts of Andhra Pradesh got affected. There was a loss of Rs.900 crore and 280 people died. Many cyclones like this happen across Asia but the media reports only minor hurricanes which hit the United States.

  In almost all cases, storms are the major culprit that causes flooding and erosion.  Flash flooding is caused by storms that occurs when a massive amount of rainfall comes down into an area over a short period of time.  Where as a storm surge, which is closely related to tropical storms, is when the wind collects and pushes water towards low pressure or inland and can rise rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;(2009).  Coastal hazards- natural disasters. Ocean science and stewardship, Retrieved from http://dels-old.nas.edu/oceans/coastal_hazards_part_2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an offshore rise of water and overall creates a higher sea level that rises and is pushed inland.  The amount of rise or fall of storm surge depends greatly on the amount and duration of wind and water in a specific location.  Also if it occurs during a high tide it can have an even greater effect on the coast.

Almost all storms with high wind and water cause erosion along the coast.  Erosion occurs when but not limited to; along shore currents, tides, sea level rise and fall, and high winds.  Larger amounts of erosion cause the coastline to erode away at a faster rate and can leave people homeless and leave less land to develop or keep for environmental reasons.  Coastal erosion has been increasing over the past few years and it is still on the rise which makes it a major coastline hazard.  In the United States, 45 percent of its coast line is along the Atlantic or Gulf coast and the erosion rate per year along the Gulf coast is at six feet a year.  The average rate of erosion along the Atlantic is around two to three feet a year.  Even with these findings, erosion rates in specific locations vary because of various environmental factors such as major storms that can cause major erosion upwards to 100 feet or more in only one day.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FEMA or Federal Emergency Management Agency. (2000). Significant losses from coastal erosion anticipated along u.s. coastlines. Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov /news/newsrelease.fema?id=7708&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pollution, Trawling and Human Development'''
[[File:Loss of Property due to storms.jpg|thumb|right|North Carolina Homes being taken by the Atlantic Ocean 08-23-2011]]
Pollution, trawling, and human development are major human disasters that affect coastal regions.  There are two main categories related to pollution, [[point source pollution]], and [[nonpoint source pollution]].  Point source pollution is when there is an exact location such as a pipeline or a body of water that leads into the rivers and oceans.  Known dumping into the ocean is also another point source of pollution.  Nonpoint source pollution would pertain more to fertilizer runoff, and industrial waste.  Examples of pollution that affect the coastal regions are but are not limited to; fertilizer runoff, oil spills, and dumping of hazardous materials into the oceans.  More human acts that hurt the coastline are as follows; waste discharge, fishing, dredging, mining, and drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, D. (n.d.). Types of coastal zones: similarities and differences. Retrieved from http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&amp;page=67&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil spills are one of the most hazardous dangers towards coastal communities.  They are hard to contain, difficult to clean up, and devastate everything.  The fish, animals such as birds, the water, and especially the coastline near the spill.  The most recent oil spill that had everybody concerned with oil spill was the [[BP oil spill]].

Trawling hurts the normal ecosystems in the water around the coastline.  It depletes all ecosystems on the ocean floor such as, flounder, shellfish, marsh etc.. It is simply a giant net that is drug across the ocean floor and destroys and catches anything in its path.  Human development is one of the major problems when facing coastal hazards.  The overall construction of buildings and houses on the coast line takes away the natural occurrences to handle the fluctuation in water and sea level rise.  Building houses in pre-flood areas or high risk areas that are extremely vulnerable to flooding are major concerns towards human development in coastal regions.  Having houses and buildings in areas that are known to have powerful storms that will create people to be in risk by living there.  Also pertaining to barrier islands, where land is at risk for erosion but they still continue to build there anyway.  More and more houses today are being taken by the ocean; look at picture above.

'''Coastal hazards &amp; climate change'''

The predicted climate change is adding an extra risk factor to human settlement in coastal areas. Whereas the natural dynamics that shape our coastlines have been relatively stable and predictable over the last centuries, much more rapid change is now expected in processes as sea level rise, ocean temperature and acidity, tropical storm intensity and precipitation/runoff patterns.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. 
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The world's coastlines will respond to these changes in different ways and at different pace depending on their bio-geophysical characteristics, but generally society will have to recognize that past coastal trends cannot be directly projected into the future. Instead, it is necessary to consider how different coastal environments will respond to the predicted climate change and take the expected future hazards into account in the coastal planning processes.

== Policies ==

'''National Flood Insurance Program'''

The National Flood Insurance Program or [[NFIP]] was instituted in 1968 and offers home owners in qualifying communities an opportunity to rebuild and recover after flooding events following the decision by insurance companies to discontinue providing flood insurance. This decision was made on behalf of the private insurers after continually high and widespread flood losses. The goals of this program are to not only better protect individuals from flood, but to reduce property losses, and reduce the total amount disbursed for flood loses by the government. Only communities which have adopted and implemented mitigation policies that are compliant with or exceed federal regulations. The regulatory policies reduce risk to life and property located within floodplains. The NFIP also comprehensively mapped domestic floodplains increasing public awareness of risk.  The majority of structures were constructed after the mapping was completed and risk could be assessed. To reduce the cost to these owners, which constitute roughly 25% of the total policies the rates for insurance are subsidized.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration. National Flood Insurance Program: Program Description. U.S. Government Press, August 1, 2002 Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1480&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal States Organization'''

The [[Coastal States Organization]] or COS was established in 1970 to represent 35 U.S. sub-federal governments on issues of coastal policies. CSO lobbies Congress on issues pertaining to Coastal Policy allowing states input on federal policy decisions. Funding, support, water quality, coastal hazards, and coastal zone management are the primary issues COS promotes. The strategic goals of COS are to provide information and assistance to members,evaluate and manage coastal needs, and secure long term funding for member states initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;About COS. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.coastalstates.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal Zone Management Act'''

In 1972 the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] or CZMA works to streamline the policies which states create to a minimum federal standard for environmental protection. CZMA establishes the national policy for the development and implementation of regulatory programs for coastal land usage, which is supposed to be reflected in state legislation such as CAMA. CZMA also provides minimum building requirements to make the insurance provided through the NFIP less expensive for the government to operate by mitigating losses. Congress found that it was necessary to establish the minimum which programs should provide for. Each coastal state is required to have a program with 7 distinct parts: Identifying land uses,Identifying critical coastal areas, Management measures,Technical assistance, Public participation, Administrative coordination, State coastal zone boundary modification.&lt;ref&gt;(1972). 16 usc chapter 33 – coastal zone management.

'''The Coastal Area Management Act'''

The Coastal Area Management Act or CAMA is policy that was implemented by the state of North Carolina in 1974 to work in-tandem with the CZMA. It creates a cooperative program between the state and local governments. The State government operates in an advisory capacity and reviews decisions made by local government planners. The goal of this legislation was to create a management system capable of preserving the coastal environment, insure the preservation of land and water resources, balance the use of coastal resources and establish guidelines and standards for conservations, economic development, tourism, transportation, and the protection of common law.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, Division of Coastal Management.

== Management and planning ==

Due to the increasing urbanization along the coastlines, planning and management are essential to protecting the ecosystems and environment from depleting. [[Coastal management]] is becoming implemented more because of the movement of people to the shore and the hazards that come with the territory. Some of the hazards include movement of [[barrier island]]s, [[sea level rise]], [[hurricane]]s, [[nor'easter]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[flooding]], [[erosion]], [[pollution]] and human development along the coast. The [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA)  was created in 1972 because of the continued growth along the coast, this act introduced better management practices such as [[integrated coastal zone management]], [[adaptive management]] and the use [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] strategies when planning. According to the Coastal Zone Management Act, the objectives are to remain balanced to "preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance the resources of the nation's coastal zone".&lt;ref&gt;National oceanic and atmospheric administration.

'''Integrated coastal zone management'''

Integrated coastal zone management means the integration of all aspects of the coastal zone; this includes environmentally, socially, culturally politically and economically to meet a sustainable balance all around. Sustainability is the goal to allow development yet protect the environment in which we develop. Coastal zones are fragile and do not do well with change so it is important to acquire sustainable development. The integration from all views will entitle a holistic view for the best implementation and management of that country, region and local scales. The five types of integration&lt;ref&gt;CICIN-SAIN, B. 1993. Sustainable Development and Integrated Coastal Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 11–43.&lt;/ref&gt; include integration among sectors, integration between land and water elements of the coastal zone, integration amount levels of government, integration between nations and integration among disciplines are all essential to meet the needs for implementation.
Management practices include
#maintaining the functional integrity of the coastal resource systems,without disrupting the environment
#reducing resource-use conflicts, by making sure resources are used adequately and sustainably,
#maintaining the health of the environment, which means to protect the ecosystems and natural cycle,
#facilitating the progress of multisectoral development, which means allowing developers to develop within standards.&lt;ref&gt;THIA-ENG, C. 1993. Essential Elements of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 81–108.&lt;/ref&gt;
These four management practices should be based on a bottom-up approach, meaning the approach starts from a local level which is more intimate to the specific environment of that area. After assessment from the local level, the state and federal input can be implemented. The bottom-up approach is key for protecting the local environments because there is a diversity of environments that have specific needs all over the world.

'''Adaptive management'''
[[File:Managing Coastal Hazards.gif|thumb|left| Managing Coastal Hazards Chart]]
Adaptive management is another practice of development adaptation with the environment. Resources are the major factor when managing  adaptively to a certain environment to accommodate all the needs of development and ecosystems. Strategies used must be flexible by either passive or active adaptive management include these key features:&lt;ref&gt;Elzinga, C.L., D. W. Salzer, J. W. Willoughby (1998). Measuring and Monitoring Plant Populations. Denver, CO: Bureau of Land Management. BLM Technical Reference 1730-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*AIterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*Feedback between monitoring and decisions (learning process)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference (experimentation)
*Embracing risk and uncertainty as a way of building understanding (trial and error)
To achieve adaptive management is testing the assumptions to achieve a desired outcome, such as trial and error, find the best known strategy then monitoring it to adapt to the environment, and learning the outcomes of success and failures of a project.

'''Mitigation'''
[[File:Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Relocation due to high energy wave activity.jpg|thumb|right|Relocation of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, NC, Failure of groin to protect the coast]]
The purpose of [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] is not only to minimize the loss of property damage, but minimize environmental damages due to development. To avoid impacts by not taking or limiting actions, to reduce or rectify impacts by rehabilitation or restoring the affected environments or instituting long-term maintenance operations and compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute environments for resources&lt;ref&gt;Race, Margret. , &amp; Christie, Donna, (n.d.). Coastal zone development: Mitigation and decision-making. 6(4), 317–328. Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/r078478127573341/fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Structural mitigation is the current solution to eroding beaches and movement of sand is the use of engineered structures along the coast have been short lived and are only an illusion of safety to the public that result in long term damage of the coastline.  Structural management deals with the use of the following: groins which are man-made solution to [[longshore drift|longshore current]] movements up and down the coast. The use of groins are efficient to some extent yet cause erosion and sand build up further down the beaches. Bulkheads are man-made structures that help protect the homes built along the coast and other bodies of water that actually induce erosion in the long run. Jetties are structures built to protect sand movement into the inlets where boats for fishing and recreation move through.
The use of nonstructural mitigation is the practice of using organic and soft structures for solutions to protect against coastal hazards. These include: artificial dunes, which are used to create dunes that have been either developed on or eroded. There needs to be at least two lines of dunes before any development can occur. Beach Nourishment is a major source of nonstructural mitigation to ensure that beaches are present for the communities and for the protection of the coastline. Vegetation is a key factor when protecting from erosion, specifically for to help stabilize dune erosion.

[[Image:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|Building a CEB project in Midland, Texas in August 2006]]
A '''compressed earth block''' ('''CEB'''), also known as a ''pressed earth block'' or a ''compressed soil block'', is a [[building material]] made primarily from damp [[soil]] compressed at high pressure to form blocks. Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press to form blocks out of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic [[subsoil]], non-expansive [[clay]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as [[Portland cement]] they are called ''compressed stabilized earth block'' (CSEB) or ''stabilized earth block'' (SEB). Typically, around {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.

Creating CEBs differs from [[rammed earth]] in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from [[mud brick]]s in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB can meet or exceed that of typical cement or mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB.

CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard [[bricklaying]] and [[masonry]] techniques. The [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may be a simple [[slurry]] made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues. [[Hydraform block]]s are shaped to be interlocking.

==Development==
CEB technology has been developed  for low-cost construction, as an alternative to adobe, and with some advantages.  A commercial industry has been advanced by eco-friendly contractors, manufacturers of the mechanical presses, and by cultural acceptance of the method.  In the [[United States]], most general contractors building with CEB are in the Southwestern states: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], and to a lesser extent in [[Texas]].  The methods and presses have been used for many years in [[Mexico]], and in [[developing countries]].

The [[South Africa]]n Department of Water Affairs and Forestry considers that CEB, locally called "'''Dutch brick'''" is an appropriate technology for a developing country, as are adobe, rammed earth and cob. All use natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=6|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Masibambane/documents/civil/CrossCuttingFeb08.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Critical Sustainability Pillars for service delivery in the Water Sector|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the International Institute for Energy Conservation was one of the winners of a [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]] for a project to make an energy-efficient Dutch brick-making machine for home construction in South Africa. By making cheaper bricks that use earth, the project would reduce housing costs while stimulating the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/29725/south-africa-poverty-reduction-winners|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Poverty reduction winners|publisher=IRIN|date=11 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would be mobile, allowing bricks to be made locally from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbdm/idea/housing-and-jobs-better-future|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Housing and Jobs for a Better Future|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of CEB production machines exist, from manual to semi-automated and fully automated,  with increasing capital-investment and production rates, and decreased labor.  Automated machines are more common in the developed world, and manual machines in the developing world.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages of the CEB system.   On-site materials can be used, which reduces cost, minimizes shipping costs for materials, and increases efficiency and sustainability.  The wait-time required to obtain materials is minimal, because after the blocks are pressed, materials are available very soon after a short drying period.  The uniformity of the blocks simplifies construction, and minimizes or eliminates the need for mortar, thus reducing both the labor and materials costs.  The blocks are strong, stable, water-resistant and long-lasting.
* CEB can be pressed from damp earth. Because it is not wet, the drying time is much shorter. Some soil conditions permit the blocks to go straight from the press onto the wall. A single mechanical press can produce from 800 to over 5,000 blocks per day, enough to build a {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} house in one day.   A high performance CEB press, of [[open source]] design, named "The Liberator", can produce from 8,000 to 17,000 or more blocks per day.  The production rate is limited more by the ability to get material into the machine, than the machine itself.
* Shipping cost: Suitable soils are often available at or near the construction site. [[Adobe]] and CEB are of similar weight, but distance from a source supply gives CEB an advantage.  Also, CEB can be made available in places where adobe manufacturing operations are non-existent.
* Uniformity: CEB can be manufactured to a predictable size and has true flat sides and 90-degree angle edges.  This makes design and costing easier.  This also provides the contractor the option of making the exteriors look like conventional [[stucco]] houses. 
* Presses allow blocks to be consistently made of uniform size, while also obtaining strengths that exceed the ASTM standard for concrete blocks (1900 psi).
* Non-toxic:  materials are completely natural, non-toxic, and do not out-gas
* Sound resistant:  an important feature in high-density neighborhoods, residential areas adjacent to industrial zones
* Fire resistant:  earthen walls do not burn
* Insect resistant: Insects are discouraged because the walls are solid and very dense, and have no food value
* [[Mold]] resistant:  there is no cellulose material - such as in wood, [[Oriented Strand Board]] or [[drywall]] - that can host [[mold]] or rot
* In India, CSEB's with cement stabilization have shown to be very beneficial. The observed compressive strength, flexural strength at 28 days of aging with 9% cement stabilization has been observed to be 3.2 MPa and 1 MPa respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267637559|accessdate=2014-11-11|title=Effect Of Varying Cement Proportions On Properties Of Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) - A Sustainable Low-Cost Housing Material|publisher=DOI: 10.13140/2.1.4966.4963 Conference: International Conference on Sustainable Civil Infrastructure, ASCE India Section 17–18 October 2014, At Hyderabad, India, Volume: pg 1000-1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presses==
CEB had very limited use prior to the 1980s. It was known in the 1950s in [[South America]], where one of the most well-known presses, the [[Cinva Ram]], was developed by Raul Ramirez in the Inter-American Housing Center (CINVA) in Bogota, Colombia.  The Cinva Ram is a single-block, manual-press that uses a long, hand-operated lever to drive a [[cam]], generating high pressure.

Industrial manufacturers produce much larger machines that run with diesel or gasoline engines and hydraulic presses that receive the soil/aggregate mixture through a hopper. This is fed into a chamber to create a block that is then ejected onto a conveyor.

During the 1980s, soil-pressing technology became widespread. [[France]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]] began to write standards. The [[Peace Corps]], [[USAID]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other programs began to implement it into housing projects.

==Finishing==
Completed walls require either a reinforced bond beam or a ring beam on top or between floors and if the blocks are not stabilized, a plaster finish, usually stucco wire/stucco cement and/or lime plaster. Stabilized blocks can be left exposed with no outer plaster finish. In tropical environments, polycarbonate varnish is often used to provide an additional layer of wet-weather protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Foundations==
Standards for foundations are similar to those for brick walls. A CEB wall is heavy. Footings must be at least 10&amp;nbsp;inches thick, with a minimum width that is 33 percent greater than the wall width. If a stem wall is used, it shall extend to an elevation not less than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  above the exterior finish grade. Rubble-filled foundation trench designs with a reinforced concrete grade beam above are allowed to support CEB construction.

==Strength==
Using the [[ASTM]] D1633-00 stabilization standard, a pressed and cured block must be submerged in water for four hours. It is then pulled from the water and immediately subjected to a compression test. The blocks must score at least a 300 [[pound-force per square inch]] (p.s.i) (2 MPa) minimum.  This is a higher standard than for adobe, which must score an ''average'' of at least 300 p.s.i. (2 MPa)

[[File:Castle_Union.jpg|thumb|[[Mushroom cloud]] with multiple condensation rings from the [[Castle Union]] 6.9 Mt hydrogen bomb test]]

A transient '''condensation cloud''', also called '''Wilson cloud''', is observable at large [[explosion]]s in [[humidity|humid]] air.

When a [[nuclear weapon]] or a large amount of a conventional [[explosive]] is detonated in sufficiently [[humidity|humid]] air, the "negative phase" of the [[shock wave]] causes a [[rarefaction]] (reduction in density) of the air surrounding the explosion, but not contained within it. This rarefaction results in a temporary cooling of that air, which causes a [[condensation]] of some of the water vapor contained in it. When the pressure and the temperature return to normal, the Wilson cloud dissipates.&lt;ref&gt;Glasstone, Samuel and Philip J. Dolan. ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', U.S. Dept. Of Defense/ Dept. Of Energy; 3rd Edition (1977), p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

Since heat does not leave the affected air mass, this change of pressure is [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]], with an associated change of temperature. In humid air, the drop in temperature in the most rarefied portion of the shock wave can bring the air temperature below its [[dew point]], at which moisture condenses to form a visible [[cloud]] of microscopic water droplets. Since the pressure effect of the wave is reduced by its expansion (the same pressure effect is spread over a larger radius), the vapor effect also has a limited radius. Such vapor can also be seen in low pressure regions during [[g-force|high–g]] subsonic maneuvers of aircraft in humid conditions.

Scientists observing the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests in 1946 at [[Bikini Atoll]] named that transitory cloud a "Wilson cloud" because of its similarity to the appearance of the inside of a [[Wilson cloud chamber]], an instrument they would have been familiar with. (The cloud chamber effect is caused by a temporary reduction in pressure in a closed system and marks the tracks of electrically-charged [[sub-atomic particle]]s.) Analysts of later nuclear bomb tests used the more general term ''condensation cloud''.

The shape of the shock wave, influenced by different speed in different altitudes, and the temperature and humidity of different atmospheric layers determines the appearance of the Wilson clouds. During [[nuclear test]]s, '''condensation rings''' around or above the fireball are commonly observed. Rings around the fireball may become stable and form rings around the rising stem of the [[mushroom cloud]].

The lifetime of the Wilson cloud during nuclear [[air burst]]s can be shortened by the [[thermal radiation]] from the fireball, which heats the cloud above the dew point and evaporates the droplets.

The same kind of condensation cloud is sometimes seen above the wings of aircraft in a moist atmosphere. The top of a wing has a reduction of air pressure as part of the process of generating lift. This reduction in air pressure causes a cooling, just as above, and the condensation of water vapor. Hence, the small, transient clouds that appear.

The [[vapor cone]] of a [[transonic]] aircraft is another example of a condensation cloud.

'''Crushed stone''' or '''angular rock''' is a form of [[construction aggregate]], typically produced by mining a suitable rock deposit and breaking the removed rock down to the desired size using [[crusher]]s. It is distinct from [[gravel]] which is produced by natural processes of weathering and erosion, and typically has a more rounded shape.

==Uses==
Angular crushed stone is the key material for [[macadam]] road construction which depends on the interlocking of the individual stones' angular faces for its strength.&lt;ref name="isbn90-5699-159-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Max Lay |title=Handbook of Road Technology (Transportation Studies) |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |location=Washington, DC |year= 1998|pages= 28|isbn=90-5699-159-0 | quote = The strength and stiffness of the course of compacted angular stone came from the mechanical interlock which developed between individual pieces of stone. The principle is still used in modem road construction and since 1820 McAdam's name has been remembered by the term macadam used to describe the courses of unbound angular stone which he introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crushed natural stone is also used similarly without a binder for [[riprap]], railroad [[track ballast]], and [[filter stone]]. It may be used with a binder in a [[composite material]] such as concrete, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]], or [[asphalt concrete]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-2605-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cunningham, William D. |author2=McKetta, John J. |title=Encyclopedia of chemical processing and design |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |location=New York, N.Y |year=1976 |pages= 284 |isbn=0-8247-2605-7 | quote = Crushed stone can be used without binder for a variety of construction or industrial applications, or it may be mixed with a matrix binding material, such as bituminous or portland  cement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Crushed stone is one of the most accessible [[natural resource]]s, and is a major basic [[raw material]] used by [[construction]], agriculture, and other industries. Despite the low value of its basic products, the crushed stone industry is a major contributor to and an indicator of the [[Measures of national income and output|economic well-being of a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/ |title=USGS Minerals Information: Crushed Stone |accessdate=2007-11-11 |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The demand for crushed stone is determined mostly by the level of construction activity, and, therefore, the demand for construction materials.&lt;ref name=Tepordei&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/stat/ |title= Statistical Compendium - Crushed Stone|accessdate=2007-11-11 | date=1997-11-04 | first = Valentin V. | last = Tepordei |publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |work= Minerals Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone resources of the world are very large. High-purity [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]] suitable for specialty uses are limited in many geographic areas. Crushed stone substitutes for [[roadbuilding]] include [[sand]] and [[gravel]], and [[slag]]. Substitutes for crushed stone used as construction aggregates include sand and gravel, iron and steel slag, [[sintered]] or expanded [[clay]] or [[shale]], and [[perlite]] or [[vermiculite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/stcrumcs07.pdf |title= Stone (Crushed)|accessdate=2007-11-11 |date = January 2007 | first = Jason Christopher | last = Willett |publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |work= Mineral Commodity Summaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:2d Av subway crush stone 72 jeh.jpg|thumb|Crushed stone being laid to underlie a road surface]]

Crushed stone is a high-volume, low-value [[commodity]]. The industry is highly competitive and is characterized by many operations serving local or regional markets. Production costs are determined mainly by the cost of labor, equipment, energy, and water, in addition to the costs of compliance with [[Environmental law|environmental]] and [[Occupational safety and health|safety]] regulations. These costs vary depending on geographic location, the nature of the deposit, and the number and type of products produced. Crushed stone has one of the lowest average by weight values of all mineral commodities. The average unit price increased from US$1.58 per metric ton, f.o.b. plant, in 1970 to US$4.39 in 1990. However, the unit price in constant 1982 dollars fluctuated between US$3.48 and US$3.91 per metric ton for the same period. Increased [[productivity]] achieved through increased use of [[automation]] and more efficient equipment was mainly responsible for maintaining the prices at this level.&lt;ref name=Tepordei/&gt;

Transportation is a major factor in the delivered price of crushed stone. The cost of moving crushed stone from the plant to the market often equals or exceeds the sale price of the product at the plant. Because of the high cost of transportation and the large quantities of bulk material that have to be shipped, crushed stone is usually marketed locally. The high cost of transportation is responsible for the wide dispersion of quarries, usually located near highly populated areas. However, increasing land values combined with local environmental concerns are moving crushed stone quarries farther from the end-use locations, increasing the price of delivered material. [[Economies of scale]], which might be realized if fewer, larger operations served larger marketing areas, would probably not offset the increased transportation costs.&lt;ref name=Tepordei/&gt;

==United States statistical data==
According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], 1.72&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes of crushed stone worth $13.8&amp;nbsp;billion was sold or used in 2006, of which 1.44&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes was used as [[construction aggregate]], 74.9&amp;nbsp;million tonnes used for cement manufacture, and 18.1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes used to make [[lime (material)|lime]]. Crushed [[marble]] sold or used totaled 11.8&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, the majority of which was ground very fine and used as [[calcium carbonate]].

In 2006, 9.40&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone (almost all [[limestone]] or [[dolomite]]) was used for [[soil]] treatment, primarily to reduce [[soil acidity]]. Soils tend to become acidic from heavy use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers, unless a [[soil conditioner]] is used. Using aglime  or [[agricultural lime]], a finely-ground limestone or dolomite, to change the soil from acidic to nearly neutral particularly benefits crops by maximizing availability of plant nutrients, and also by reducing aluminum or [[manganese]] toxicity, promoting soil microbe activity, and improving the soil structure.

In 2006, 5.29&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone (mostly limestone or dolomite) was used as a flux in [[blast furnaces]] and in certain steel furnaces to react with [[gangue]] minerals (i.e. [[silica]] and silicate impurities) to produce liquid [[slag]] that floats and can be poured off from the much denser molten metal (i.e., iron). The slag cools to become a stone-like material that is commonly crushed and recycled as [[construction aggregate]].

In addition, 4.53&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of crushed stone was used for fillers and extenders (including asphalt fillers or extenders), 2.71&amp;nbsp;million tonnes for sulfur oxide removal-mine dusting-acid water treatment, and 1.45&amp;nbsp;million tonnes sold or used for poultry grit or mineral food.

Crushed stone is recycled primarily as [[construction aggregate]] or concrete.

==Landscape use==
Crushed stone or '[[road metal]]' is used in [[landscape design]] and gardening for gardens, parks, and municipal and private projects as a [[mulch]], [[walkway]], path, and [[driveway]] pavement, and cell infill for modular [[permeable paving]] units. As a mineral mulch its benefits include erosion control, water conservation, weed suppression, and aesthetic qualities. It is often seen used in [[rock garden]]s and [[cactus garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/factsheets/mulch/mulchland.html#stone Cornell University: Gardening Resources - mulches]. accessed 5.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://landscaping.about.com/od/drivewaysandwalkways1/f/gravel_driveway.htm AboutGardens: Crushed stone driveways]. accessed 5.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deistic evolution''' is a position in the [[origins debate]] which involves accepting the [[scientific]] evidence for [[evolution]] and age of the [[universe]] whilst advocating the view that a [[deist]]ic [[God]] created the universe but has not interfered since. The position is a counterpoint to [[theistic evolution]] and is endorsed by those who believe in both [[deism]] and the veracity of science.

==Various views on deistic evolution==

In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8birAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;dq=deistic+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMI2NPFwPLdxgIViBo-Ch1TWwAE#v=onepage&amp;q=deistic%20evolution&amp;f=false Christian Theology]'', by Millard J. Erickson, 2013, is written:

{{quote|Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws its development has followed. Thus, he programmed the process and then withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator Emeritus. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution, for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process.
Deistic evolution has little difficulty with the scientific data. There is a definite conflict, however, between deism's view of an absentee God and the biblical picture of a God who has been involved in a whole series of creative acts. In particular, both Genesis accounts of the origin of human beings indicate that God definitely and distinctly willed and acted to bring them into existence. In addition, deistic evolution conflicts with the scriptural doctrine of providence, according to which God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation.}}

The [[psychologist]] Steve Stewart-Williams&lt;ref&gt;[http://psy.swan.ac.uk/staff/stewart-williams/ Homepage for Dr Steve Stewart-Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' (2010) states:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolutionists hold that God created the universe and the laws of nature... but that once the ball was rolling, he ceased to intervene in the day-today running of the world or in the course of natural law. God was like the ether after Einstein: he no longer had any role to play in the universe'''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' 2010 p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stewart-Williams further writes that deistic evolution strips [[God]] of what most religious believers consider central. Any deistic God is not around for [[prayer]]s, [[miracles]] or to intervene in people's lives and that because of this it is unpopular with [[monotheistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic Evolution adheres to the concept of some form of God, but denies any personal God. A recent defender of deistic evolution was [[Michael Anthony Corey]], author of the book ''Back to Darwin: The Scientific Case for Deistic Evolution'' (1994).

Some scholars have written that [[Charles Darwin]] was an advocate of deistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Christian C. Young, Mark A. Largent ''Evolution and Creationism: A Documentary and Reference Guide'' 2007, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic evolution is similarly the operative idea  in [[Pandeism]], which has been counted amongst the handful of spiritual beliefs which "are compatible with modern [[science]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Some of us think that postmodernity represents a similar change of dominant worldviews, one which could turn out to be just as singular as modernity by being a stunning amalgam of James and Weber. If we are correct, then the changed attitudes, assumptions, and values might work together to change ways of life which in turn transform our geographies of mind and being, that is, both the actual physical landscapes and the mental valuescapes we inhabit. One increasingly common outcome of this ongoing transformation, itself a symptom perhaps of post-industrial secular societies, is the movement away from self-denial toward a denial of the supernatural. This development promises to fundamentally alter future geographies of mind and being by shifting the locus of causality from an exalted Godhead to the domain of Nature. How this Nature is ultimately defined has broad repercussions for the, at times, artificial distinction between religious and secular worldviews. For Levine (2011), "secularism is a positive, not a negative, condition, not a denial of the  world of spirit and of religion, but an affirmation of the world we're living in now ... such a world is capable of bringing us to the condition of 'fullness' that religion has always promised" (Levine quoted in Wood 2011). For others, this "fullness" is present in more religious-oriented pantheistic or pandeistic belief systems with, in the latter case, the inclusion of God as the ever unfolding expression of a complex universe with an identifiable beginning but no teleological direction necessarily present.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theistic predeterminism==
Deistic evolution is not the same as [[theistic evolution]], yet they are sometimes confused. The difference rests on the difference between a theistic god that is interested in, if not actively involved in, the outcome of his creation and humanity specifically and a [[deism|deistic god]] that is either disinterested in the outcome, and holds no special place for humanity, or will not intervene. Often, there is no discernible difference between the two positions—the choice of terminology has more to do with the believer and her or his need for a god, than fitting into a mostly arbitrary dictionary or academic definition.

==Criticism from Christian Creationists==

Deistic evolution has been criticised by Christian [[creationists]] as being incompatible with [[Christianity]] since it contradicts a literal reading of the [[Bible]] and more importantly, leaves no role for the "Christian personal God".&lt;ref&gt;James K. A. Smith, Amos Yong ''Science and the Spirit: A Pentecostal Engagement With the Sciences'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liberty: a magazine of religious freedom: Volumes 86-88, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

M. J. Erickson wrote that deistic evolution is in conflict with the scriptural doctrine of providence according to which "God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation."&lt;ref&gt;Erickson M.J., "Christian Theology", 1985, Baker, Grand Rapids, MI, pp. 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles P. Grannan wrote in 1894, "Another baseless assumption of negative critics is that the general principles of Atheistic and Deistic evolution, admitted by many scientists to account for the origin of the various species of plants and animals, should also be applied to explain the origin of the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;"Higher Criticism and the Bible," by Charles P. Grannan, DD, PhD, in ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', 1894, Volume 19, Page 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Wesley Rishell criticized the concept in 1899, comparing it to the notion (false, in his view), that [[gravity]] was a property of matter instead of a continued action of God:

{{quote|If evolution is God's method of creating he is still at work. Theistic Deism and evolution is possible, but deistic evolution is a contradiction in terms. Again, it is all a mere supposition that God created the world and endowed it with forces which will of necessity work out his will. It is impossible for us to say that God put forth energy in the beginning and then ceased. It is, to say the least, as probable that gravitation is a divine force constantly exerted on matter in a certain way as that it is a divine force deposited in matter once for all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of the Christian Faith'' by Charles Wesley Rishell, 1899, Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Science==

Deistic evolution does not oppose or contradict [[evolution]] or come into conflict with [[science]] as it says that a God started the process and then left it to natural processes. However deism is still a religious philosophy.

Stewart-Williams wrote regarding deistic evolution and science:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolution eliminates any immediate conflict between science and belief in God. Anyone who believes that God's role was merely to create the laws of nature can accept the scientific worldview in its totality; they simply add the proviso that 'God did it' - i.e., that God is responsible for the world that science describes'''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is considerable room for this "[[god of the gaps]]" view, since scientific observation is entirely unable to shed any light on what happened during the [[Planck epoch]], the earliest 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds in the history of the universe. All development since this initial creative act merely follows laws and principles which He created:

*God created the universe, perhaps using the "big bang" about 15,000 million years ago as his method. He set up basic laws to govern the running of the universe, and then left the scene entirely. God has not been seen since. The earth coalesced about 4 or 5 thousand million years ago without any input from God. Later, elementary life forms formed, which evolved into the animals and plant life that we see today through purely natural forces. It is essentially identical to naturalistic evolution, excepts that it reserves one action for God: that of initially creating the matter of the universe. This belief is common among Deists. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_world3.htm]
*Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws which its devel- opment has followed. Thus, he programmed the process. Then he withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator emeritus. The progress of the created order is free of direct influence by God. He is the Creator of everything, but only the first living form was directly created. All the rest of God's creating has been done indirectly. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process. [http://www.asa3.org/archive/evolution/199505-10/0171.html]

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] disagrees with the doctrine of deistic evolution. In November 2005, Pope Benedict addressed a general audience of 25,000 in [[St. Peter's Square]]:

:When the Pontiff finished his address, he put his papers to one side and commented on the thought of St. Basil the Great, a Doctor of the Church, who said that some, "deceived by the atheism they bear within them, imagined the universe deprived of a guide and order, at the mercy of chance. I believe the words of this fourth-century Father are of amazing timeliness," said Benedict XVI. "How many are these 'some' today? Deceived by atheism, they believe and try to demonstrate that it is scientific to think that everything lacks a guide and order," he continued.

The '''eagle bone whistle''' is a highly [[sacred]] religious object, used by some members of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] spiritual societies in particularly sacred ceremonies. They are made from bones of either the American [[bald eagle]] or the American [[golden eagle]], and are considered extremely powerful spiritual objects.&lt;ref name="Maroukis"&gt;Maroukis, Thomas Constantine (2005).

"Some of the visitors join us in all our social, spiritual, and other activities and become adopted members.

==Use==
Eagle bone whistles are only used in certain ceremonies in the Southwest and [[Plains Indians|Plains]] cultures.&lt;ref name="Maroukis"/&gt; The eagle bone whistle may be considered as a ceremonial or sacred object which may not be considered a musical instrument, if music is defined as entertainment: "There is no time or need...&lt;!--here--&gt;to wallow in distinctions between a feather-and-bone raptor and a bone whistle avian mysticism; one would no doubt end in dichotomous Western readings thereof."&lt;ref name="Gannon"/&gt;

University of Mississippi. {{ISBN|9781578060962}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eagle bone whistles are used in a number of [[Sun Dance]] cultures, such as the [[Crow tribe|Crow]].&lt;ref name="Shoshoni"/&gt; The eagle-bone whistle is also used by the [[Lakota people]] in certain ceremonies,&lt;ref name="Gannon"&gt;Gannon, Thomas C.

==Federal law==
Both the bald and golden eagle are protected by federal law: the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] (MBTA) prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests except as authorized under a valid permit as outlined at  [[Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations|50 CFR]] 21.11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/22.1 |title= 50 CFR 22.1 - What is the purpose of this part? |publisher=Cornell University Law School - Legal Information Institute | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/RegulationsPolicies/mbta/43603%20QA%201013%20rule.pdf | date=17 September 1999 | title = Migratory Bird Management Information: List of Protected Birds (10.13) Questions and Answers | publisher = [[US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]] | accessdate = 7 August 2015 | format = PDF}} As amended 20 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The MBTA authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine if, and by what means, the hunting of migratory birds should be allowed, as well as to adopt and implement suitable regulations permitting and governing the hunting of any type of migratory bird (for example, hunting seasons for ducks and geese). The [[Eagle feather law]] is another name for the exemptions to this act that are sometimes granted to enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes. Penalties under the MBTA include a maximum of two years imprisonment and $250,000 fine for a felony conviction and six months imprisonment or $5,000 fine for a misdemeanor conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/environment/ac-cn-eagles-drones-0423-story.html Drone pilot buzzed Bald Eagle's Nest] Capital Gazette.

[[File:Ritten (61).JPG|thumb|Pyramids in Autumn, as seen from Nicholas chapel]]
The '''[[Hoodoo (geology)|earth pyramids]]''' in [[South Tyrol]] are a special natural phenomenon that comes about in particular terrain, usually after a landslide or an unhinging of the earth.

The main cause of the formation of earth pyramids is the continuous alternation of periods of torrential rain and
drought. These phenomena, in particularly friable terrain, over the years, increasingly erode the ground and form such earth pyramids. Usually the pyramids are formed in terrain very well sheltered from wind so that they cannot be damaged by it.

Moreover, the life of the earth pyramids is strongly dependent on the climate which reigns during the time in which it is shaped by the rock that covers it.

There are several earth pyramids that can be safely visited. Among the most famous and admired the
following are the most outstanding:
* the [[earth pyramids of Ritten]], a [[plateau]] above [[Bolzano]], which are divided into three distinct groups near the villages Klobenstein, Oberbozen, and Unterinn;
* the [[earth pyramids of Platten]] near [[Percha]] in the [[Puster Valley]].

Other, less famous, earth pyramids are:
* in [[Terenten]], [[Puster Valley]];
* in [[Mölten]];
* in [[Jenesien]] near Bolzano;
* in the hinterland of [[Merano]]: in [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], [[Kuens]], and [[Riffian, South Tyrol|Riffian]];
* in [[Karneid]] and Steinegg, one of its hamlets.
* in Neustift in the Rigger valley.
* in [[Segonzano]] in the Cembra valley in the adjoinig province Trentino (not South Tyrol any more).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16164">In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''evolutionary algorithm''' ('''EA''') is a [[subset]] of [[evolutionary computation]],&lt;ref name="EVOALG"&gt;{{cite article|last=Vikhar|first=P. A.|title=Evolutionary algorithms: A critical review and its future prospects|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7955308&amp;isnumber=7955253|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Global Trends in Signal Processing, Information Computing and Communication (ICGTSPICC)|publisher= Jalgaon, 2016, pp. 261-265|isbn=978-1-5090-0467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a generic population-based [[metaheuristic]] [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[algorithm]]. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]], such as [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], and [[natural selection|selection]]. [[Candidate solution]]s to the [[optimization problem]] play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[fitness function]] determines the quality of the solutions (see also [[loss function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying [[fitness landscape]]. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of [[microevolution|microevolutionary processes]] and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor.&lt;ref name="VLSI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohoon|first=J et al.|title=Evolutionary algorithms for the physical design of VLSI circuits|url= https://www.ifte.de/mitarbeiter/lienig/cohoon.pdf|journal=Advances in Evolutionary Computing: Theory and Applications|publisher= Springer, pp. 683-712, 2003|isbn=978-3-540-43330-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. [[Fitness approximation]] is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.

==Implementation==

Step One: Generate the initial [[population]] of [[individual]]s randomly. (First generation)

Step Two: Evaluate the [[Fitness function|fitness]] of each individual in that population (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.)

Step Three: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination:
#Select the best-fit individuals for [[reproduce|reproduction]]. (Parents)
# [[Breed]] new individuals through [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] operations to give birth to [[offspring]].
# Evaluate the individual fitness of new individuals.
# Replace least-fit population with new individuals.

==Types==
Similar techniques differ in [[genetic representation]] and other implementation details, and the nature of the particular applied problem.
*[[Genetic algorithm]] – This is the most popular type of EA. One seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers (traditionally binary, although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved),&lt;ref name=VLSI/&gt; by applying operators such as recombination and mutation (sometimes one, sometimes both).  This type of EA is often used in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. Another name for it is ''fetura'', from the Latin for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Roland, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPW3Y10 ''Wayward World'']. Novel that uses fetura to select candidates for public office.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Genetic programming]] – Here the solutions are in the form of computer programs, and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem.
*[[Evolutionary programming]] – Similar to genetic programming, but the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve.
*[[Gene expression programming]] – Like genetic programming, GEP also evolves computer programs but it explores a genotype-phenotype system, where computer programs of different sizes are encoded in linear chromosomes of fixed length.
*[[Evolution strategy]] – Works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions, and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates.
*[[Differential evolution]] – Based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for [[numerical optimization]] problems.
*[[Neuroevolution]] – Similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights. The genome encoding can be direct or indirect.
*[[Learning classifier system]] – Here the solution is a set of classifiers (rules or conditions). A Michigan-LCS evolves at the level of individual classifiers whereas a Pittsburgh-LCS uses populations of classifier-sets. Initially, classifiers were only binary, but now include real, neural net, or [[S-expression]] types. Fitness is typically determined with either a strength or accuracy based [[reinforcement learning]] or [[supervised learning]] approach.

==Comparison to biological processes==

A possible limitation{{According to whom|date=May 2013}} of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear [[genotype-phenotype distinction]]. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as [[embryogenesis]] to become a mature [[phenotype]]. This indirect [[encoding]] is believed to make the genetic search more robust (i.e. reduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve the [[evolvability]] of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Hornby and J.B. Pollack. "Creating high-level components with a generative representation for body-brain evolution".

''Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing Special Section on Evolutionary Robotics'', 2009. Trondheim, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; Such indirect (a.k.a. generative or developmental) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;J. Clune, C. Ofria, and R. T. Pennock, [http://jeffclune.com/publications/Clune-HyperNEATandRegularity.pdf "How a generative encoding fares as problem-regularity decreases"], in ''PPSN'' (G. Rudolph, T. Jansen, S. M. Lucas, C. Poloni, and N. Beume, eds.), vol. 5199 of ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', pp. 358–367, Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the field of [[artificial development|artificial embryogeny]], or artificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns. And [[gene expression programming]] successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system, where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, C., 2001.

*[[Memetic algorithm]] – A hybrid method, inspired by [[Richard Dawkins]]'s notion of a meme, it commonly takes the form of a population-based algorithm coupled with individual learning procedures capable of performing local refinements. Emphasizes the exploitation of problem-specific knowledge, and tries to orchestrate local and global search in a synergistic way.

'''Evolutionary graph theory''' is an area of research lying at the intersection of [[graph theory]], [[probability theory]], and [[mathematical biology]]. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how [[topology]] affects [[evolution]] of a [[population]]. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by [[Erez Lieberman]], Christoph Hauert and [[Martin Nowak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = E. | last2 = Hauert | first2 = C. | last3 = Nowak | first3 = M. A. | doi = 10.1038/nature03204 | title = Evolutionary dynamics on graphs | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7023 | pages = 312–316 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15662424 | pmc = | bibcode = 2005Natur.433..312L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of a weighted [[directed graph]] and the weight w&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt; of an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'' denotes the probability of ''i'' replacing ''j''. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] where fitter types propagate more readily. 
One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the ''fixation probability'', which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the ''isothermal theorem'', a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding [[Moran process]] if and only if it is isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. Thus, for example, a [[complete graph]] with equal weights describes a Moran process. The fixation probability is
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
\rho_M = \frac{1-r^{-1}} { 1-r^{-N} } 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the relative fitness of the invading type.

Graphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt;/math&gt; is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding [[Moran process]] &lt;math&gt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex ''i-1'' can replace vertex ''i'' (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is &lt;math&gt; \rho_G = 1/N &lt;/math&gt; (where ''N'' is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; for all ''r'' greater than 1, this graph is by definition a suppressor of selection.

Evolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a [[coalescing random walk]], or as a stochastic process.  We may consider the mutant population on a graph as a random walk between absorbing barriers representing mutant extinction and mutant fixation.  For highly symmetric graphs, we can then use martingales to find the ''fixation probability'' as illustrated by Monk (2018).

Also [[Evolutionary game theory|evolutionary games]] can be studied on graphs where again an edge between ''i'' and ''j'' means that these two individuals will play a game against each other.

Closely related stochastic processes include the [[voter model]], which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8965">'''Faith McNulty''' (November 28, 1918 – April 10, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[non-fiction]] author, probably best known for her 1980 literary journalism genre book ''[[The Burning Bed]]''. She is also known for her authorship of wildlife pieces and books, including children's books.

Faith Trumbull Corrigan was born in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; the daughter of a judge. She attended [[Barnard College]] for one year,&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; then attended [[Rhode Island State College]]. But she dropped out of college once she got a job as a copy girl at the ''[[New York Daily News]]''. She later went to work for [[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]]. She worked for the U.S. [[Office of War Information]] in [[London]] during [[World War II]].

McNulty was a staff writer at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' [[magazine]] from 1953 to 1994.&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; In 1980, a collection of her ''New Yorker'' work was published as ''The Wildlife Stories of Faith McNulty''.&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; For many years, she edited the annual ''New Yorker'' compilation of the year's best children's books.

She also frequently wrote [[children's literature|children's books]] on wildlife, including ''How to Dig a Hole to the Other Side of the World'' in 1979 and ''When I Lived With Bats'' in 1998. Her 1966 book ''The Whooping Crane: The Bird that Defies Distinction'' was written for adults.

Her husband, [[John McNulty (journalist)|John McNulty]], was also a writer&lt;ref name=NYSLTree/&gt; for ''The New Yorker'' and with [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Gay Talese]] and [[James Baldwin]], a major figure in the development of the literary genre of [[Creative nonfiction]], which is also known as [[literary journalism]] or literature in fact. As earlier here noted, having herself been years exposed to [[Harold Ross]]' New Yorker magazine's rarefied environment, which was then so promoting of this evolving genre, Faith's own major nonfiction work, ''The Burning Bed'', is, itself, a quintessential and quality example of the genre of literary journalism or, as Thomas Wolfe once labeled it, the “[[New Journalism]]”.  After her husband John died in 1956, Faith remarried, to Richard Martin, a set designer and an inventive designer of set props.

''The Burning Bed'' told the true story of Francine Hughes, who set fire to the bedroom in which her husband was sleeping. Hughes defended herself by saying that her husband had been [[domestic abuse|abusing]] her for 13 years. The jury at her trial ruled that she had been temporarily insane, and she was found not guilty.

Faith had fonder memories of life with kinder family, however. ''"I can remember my father in his nightshirt, digging for worms for the baby robin in the bathroom. That's the kind of household it was; I had [[woodchuck]]s in the bathroom, [[cat]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[chipmunk]]s"'', McNulty once said.

Towards the end of her life, she wrote a weekly column for ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' on a local [[animal shelter]] run by the [[Animal Welfare League]]. Her mother had founded the Animal Welfare League in southern [[Rhode Island]]. McNulty had long been known for taking in stray animals at her farm.

She suffered a stroke in 2004. She died at her farm in [[Wakefield, Rhode Island]].

McNulty's last book was illustrated by [[Steven Kellogg]] and published by [[Scholastic Books]] in 2005, ''If You Decide to Go to the Moon''—a picture book written in the second person.&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt; Next year (after McNulty's death) it won a major "year's best" children's literary award, the [[Boston Globe–Horn Book Award]] for Nonfiction.&lt;ref name=bghb2011/&gt;

[[File:Annual Average Temperature Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of annual average temperatures as a function of location.]]

The five main [[latitude]] regions of the Earth's surface comprise '''geographical zones''', divided by the major [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]]. The differences between them relate to [[climate]]. They are as follows: 

#The [[Arctic|North frigid zone]], between the [[Arctic Circle]] 66.5° N and the [[North Pole]] 90° N. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.
#The [[North temperate zone]], between the  [[Tropic of Cancer]] 23.5° N and the Arctic Circle 66.5° N. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Tropics|Torrid zone]], between the Tropic of Cancer 23.5° N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 23.5° S. Covers 39.78% of Earth's surface.
#The [[South temperate zone]], between the Tropic of Capricorn 23.5° S and the [[Antarctic Circle]] 66.5° S. Covers 25.99% of Earth's surface.
#The [[Antarctic|South frigid zone]], from Antarctic Circle 66.5° S and the [[South Pole]] 90° S. Covers 4.12% of Earth's surface.

{{legend|#ef8888|Tropical}} ]]

On the basis of latitudinal extent, the globe is divided into three broad heat zones.

==Torrid Zone==

The Torrid is also known as the [[Tropics]]. The zone is bounded on the north by the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the south by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]; these latitudes mark the northern and southern extremes in which the sun seasonally passes directly overhead. This happens annually, but in the region between, the sun passes overhead twice a year.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in the sun's apparent northward migration after the March [[equinox]], it passes overhead once, then after the [[June solstice]], at which time it reaches the [[Tropic of Cancer]], it passes over again on its apparent southward journey. After the September equinox the sun passes into the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. It then passes similarly over the southern tropical regions until it reaches the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] at the [[December solstice]], and back again as it returns northwards to the [[Equator]].

==Temperate Zones==

In the two Temperate Zones also known as tropical zone not, consisting of the [[tepid]] [[latitudes]], the Sun is never directly overhead, and the climate is mild, generally ranging from warm to cool. The four annual seasons, [[Spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]] and [[winter]], occur in these areas. The North Temperate Zone includes [[Europe]], [[Northern Asia]], and [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]]. The South Temperate Zone includes Southern [[Australasia]], southern [[South America]], and [[Southern Africa]].

==Frigid Zones==

The two Frigid Zones, or [[polar regions of Earth|polar region]]s, experience the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]] for part of the year - at the edge of the zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the [[Geographical pole|pole]]) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The Frigid Zones are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.It receives slanting rays of the sun as this region lies farthest from the equator. Summer season in this region lies lasts for about 2 to 3 months and there is almost 24 hour sunlight during summer.

==History==
The concept of a geographical zone was first hypothesized by the ancient Greek scholar [[Parmenides]]&lt;ref&gt;Strab. 2,2,1-2 in: A. H. Coxon and R. D. McKirahan (eds), The Fragments of Parmenides: A Critical Text With Introduction, and Translation, the Ancient Testimonia and a Commentary, 2nd edn (Phronesis: Supplementary Volumes 3; Assen, Dover (NH), 2009), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; and lastingly modified by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]], [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Bekker numbers|Bekker numbers]] 362a33-362b29&lt;/ref&gt; Both philosophers theorized the Earth divided into three types of climatic zones based on their distance from the equator.

Like Parmeneides, thinking that the area near the equator was too hot for habitation, Aristotle dubbed the region around the equator (from 23.5° N to 23.5° S) the "Torrid Zone." Both philosophers reasoned the region from the Arctic Circle to the pole to be permanently frozen. This region, thought uninhabitable, was called the "Frigid Zone." The only area believed to be habitable was the northern "Temperate Zone" (the southern one not having been discovered), lying between the "Frigid Zones" and the "Torrid Zone". However, humans have inhabited almost all climates on Earth, including inside the Arctic Circle.

As knowledge of the Earth's geography improved, a second "Temperate Zone" was discovered south of the equator, and a second "Frigid Zone" was discovered around the [[Antarctic]]. Although Aristotle's map was oversimplified, the general idea was correct. Today, the most commonly used climate map is the [[Köppen climate classification]], developed by Russian climatologist of German descent and amateur botanist [[Wladimir Köppen]] (1846–1940), which divides the world into five major climate regions, based on average annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature.

These two climate states last for  millions of years and should not be confused with [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods, which occur only during an icehouse period and tend to last less than 1 million years. There are [[Timeline of glaciation|five known great glaciation]]s in Earth's climate history; the main factors involved in changes of the [[paleoclimate]] are believed to be the concentration of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], changes in the [[Earth's orbit]], and oceanic and [[orogenic]] changes due to [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate dynamics]]. Greenhouse and icehouse periods have profoundly shaped the [[evolution]] of life on Earth.

==Greenhouse Earth==
===Overview of greenhouse Earth===
A "greenhouse Earth" or "hothouse Earth" is a period in which there are no continental [[glacier]]s whatsoever on the planet, the levels of carbon dioxide and other [[greenhouse gas]]es (such as [[water vapor]] and [[methane]]) are high, and [[sea surface temperature]]s (SSTs) range from 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82.4&amp;nbsp;°F) in the [[tropics]] to 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) in the [[polar region]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Gregory|author2=Paul J.

===Causes of greenhouse Earth===
There are several theories as to how a greenhouse Earth can come about.  The geological record shows CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases are abundant during this time. [[Tectonic movement]]s were extremely active during the more well-known greenhouse ages (such as 368 million years ago in the [[Paleozoic]] Era). Because of [[Divergent boundary|continental rifting]] ([[continental plate]]s moving away from each other) [[volcanic]] activity becomes more prominent, producing more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and heating up the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=Richard D.|author2=Karen L.

==Icehouse Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{see also|Ice age|Timeline of glaciation}}

===Overview of icehouse Earth===
An "icehouse Earth" is the earth as it experiences an [[ice age]]. Unlike a greenhouse Earth, an icehouse Earth has [[ice sheet]]s present, and these sheets wax and wane throughout times known as [[glacial periods]] and [[interglacial|interglacial period]]s. During an icehouse Earth, greenhouse gases tend to be less abundant, and temperatures tend to be cooler globally. The Earth is currently in an icehouse stage,&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montanez|first=Isabel|author2=G.S. Soreghan|title=Earth's Fickle Climate: Lessons Learned from Deep-Time Ice Ages|journal=Geotimes|date=March 2006|volume=51|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ice sheets are present on both [[Geographical pole|pole]]s and glacial periods have occurred at regular intervals over the past million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monnin |first1=E. |last2=Indermühle |first2=A. |last3=Dällenbach |first3=A. |last4=Flückiger |first4=J. |last5=Stauffer |first5=B. |last6=Stocker |first6=T.

===Causes of icehouse Earth===
The causes of an icehouse state are much debated, because not much is really known about the transition periods between greenhouse to icehouse climates and what could make the climate so different. One important aspect is clearly the decline of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, possibly due to low volcanic activity.

Other important issues are the movement of the tectonic plates and the opening and closing of oceanic gateways.&lt;ref name="Smith-p337-340"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alan G.|author2=Kevin T. Pickering|title=Oceanic gateways as a critical factor to initiate icehouse Earth|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|year=2003|volume=160|pages=337–340|doi=10.1144/0016-764902-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seem to play a crucial part in icehouse Earths because they can bring forth cool waters from very deep water circulations that could assist in creating ice sheets or thermal isolation of areas. Examples of this occurring are the opening of the [[Oligocene#The opening of the Tasman Gateway|Tasmanian gateway]] 36.5 million years ago that separated [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]] and which is believed to have set off the [[Cenozoic]] icehouse,&lt;ref name="Exon-p11-17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Exon|first=N.|author2=J.

Malone |title=The Opening of the Tasmanian Gateway Drove Cenozoic Paleoclimate: Results of Leg 189|journal=JOIDES|year=2000|volume=26|pages=11–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of the [[Drake Passage]] 32.8 million years ago by the separation of [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latimer|first=J.C.|author2=G.

The revealed fresh [[soil]]s act as [[scrubber]]s of carbon dioxide, which can significantly affect the amount of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. An example of this is the collision between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Asia]]n continent, which created the [[Himalayas|Himalayan Mountains]] about 50 million years ago.

=== Glacials and interglacials ===
{{main|Glacial period|Interglacial}}
Within icehouse states, there are "[[glacial period|glacial]]" and "[[interglacial]]" periods that cause ice sheets to build up or retreat. The causes for these glacial and interglacial periods are mainly variations in the movement of the earth around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Broecker-p49-56"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broecker|first=Wallace S.|author2=George H. Denton|title=What Drives Glacial Cycles|journal=Scientific American|date=January 1990|pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomical components, discovered by the Serbian geophysicist [[Milutin Milanković]] and now known as [[Milankovitch cycles]], include the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth, the [[orbital eccentricity]] (or shape of the [[orbit]]) and the [[precession]] (or wobble) of the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's spin]]. The tilt of the axis tends to fluctuate between 21.5° to 24.5° and back every 41,000 years on the vertical axis. This change actually affects the [[seasonality]] upon the earth, since more or less [[Insolation|solar radiation]] hits certain areas of the planet more often on a higher tilt, while less of a tilt would create a more even set of seasons worldwide. These changes can be seen in ice cores, which also contains information that shows that during glacial times (at the maximum extension of the ice sheets), the atmosphere had lower levels of carbon dioxide. This may be caused by the increase or redistribution of the [[acid]]/[[Base (chemistry)|base]] balance with [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] [[ion]]s that deals with [[alkalinity]]. During an Icehouse, only 20% of the time is spent in interglacial, or warmer times.&lt;ref name="Broecker-p49-56" /&gt;

=== Snowball earth ===
{{main|Snowball Earth}}
A "[[snowball earth]]" is the complete opposite of greenhouse Earth, in which the earth's surface is completely frozen over; however, a snowball earth technically does not have continental ice sheets like during the icehouse state. "The Great Infra-[[Cambrian]] Ice Age" has been claimed to be the host of such a world, and in 1964, the scientist [[W. Brian Harland]] brought forth his discovery of indications of glaciers in [[low latitudes]] (Harland and Rudwick). This became a problem for Harland because of the thought of the "Runaway Snowball Paradox" (a kind of [[Snowball effect]]) that, once the earth enters the route of becoming a snowball earth, it would never be able to leave that state. However, in 1992 {{ill|Joseph Kirschvink|display=1|de}} brought up a solution to the paradox. It is believed that since the continents at this time were huddled at the low and mid-latitudes that there was a great cooling event by planetary [[albedo]], or reflection of the earth’s surface. Kirschvink explained that the way to get out of the snowball could be connected to carbon dioxide, since volcanic activity would not halt, and that the buildup and lack of "[[scrubber|scrubbing]]" of this carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, that the earth would return to a greenhouse state. Some scientists believe that the end of the snowball Earth caused an event known as the [[Cambrian Explosion]], which produced the beginnings of [[multi-cellular]] life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maruyama|first=S.|author2=M. Santosh|title=Models on Snowball Earth and Cambrian explosion: A synopsis|journal=Gondwana Research|year=2008|volume=14|pages=22–32|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2008.01.004|bibcode=2008GondR..14...22M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some biologists claim that a complete snowball Earth could not have happened since [[photosynthetic]] life would not have survived underneath many meters of ice without [[sunlight]]. However, it has been observed that, even under meters of thick ice around Antarctica, sunlight shows through. Most scientists{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} today believe that a "hard" Snowball Earth, one completely covered by ice, is probably impossible. However, a "slushball earth", with points of openings near the [[equator]], is possible.

Recent studies may have again complicated the idea of a snowball earth. In October 2011, a team of French researchers announced that the carbon dioxide during the last speculated "snowball earth" may have been lower than originally stated, which provides a challenge in finding out how Earth was able to get out of its state and if it were a snowball or slushball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CNRS|first=Delegation Paris Michel-Ange|title=Snowball Earth's hypothesis challenged|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/000102083450.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=24 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==

===Causes===
The [[Eocene]], which occurred between 53 and 49 million years ago, was the Earth's warmest temperature period for 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herath|first=Anuradha K.|title=From Greenhouse to icehouse|url=http://www.astrobio.net./exclusive/3320/from-greenhouse-to-icehouse|work=Astrobio|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this "super-greenhouse" eventually became an icehouse by the late Eocene. It was believed that the decline of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caused this change, though there are possible [[positive feedback]]s, or added influence that contributes to the cooling.

The best record we have for a transition from an icehouse to a greenhouse period where plant life exists is during the [[Permian]] [[Age (geology)|epoch]] that occurred around 300 million years ago. In 40 million years a major transition took place, causing the Earth to change from a moist, icy planet where [[rainforest]]s covered the tropics, into a hot, dry, and windy location where little could survive. Professor [[Isabel P. Montañez]] of [[University of California, Davis]], who has researched this time period, found the climate to be "highly unstable" and "marked by dips and rises in carbon dioxide".&lt;ref name="UCDavis"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of California-Davis|title=A Bumpy Shift from Ice House to Greenhouse|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070104144854.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts===
The Eocene-Oligocene transition, the latest transition occurring approximately 34 million years ago, resulted in rapid global temperature decrease, the glaciation of Antarctica and a series of biotic extinction events. The most dramatic species turnover event associated with this time period is the [[Grande Coupure]], a period which saw the replacement of European tree-dwelling and leaf-eating mammal species by migratory species from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prothero|first=D. R.|date=1994-01-01|title=The Late Eocene-Oligocene Extinctions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.001045|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=22|issue=1|pages=145–165|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.001045|bibcode=1994AREPS..22..145P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
The science of [[paleoclimatology]] attempts to understand the history of greenhouse and icehouse conditions over geological time. Through the study of [[ice core]]s, [[dendrochronology]], [[ocean]] and [[lake]] [[sediment]]s ([[varve]]), [[palynology]] ([[fossil]]ized [[pollen]]) and [[isotope]] analysis (such as [[Radiometric dating]] and stable isotope analysis), scientists can create models of past climate. One study has shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during the [[Permian]] age rocked back and forth between 250 [[parts per million]] (which is close to present-day levels) up to 2,000 parts per million.&lt;ref name="UCDavis" /&gt; Studies on lake sediments suggest that the "Hothouse" or "super-Greenhouse" [[Eocene]] was in a "permanent [[El Nino]] state" after the 10&amp;nbsp;°C warming of the deep ocean and high latitude surface temperatures shut down the [[Pacific Ocean]]'s El Nino-[[Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=Matthew|author2=Rodrigo Caballero|title=Eocene El Nino: Evidence for Robust Tropical Dynamics in the "Hothouse"|journal=Science|date=7 February 2003|volume=299|pages=877–881|bibcode = 2003Sci...299..877H |doi = 10.1126/science.1078766|pmid=12574626}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory was suggested for the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] on the sudden decrease of carbon isotopic composition of global inorganic carbon pool by 2.5 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higgins|first=John A.|author2=Daniel P. Schrag|title=Beyond Methane: Towards a theory for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|year=2006|volume=245|pages=523–537|bibcode = 2006E&amp;PSL.245..523H |doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2006.03.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothesis noted for this negative drop of isotopes could be the increase of [[methane hydrate]]s, the trigger for which remains a mystery. This increase of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]], which happens to be a potent, but short-lived greenhouse gas, increased the global temperatures by 6&amp;nbsp;°C with the assistance of the less potent carbon dioxide.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==List of Icehouse and Greenhouse Periods==

* A greenhouse period ran from 4.6 to 2.4 billion years ago.
* [[Huronian|Huronian Glaciation]] - an icehouse period that ran from 2.4 billion years ago to 2.1 billion years ago
* A greenhouse period ran from 2.1 billion to 720 million years ago.
* [[Cryogenian]] - an icehouse period that ran from 720 to 635 million years ago, at times the entire Earth was frozen over
* A greenhouse period ran from 635 million years ago to 450 million years ago.
* [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] - an icehouse period that ran from 450 to 420 million years ago
* A greenhouse period ran from 420 million years ago to 360 million years ago.
* [[Karoo Ice Age|Late Paleozoic Ice Age]] - an icehouse period that ran from 360 to 260 million years ago
* A greenhouse period ran from 260 million years ago to 33.9 million years ago
* [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age]] - the current icehouse period which began 33.9 million years ago

==Modern conditions==
Currently, the Earth is in an icehouse climate state. About 34 million years ago, ice sheets began to form in [[Antarctica]]; the ice sheets in the [[Arctic]] did not start forming until 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27" /&gt; Some processes that may have led to our current icehouse may be connected to the development of the Himalayan Mountains and the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between [[South America]] and Antarctica.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Scientists have been attempting to compare the past transitions between icehouse and greenhouse, and vice versa to understand where our planet is now heading.

Without the human influence on the greenhouse gas concentration, the Earth would be heading toward a [[ice age|glacial]] period. Predicted changes in [[orbital forcing]] suggest that in absence of human-made [[global warming]] the next glacial period would begin at least 50,000 years from now&lt;ref name=BergerLoutre&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berger A, Loutre MF |title=Climate. An exceptionally long interglacial ahead? |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5585 |pages=1287–8 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12193773 |doi=10.1126/science.1076120 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5585/1287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]).

But due to the ongoing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth is instead heading toward a greenhouse Earth period.&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27" /&gt; Permanent ice is actually a rare phenomenon in the history of the Earth, occurring only in coincidence with the icehouse effect, which has affected about 20% of Earth's history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">'''Hard inheritance''' was a model of [[heredity]] that explicitly excludes any acquired characteristics, such as of [[Lamarckism]]. It is the exact opposite of [[soft inheritance]], coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] to contrast ideas about [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]].

Hard inheritance states that characteristics of an organism's offspring (passed on through [[DNA]]) will not be affected by the actions that the [[parental]] [[organism]] performs during its lifetime. For example: a medieval [[blacksmith]] who uses only his right arm to [[forge]] [[steel]] will not sire a son with a stronger right arm than left because the blacksmith's actions do not alter his genetic code. Inheritance due to usage and non-usage is excluded. Inheritance works as described in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis of evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1980). Provine, William B.; Mayr, Ernst. ed.

The '''''Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi''''' ([[French language|French]] for ''Natural History, General and Particular, with a Description of the King's Cabinet'') is an encyclopaedic collection of 36 large (quarto) volumes written between 1749–1804 by the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], and continued in eight more volumes after his death by his colleagues, led by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]]. The books cover what was known of the "natural sciences" at the time, including what would now be called [[material science]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[technology]] as well as the [[natural history]] of animals.

== ''Histoire Naturelle'', an encyclopaedic work ==
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788) made the ''Histoire Naturelle'' his life's work.]]

The ''Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi'' is the work that the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788) is remembered for. He worked on it for some 50 years, initially at [[Montbard]] in his office in the Tour Saint-Louis, then in his library at Petit Fontenet. 36 volumes came out between 1749 and 1789, followed by 8 more after his death, thanks to [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]]. It includes all the knowledge available in his time on the "natural sciences", a broad term that includes disciplines which today would be called material science, physics, chemistry and technology. Buffon notes the morphological similarities between men and apes, although he considered apes completely devoid of the ability to think, differentiating them sharply from human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Buffon, "Nomenclature des Singes ", in ''Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi'', Tome Quatorzième ("Histoire Naturelle des Quadrupèdes" XI), Imprimerie royale, Paris, 1766.&lt;/ref&gt; Buffon's attention to internal anatomy made him an early [[comparative anatomist]]. "L’intérieur, dans les êtres vivants, est le fond du dessin de la nature", he wrote in his ''Quadrupèdes,'' "the interior, in living things, is the foundation of nature's design."&lt;ref&gt;Buffon, "L'Unau et l'Aï", in ''Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi'', Tome Treizième ("Histoire Naturelle des Quadrupèdes" X), Imprimerie royale, Paris, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Histoire Naturelle'', which was meant to address the whole of natural history, actually covers only [[minerals]], [[birds]], and the [[quadrupeds]] among animals. It is accompanied by some discourses and a theory of the earth by way of introduction, and by supplements including an elegantly written account of the epochs of nature.

The ''Suppléments'' cover a wide range of topics; for example, in (Suppléments IV), there is a ''Discours sur le style'' (Discourse on Style) and an ''Essai d'arithmétique morale'' (essay on Moral Arithmetic).

[[Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton]] assisted Buffon on the quadrupeds; [[Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard]] worked on the birds. They were joined, from 1767, by [[Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond]], the abbot Gabriel Bexon and [[Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt]]. The whole descriptive and anatomical part of ''l’Histoire des Quadrupèdes'' was the work of [[Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton|Daubenton]] and Jean-Claude Mertrud.

[[File:Lynx-Georges-Louis Leclerc Buffon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lynx]] in Volume IX, by [[Jacques de Sève]]]]
Buffon attached much importance to the illustrations; [[Jacques de Sève]] illustrated the quadrupeds and [[François-Nicolas Martinet]] illustrated the birds. Nearly 2000 plates adorn the work, representing animals with care given both to [[aesthetics]] and [[anatomy|anatomical]] accuracy, with dreamlike and [[mythology|mythological]] settings.

On minerals, Buffon collaborated with [[André Thouin]]. [[Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond]] and [[Louis-Bernard Guyton-Morveau|Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] provided sources for the mineral volumes.

L’''Histoire Naturelle'' met immense success, almost as great as ''[[Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers|Encyclopédie]]'' by [[Diderot]], which came out in the same period. The first three volumes of ''L’Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la description du cabinet du Roi'' were reprinted three times in six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Roger, Jacques. ''Buffon, un philosophe au Jardin du Roi'', Fayard, Paris, 1989, 645 p. {{ISBN|2-213-02265-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopaedia appeared in 36 volumes :
* 3 volumes in 1749 : ''De la manière d’étudier l’histoire naturelle'' followed by ''Théorie de la Terre'', ''Histoire Générale des animaux'' and ''Histoire Naturelle de l’homme'' 
* 12 volumes on quadrupeds (1753 to 1767)
* 9 volumes on birds (1770 to 1783])
* 5 volumes on minerals (1783 to 1788), the last including ''Traité de l’aimant'', the last work published by Buffon in his lifetime
* 7 volumes of supplements (1774 to 1789), including ''Époques de la nature'' (from 1778).

''L’Histoire Naturelle'' was initially printed at the [[Imprimerie nationale|Imprimerie royale]] in 36 volumes (1749–1789). In 1764 Buffon bought back the rights to his work. It was continued by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]], who described the [[reptiles|egg-laying quadrupeds]], [[snakes]], [[fishes]] and [[cetaceans]] in 8 volumes (1788–1804).

Buffon was assisted in the work by Jacques-François Artur (1708–1779), Gabriel Léopold Charles Amé Bexon (1748–1785), Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton (1716–1799), [[Edme-Louis Daubenton]] (1732–1786), [[Jacques de Sève]] ([[floruit|actif]] 1742–1788), [[Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond]] (1741–1819), Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard (1720–1785), [[Louis-Bernard Guyton-Morveau]] (1737–1816), Bernard Germain de Lacépède (1756–1825), [[François-Nicolas Martinet]] (1731–1800), the anatomist [[Jean-Claude Mertrud]] (1728–1802), [[Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt]] (1751–1812), and [[André Thouin]] (1747–1823).

== Approach ==
[[File:Pinson de neige - Buffon.jpeg|thumb|Spread of [[quarto]] pages, with decorative tail-piece illustration (1779)]]

Each group is introduced with a general essay. This is followed by an article, sometimes of many pages, on each animal (or other item). The article on the [[wolf]] begins with the claim that it is one of the animals with a specially strong appetite for flesh; it asserts that the animal is naturally coarse and cowardly (''grossier et poltron''), but becoming crafty at need, and hardy by necessity, driven by hunger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97496g/f44.zoom ''Le Loup''] Volume VII. p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The language, as in this instance, is elegant and elaborate, even "flowery and ornate".&lt;ref name=Huxley/&gt; Buffon was roundly criticised by his fellow academics for writing a "purely popularizing work, empty and puffed up, with little real scientific value".&lt;ref name=Huxley/&gt;

The species is named in Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, German, English, Swedish, and Polish. The zoological descriptions of the species by [[Conrad Gessner|Gessner]], [[John Ray|Ray]], [[Linnaeus]], [[Jacob Theodor Klein|Klein]] and Buffon himself ("''Canis ex griseo flavescens. Lupus vulgaris''. Buffon. ''Reg. animal. pag. 235''") are cited.

The text is written as a continuous essay, without the sections on identification, distribution and behaviour that might have been expected from other natural histories. Parts concern human responses rather than the animal itself, as for example that the wolf likes human flesh, and the strongest wolves sometimes eat nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97496g/f53.zoom ''Le Loup''] Volume VII. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements may be included; in the case of the wolf, 41 separate measurements are tabulated, in pre-revolutionary French feet and inches{{efn|[[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution|The pre-revolutionary units of measurement ''pieds'' (feet) and ''pouces'' (inches)]] were slightly (1.066×) larger than the equivalent British feet and inches.}} starting with the "Length of the whole body measured in a straight line from the end of the muzzle to the anus........3 feet. 7 inches." (1.2&amp;nbsp;m); the "Length of the largest claws" is given as "10 lines" (2.2&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97496g/f62.zoom ''Le Loup''] Volume VII. pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

The wolf is illustrated standing in farmland, and as a complete skeleton standing on a stone plinth in a landscape. The account of the species occupies 32 pages including illustrations.

== Editions ==

=== Buffon's original edition continued by Lacépède ===
[[File:B G de Lacépède.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]] (1756–1825) continued the ''Histoire Naturelle'' after Buffon's death.]]
The original edition of the ''Histoire Naturelle'' by Buffon comprised 36 volumes in quarto, divided into the following series: Histoire de la Terre et de l'Homme, Quadrupèdes, Oiseaux, Minéraux, Suppléments. Buffon edited 35 volumes in his lifetime. Soon after his death, the fifth and final volume of ''l’Histoire des minéraux'' appeared in 1788 at the ''Imprimerie des Bâtiments du Roi''. The seventh and final volume of ''Suppléments'' by Buffon was published posthumously in 1789 through Lacépède's hands. Lacépède continued the part of the ''Histoire Naturelle'' which dealt with animals. A few months before Buffon's death, en 1788, Lacépède published, as a continuation, the first volume of his ''Histoire des Reptiles'', on egg-laying quadrupeds. The next year, he wrote a second volume on snakes, published during the [[French Revolution]]. Between 1798 and 1803, he brought out the volume ''Histoire des Poissons''. Lacépède made use of the notes and collections left by [[Philibert Commerson]] (1727–1773). He wrote ''Histoire des Cétacés'' which was printed in 1804. At that point, the ''Histoire Naturelle'', by Buffon and Lacépède, thus contained 44 quarto volumes forming the definitive edition.&lt;ref name=wit&gt;Hendrik Cornelius Dirk De Wit, ''Histoire du Développement de la Biologie'', Volume III, Presses Polytechniques et Universitaires Romandes, Lausanne, 1994, pp. 101–110. {{ISBN|2-88074-264-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variations in the editions by Buffon and Lacépède ===

Another edition in quarto format was printed by the ''Imprimerie royale'' in 36 volumes (1774–1804). It consisted of 28 volumes par Buffon, and 8 volumes by Lacépède. The part containing anatomical articles by Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton was dropped. The supplements were merged into the relevant articles in the main volumes.

The ''Imprimerie royale'' also published two editions of the ''Histoire Naturelle'' in duodecimo format (1752–1805), occupying 90 or 71 volumes, depending on whether or not they included the part on anatomy. In this print format, the original work by Buffon occupied 73 volumes  with the part on anatomy, or 54 volumes without the part on anatomy. The continuation by Lacépède took up 17 duodecimo volumes.

A de luxe edition of ''Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux'' (Birds) (1771–1786) was produced by the ''Imprimerie royale'' in 10 folio and quarto volumes, with 1008 engraved and hand-coloured plates, executed under Buffon's personal supervision by [[Edme-Louis Daubenton]], cousin and brother-in-law of Buffon's principal collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu]], ''Sixième Notice historique sur le Muséum'', Annales du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle, Tome Onzième, Tourneisen Fils libraire, Paris, 1808, p.1-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early translations were necessarily only of the earlier volumes. Given the complexity, all catalogue dates other than of single volumes should be taken as approximate.

R. Griffith published an early translation of the volume on ''The Horse'' in London in 1762. T. Bell published a translation of the first six volumes in London between 1775 and 1776.

==Reception==

===Contemporary===
[[File:Nashorn.buffon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indian rhinoceros]] (1767)]]

The ''Histoire Naturelle'' had a distinctly mixed reception in the eighteenth century. Wealthy homes in both England and France purchased copies, and the first edition was sold out within six weeks.&lt;ref name=Huxley/&gt; But Buffon was criticised by some priests for suggesting (in the essay ''Les Epoques de Nature'', Volume XXXIV)&lt;ref name=Huxley/&gt; that the earth was more than 6,000 years old and that mountains had arisen in geological time. Buffon cites as evidence that fossil sea-shells had been found at the tops of mountains;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=McQueen, Rod |title=Rocks of Ages |url=http://www.dawntoduskpublications.com/html/rocks_ages_chapter.htm |publisher=Dawn to Dusk |accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the claim was seen as contradicting the biblical account in the [[Book of Genesis]]. Buffon also disagreed with [[Linnaeus]]'s [[Linnaean taxonomy|system of classifying plants]] as described in ''Systema Naturae'' (1735). In Buffon's view, expounded in the "Premier Discours" of the ''Histoire Naturelle'' (1749), the concept of species was entirely artificial, the only real entity in nature being the individual; as for a taxonomy based on the number of [[stamen]]s or [[pistil]]s in a flower, mere counting (despite Buffon's own training in mathematics) had no bearing on nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Frängsmyr, Tore |author2=Heilbron, J.L. |author3=Rider, Robin E. |title=The Quantifying Spirit in the 18th Century| chapter=The Broken Circle. The Challenge of Plenitude | year=1990 |url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6d5nb455&amp;chunk.id=d0e2314&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;brand=ucpress |publisher=University of California Press |accessdate=24 December 2014 | pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paris faculty of theology, acting as the official censor, wrote to Buffon with a list of statements in the ''Histoire Naturelle'' that were contradictory to [[Roman Catholic]] Church teaching. Hypocritically, Buffon replied that he believed firmly in the biblical account of creation, and was able to continue printing his book, and remain in position as the leader of the 'old school', complete with his job as director of the royal botanical garden. On Buffon's death, the 19-year-old [[Georges Cuvier]] celebrated with the words "This time, the Comte de Buffon is dead and buried". Soon afterwards, the [[French revolution]] went much further in sweeping away old attitudes to natural history, along with much else.&lt;ref name="Huxley"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Knapp, Sandra |authorlink1=Comte de Buffon |editor1-last=Huxley |editor1-first=Robert |title=The Great Naturalists |publisher=Thames and Hudson |pages=140–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
[[File:Hippo.buffon.jpg|thumb|upright|Newborn [[hippopotamus]] (1767)]]

==== Philosophy ====
The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] calls the ''Histoire Naturelle'' "Buffon's major work", observing that "In addressing the history of the earth, Buffon also broke with the 'counter-factual' tradition of Descartes, and presented a secular and realist account of the origins of the earth and its life forms."&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Concept of Evolution to 1872 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolution-to-1872/#2.4 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |date=3 June 2014 |origyear=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its view, the work created an "age of Buffon", defining what natural history itself was, while Buffon's "Discourse on Method" (unlike that of [[Descartes]]) at the start of the work argued that repeated observation could lead to a greater certainty of knowledge even than "mathematical analysis of nature".&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; Buffon also led natural history away from the [[natural theology]] of British [[parson-naturalist]]s such as [[John Ray]]. He thus offered both a new methodology and an empirical style of enquiry.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt; Buffon's position on [[evolution]] is complex; he noted in Volume 4 from Daubenton's comparative anatomy of the [[horse]] and the [[donkey]] that species might "transform", but initially (1753) rejected the possibility. However, in doing so he changed the definition of a [[species]] from a fixed or universal class (which could not change, by definition) to "the historical succession of ancestor and descendant linked by material connection through generation", identified by the ability to mate and produce fertile offspring. Thus the horse and donkey, which produce only sterile hybrids, are seen empirically not to be the same species, even though they have similar anatomy. That empirical fact leaves open the possibility of evolution.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt;

==== Style ====

The botanist Sandra Knapp writes that "Buffon's prose was so [[Purple prose|purple]] that the ideas themselves are almost hidden",&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt; observing that this was also the contemporary academic opinion. She notes that some quite radical ideas are to be found in his work, but they are almost invisible, given the language they are cloaked in. She quotes Buffon's dramatic description of the lion, which along with the engraving in her view "emphasized both the lion's regal bearing and personality not only in his text but also in the illustration... A reader was left in no doubt as to the importance and character of the animal."&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt; She concludes "No wonder the cultured [[aristocratic]] public lapped it up – the text reads more like a [[romantic novel]] than a dry scientific treatise".&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt;

==== Evolutionary thought ====

The [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Ernst Mayr]] comments that "In this monumental and fascinating ''Histoire naturelle'', Buffon dealt in a stimulating manner with almost all the problems that would subsequently be raised by evolutionists. Written in a brilliant style, this work was read in French or in one of the numerous translations by every educated person in Europe".&lt;ref name="Mayr"&gt;{{cite book | author=Mayr, Ernst | year=1981 | title=The Growth of Biological Thought | publisher=Harvard | pages=329–337 | url=http://google.co.uk/books?id=pHThtE2R0UQC&amp;pg=PA330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr argued that "virtually all the well-known writers of the Enlightenment"&lt;ref name="Mayr"/&gt; were "Buffonians", and calls Buffon "the father of all thought in [[natural history]] in the second half of the eighteenth century".&lt;ref name="Mayr"/&gt;

Mayr notes that Buffon was not an "evolutionist", but was certainly responsible for creating the great amount of interest in natural history in France.&lt;ref name="Mayr" /&gt; He agrees that Buffon's thought is hard to classify and even self-contradictory, and that the [[theologians]] forced him to avoid writing some of his opinions openly. Mayr argues however that Buffon was "fully aware of the possibility of 'common descent', and was perhaps the first author ever to articulate it clearly",&lt;ref name="Mayr" /&gt; quoting Buffon at length, starting with "Not only the ass and the horse, but also man, the apes, the quadrupeds, and all the animals might be regarded as constituting but a single family",&lt;ref name="Mayr" /&gt; and later "that man and ape have a common origin", and that "the power of nature...with sufficient time, she has been able from a single being to derive all the other organized beings". Mayr notes, however, that Buffon immediately rejects the suggestion and offers three arguments against it, namely that no new species have arisen in historical times; that [[hybrid infertility]] firmly separates species; and that animals intermediate between, say, the horse and the donkey are not seen (in the [[fossil record]]).&lt;ref name="Mayr" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">The '''International Early Warning Program''' ('''IEWP'''), was first proposed at the Second International Early Warning Conference (EWCII) in 2003 in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]]. It developed increasing importance in the wake of the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], which claimed over 200,000 lives and injured over half a million people. 

==History==

In January 2005, the [[United Nations]] (UN) launched extensive plans to create a global warning system to lessen the impact of deadly natural disasters at the [[World Conference on Disaster Reduction]], held in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The UN programme would help improve [[hazard prevention|prevention]] and resilience to all types of [[natural disaster]]s, including [[droughts]], [[wildfires]], [[floods]], [[typhoons]], [[hurricanes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanoes]] and [[tsunamis]], by using a comprehensive set of methods including rapid information sharing and training communities at risk. It is believed that the loss of human life would have been dramatically reduced, if a [[tsunami warning system]], like the one that exists for the volcano-and-earthquake prone [[Pacific Rim]], had been operational in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Technology, such as tremor and tidal gauges, fast data transfer and alarm mechanisms, used in combination with training in the danger zones, would have given hundreds of thousands of people time to move to the safety of higher ground. 

Early warning systems are now widely recognized as worthwhile and necessary investments to help save lives. In 2004, millions of people in the Americas and Asia were evacuated when tropical storms struck, which saved thousands of lives. According to Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of the [[World Meteorological Organisation]], about 90% of all natural disasters were caused by hazards related to weather and water. Speaking at the conference, he said: "It is WMO's aim to halve the number of deaths due to natural disasters of meteorological, hydrological and climatic origin over the next 15 years, more specifically to reduce by half the associated ten-year average fatality from the period 1995-2004 to the period 2010-2019 for these disasters."[http://www.unisdr.org/wcdr/intergover/observer/wmo.pdf]

There was unanimous support among participants to the January 2005 conference, as an initial step towards an International Early Warning Programme, for UN-led efforts to establish an [[Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20081121140804/http://www.crisscross.com/jp/comment/715]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2283">The '''Jaramillo reversal''' was a [[Geomagnetic reversal|reversal]] and [[Geomagnetic excursion|excursion]] of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] that occurred approximately one million years ago. In the geological time scale it was a "short-term" positive reversal in the then-dominant Matuyama reversed magnetic chronozone; its beginning is widely dated to 990,000 years before the present ([[Before Present|BP]]), and its end to 950,000 BP (though an alternative date of 1.07 million years ago to 990,000 is also found in the scientific literature).&lt;ref&gt;Herrero-Bervera, Emilio, and S. Keith Runcorn. "Transition Fields during the Geomagnetic Reversals and Their Geodynamic Significance." ''Philosophical Transactions: Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences,'' Vol. 355 No. 1730 (September 15, 1997), pp. 1713–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes and mechanisms of short-term reversals and excursions like the Jaramillo, as well as the major field reversals like the [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal]], are subjects of study and dispute among researchers.

In [[physics]], the '''Kondo effect''' describes the scattering of conduction [[Conduction electrons|electrons]] in a metal due to magnetic impurities, resulting in a characteristic change in [[electrical resistivity]] with temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Alex C |last=Hewson |author2=[[Jun Kondo]]  |date=2009 |title=Kondo effect |journal=Scholarpedia |volume=4 |number=3 |page=7529 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.7529 |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Kondo_effect |accessdate=2009-12-18|bibcode=2009SchpJ...4.7529H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effect was first described by [[Jun Kondo]], who applied third-order [[perturbation theory]] to the problem to account for s-d electron scattering. Kondo's model predicted that the scattering rate of conduction electrons of the magnetic impurity should diverge as the temperature approaches 0 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1143/PTP.32.37|title=Resistance Minimum in Dilute Magnetic Alloys|date=1964|last1=Kondo|first1=Jun|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–49|bibcode = 1964PThPh..32...37K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extended to a lattice of ''magnetic impurities'', the Kondo effect likely explains the formation of [[heavy fermion|''heavy fermions'']] and [[Kondo insulator|''Kondo insulators'']] in intermetallic compounds, especially those involving rare earth elements like [[cerium]], [[praseodymium]], and [[ytterbium]], and actinide elements like [[uranium]]. The Kondo effect has also been observed in [[quantum dot]] systems.

==Theory==
The temperature dependence of the resistivity including the Kondo effect is written as:

&lt;math&gt;\rho(T) = \rho_0 + aT^2 + c_m \ln\frac{\mu}{T} + bT^5,&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the residual resistance, aT&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; shows the contribution from the Fermi liquid properties, and the term bT&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; is from the lattice vibrations; a, b and c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are constants. Jun Kondo derived the third term of the logarithmic dependence.

==Background==
Kondo's model was derived using perturbation theory, but later methods used non-perturbative techniques to refine his result. These improvements produced a finite resistivity but retained the feature of a resistance minimum at a non-zero temperature. One defines the '''Kondo temperature''' as the energy scale limiting the validity of the Kondo results. The [[Anderson impurity model]] and accompanying [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Wilsonian]] [[renormalization]] theory were an important contribution to understanding the underlying physics of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.124.41|url=http://cos.cumt.edu.cn/jpkc/dxwl/zl/zl1/Physical%20Review%20Classics/condensed/061.pdf|title=Localized Magnetic States in Metals|date=1961|last1=Anderson|first1=P.|journal=Physical Review|volume=124|issue=1|pages=41–53|bibcode=1961PhRv..124...41A}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Schrieffer-Wolff transformation]], it was shown that Kondo model lies in the strong coupling regime of the Anderson impurity model. The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrieffer, J.R.|author2=Wolff, P.A. |title=Relation between the Anderson and Kondo Hamiltonians|journal=Physical Review|date=September 1966|volume=149|issue=2|pages=491–492|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.149.491|bibcode = 1966PhRv..149..491S }}&lt;/ref&gt; projects out the high energy charge excitations in Anderson impurity model, obtaining the Kondo model as an effective Hamiltonian.

[[Image:kscheme.jpg|thumb|320px|Schematic of the weakly coupled high temperature situation in which the magnetic moments of conduction electrons in the metal host pass by the impurity magnetic moment at speeds of v&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, the Fermi velocity, experiencing only a mild antiferromagnetic correlation in the vicinity of the impurity. In contrast, as the temperature tends to zero the impurity magnetic moment and one conduction electron moment bind very strongly to form an overall non-magnetic state.]]

The Kondo effect can be considered as an example of [[asymptotic freedom]], i.e. a situation where the coupling becomes non-perturbatively strong at low temperatures and low energies. In the Kondo problem, the coupling refers to the interaction between the localized magnetic impurities and the itinerant electrons.

Extended to a lattice of ''magnetic impurities'', the Kondo effect likely explains the formation of [[heavy fermion|''heavy fermions'']] and [[Kondo insulator|''Kondo insulators'']] in intermetallic compounds, especially those involving rare earth elements like [[cerium]], [[praseodymium]], and [[ytterbium]], and actinide elements like [[uranium]]. In [[heavy fermion]] materials, the nonperturbative growth of the interaction leads to quasi-electrons with masses up to thousands of times the free electron mass, i.e., the electrons are dramatically slowed by the interactions. In a number of instances they actually are [[superconductors]]. More recently, it is believed that a manifestation of the Kondo effect is necessary for understanding the unusual metallic delta-phase of [[plutonium]].

More recently the Kondo effect has been observed in [[quantum dot]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.281.5376.540|first=Sara M.|last=Cronenwett|date=1998 |title=A Tunable Kondo Effect in Quantum Dots|journal=Science|volume=281|number=5376|pages=540–544|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/281/5376/540.abstract|arxiv = cond-mat/9804211 |bibcode = 1998Sci...281..540C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Revival of the Kondo|url=http://kouwenhovenlab.tudelft.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/97-revival-of-the-kondo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such systems, a quantum dot with at least one unpaired electron behaves as a magnetic impurity, and when the dot is coupled to a metallic conduction band, the conduction electrons can scatter off the dot. This is completely analogous to the more traditional case of a magnetic impurity in a metal.

In 2012, Beri and Cooper proposed a topological Kondo effect could be found with [[Majorana fermion]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Béri|first=B.|last2=Cooper|first2=N. R.|year=1568|title=Topological Kondo Effect with Majorana Fermions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=109|issue=15|pages=156803|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.156803|pmid=23102351|arxiv=1206.2224|bibcode=2012PhRvL.109o6803B}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it has been shown that [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulations]] with [[ultracold atom]]s may also demonstrate the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buccheri|first=F.|last2=Bruce|first2=G. D.|last3=Trombettoni|first3=A.|last4=Cassettari|first4=D.|last5=Babujian|first5=H.|last6=Korepin|first6=V.

In 2017, teams from the Vienna University of Technology and Rice University conducted experiments into the development of new materials and theoretical work experimenting with structures made from the metals cerium, bismuth and palladium in specific combinations, respectively. The results of these experiments were published in December 2017, and contributed to theoretical work being undertaken by Dr. Hsin-Hua Lai and his team at Rice University, who realized the potential to create an entirely new material. They "stumbled upon" a model, and found that "the mass had gone from like 1,000 times the mass of an electron to zero".&lt;ref&gt;Gabbatiss, J. (2017) [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/quantum-material-physics-weyl-kondo-semimetal-vienna-university-technology-a8121141.html "Scientists discover entirely new material that cannot be explained by classical physics"], ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; This is a characteristic of a [[Weyl semimetal]]. The team dubbed this new [[quantum material]] Weyl-Kondo [[semimetal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lai|first=H.H.|last2=Grefe|first2=S.E.|last3=Paschen|first3=S.|last4=Si|first4=Q.|year=1568|title=Weyl–Kondo semimetal in heavy-fermion systems|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/12/1715851115.full|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=115|issue=1|pages=93-97|doi=10.1073/pnas.1715851115|pmid=29255021|pmc=5776817|arxiv=1206.2224|bibcode=2018PNAS..115...93L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kunstformen der Natur''''' (known in English as '''''Art Forms in Nature'''''&lt;!--boldface for redirect target--&gt;) is a book of [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[halftone]] prints by German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]].

==Publication==

Originally published in sets of ten between 1899 and 1904 and collectively in two volumes in 1904,&lt;ref name="KreinikArts2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Juliana D. Kreinik |author2=New York University. Institute of Fine Arts |title=The Canvas and the Camera in Weimar Germany: A New Objectivity in Painting and Photography of the 1920s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khRzA67DzkgC&amp;pg=PA232 |year=2008 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |isbn=978-0-549-58248-9 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; it consists of 100 prints of various organisms, many of which were first described by Haeckel himself.  Over the course of his career, over 1000 [[engraving]]s were produced based on Haeckel's [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es and [[watercolor]]s; many of the best of these were chosen for ''Kunstformen der Natur'', translated from sketch to print by lithographer Adolf Giltsch.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition of ''Kunstformen'', containing only 30 prints, was produced in 1924.

==Themes==

According to Haeckel scholar Olaf Breidbach, the work was "not just a book of illustrations but also the summation of his view of the world."  The over-riding themes of the ''Kunstformen'' plates are [[symmetry in biology|symmetry]] and [[Evolution of biological complexity|level of organization&lt;!--in evolution, not molecule/cell/tissue/organ level--&gt;]].  The subjects were selected to embody these to the full, from the scale patterns of [[boxfish]]es to the spirals of [[ammonite]]s to the perfect symmetries of jellies and microorganisms, while images composing each plate are arranged for maximum visual impact.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', pp. 229-231&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the notable prints are numerous [[radiolarian]]s, which Haeckel helped to popularize among amateur [[microscope|microscopists]]; at least one example is found in almost every set of 10.  [[Cnidaria]] also feature prominently throughout the book, including [[sea anemones]] as well as [[Siphonophorae]], [[Semaeostomeae]], and other [[medusa (biology)|medusae]].  The first set included ''Desmonema annasethe'' (now ''[[Cyanea (jellyfish)|Cyanea]] annasethe''), a particularly striking [[jellyfish]] that Haeckel observed and described shortly after the death of his wife Anna Sethe.&lt;ref name=Innes&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Innes |first1=Shelley |title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith, Religion, Theology, and Natural Science, Vol. 3 by Mario di Gregorio |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2006 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=214–216 | doi = 10.1007/s10739-006-0001-9 |jstor=4332000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

''Kunstformen der Natur'' was influential in early 20th-century art, architecture, and design, bridging the gap between science and art.  In particular, many artists associated with [[Art Nouveau]] were influenced by Haeckel's images, including [[René Binet (artist)|René Binet]], [[Karl Blossfeldt]], [[Hans Christiansen (artist)|Hans Christiansen]], and [[Émile Gallé]].  One prominent example is the [[Beurs van Berlage|Amsterdam Commodities Exchange]] designed by [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]]: it was in part inspired by ''Kunstformen'' illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', pp. 231, 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[glacier]]''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ɡ|l|eɪ|ʃ|ər}} {{respell|GLAY|shər}}) or ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|s|i|ə}}) is a persistent body of dense [[ice]] that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of [[snow]] exceeds its [[ablation]] (melting and [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]) over many years, often [[centuries]]. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating [[crevasse]]s, [[serac]]s, and other distinguishing features. Because glacial mass is affected by long-term [[climate]] changes, e.g., [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[temperature|mean temperature]], and [[cloud cover]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacial mass change]]s are considered among the most sensitive indicators of [[climate change]].

===Antarctica===

{{main|List of glaciers in the Antarctic}}

There are many glaciers in the Antarctic. This set of lists does not include [[ice sheet]]s, [[ice cap]]s or [[ice field]]s, such as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], but includes [[Glacier|glacial]] features that are defined by their flow, rather than general bodies of ice. The lists include [[Glacier morphology#Outlet glaciers|outlet glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Valley glaciers|valley glaciers]], [[Glacier morphology#Cirque glaciers|cirque glaciers]], [[Glacier#Types of glaciers|tidewater glaciers]] and [[ice stream]]s. Ice streams are a type of glacier&lt;ref name="NSIDC" /&gt; and many of them have "glacier" in their name, e.g. [[Pine Island Glacier]]. [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] are listed separately in the [[List of Antarctic ice shelves]]. For the purposes of these lists, the [[Antarctic]] is defined as any [[latitude]] further south than 60° (the continental limit according to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]).&lt;ref name="nbTreatyText" /&gt;

There are also glaciers in the subantarctic. This includes one [[snow field]] ([[Murray Snowfield]]). Snow fields are not glaciers in the strict sense of the word, but they are commonly found at the [[accumulation zone]] or head of a glacier.&lt;ref name=nsidc&gt;{{cite web

The majority of Europe's glaciers are found in the Alps, Caucasus and the Scandinavian Mountains (mostly Norway) as well as in Iceland. Iceland has the largest glacier in Europe, [[Vatnajökull]] glacier, that covers between 8,100-8,300&amp;nbsp;km² in area and 3,100&amp;nbsp;km³ in volume. Norway alone has more than 2500 glaciers (including very small ones) covering an estimated 1% of mainland Norway's surface area. Several of mainland Europe's biggest glaciers are found here including; [[Jostedal Glacier|Jostedalsbreen]](the largest in mainland Europe at 487&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Svartisen|Vestre Svartisen]](221&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Søndre Folgefonna]](168&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Svartisen|Østre Svartisen]](148&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

{{maincat|Glaciers of North America}}
There are a number of glaciers existing in North America, currently or in recent centuries. In the United States, these [[glacier]]s are located in nine states, all in the Rocky Mountains or further west. The southernmost named glacier among them is the [[Lilliput Glacier]] in [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]], east of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of California.

[[Mexico]] has about two dozen glaciers, all of which are located on [[Pico de Orizaba]] (Citlaltépetl), [[Popocatépetl]] and [[Iztaccíhuatl]], the three tallest mountains in the country.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Sidney E.|title=Glaciers of Mexico|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|work=Glaciers of North America|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=July 8, 2012|format=pdf|date=2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017213832/http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386j/mexico/mexico-lores.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{main|List of glaciers in South America}}
[[File:Chimborazo.jpg|thumb|[[Chimborazo]]]]
Glaciers in South America develop exclusively on the [[Andes]] and are subject of the Andes various climatic regimes namely the [[Tropical Andes]], [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]]. Apart from this there is a wide range of latitudes on which glaciers develop from 5000 m in the [[Altiplano]] [[mountains]] and [[volcanoes]] to reaching sealevel as tidewater glaciers from [[San Rafael Lagoon]] (45° S) and southwards. South America hosts two large [[ice field]]s, the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s, of which the second is the largest contiguous body of glaciers in extrapolar regions.

The '''glaciers of Chile''' cover 2.7% (20,188&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conama.cl/portal/1301/articles-43721_recurso_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210108/http://www.conama.cl/portal/1301/articles-43721_recurso_1.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the land area of the country, excluding [[Antártica Chilena]], and have a considerable impact on its landscape and water supply. By surface 80% of South America’s glaciers lie in Chile. Glaciers develop in the [[Andes]] of Chile from 27˚S southwards and in a very few places north of 18°30'S in the extreme north of the country:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf Climate change and tropical Andean glaciers: Past, present and future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106032056/http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf |date=2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in between they are absent because of extreme aridity, though [[rock glacier]]s formed from [[permafrost]] are common. The largest glaciers of Chile are the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s. From a latitude of 47° S and south some glaciers reach sea level.

Apart from height and latitude, the settings of Chilean glaciers depend on precipitation patterns; in this sense two different regions exist: the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13378">{{Distinguish|Vacuum manifold}}

'''Manifold vacuum''', or '''engine vacuum''' in an [[internal combustion engine]] is the difference in air pressure between the engine's [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] and [[Earth's atmosphere]].

Manifold [[vacuum]] is an effect of a [[piston]]'s movement on the [[Stroke (engine)#Induction stroke|induction stroke]] and the [[choked flow]] through a [[throttle]] in the intake manifold of an engine. It is a measure of the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the manifold vacuum is also used as an [[Automobile ancillary power|auxiliary power source]] to drive engine accessories and for the [[crankcase ventilation system]].

Manifold vacuum should not be confused with [[venturi effect|venturi vacuum]], which is an effect exploited in [[carburetor]]s to establish a pressure difference roughly proportional to mass airflow and to maintain a somewhat constant [[air/fuel ratio]]. It is also used in light airplanes to provide airflow for pneumatic gyroscopic instruments.

==Overview==
The rate of airflow through an internal combustion engine is an important factor determining the amount of power the engine generates. Most gasoline engines are controlled by limiting that flow with a [[throttle]] that restricts intake airflow, while a [[diesel engine]] is controlled by the amount of fuel supplied to the cylinder, and so has no "throttle" as such. Manifold vacuum is present in all [[naturally aspirated engine]]s that use throttles (including [[carburetor|carbureted]] and [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] [[gasoline engine]]s using the [[Otto cycle]] or the [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] cycle; [[diesel engine]]s do not have throttle plates).

The [[mass flow]] through the engine is the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the rotation rate of the engine, the [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of the engine, and the density of the intake stream in the intake manifold. In most applications the rotation rate is set by the application (engine speed in a [[vehicle]] or machinery speed in other applications). The displacement is dependent on the engine geometry, which is generally not adjustable while the engine is in use (although a handful of models do have this feature, see [[variable displacement]]). Restricting the input flow reduces the density (and hence pressure) in the intake manifold, reducing the amount of power produced. It is also a major source of engine drag (see [[engine braking]]), as the engine must pump material from the low-pressure intake manifold into the exhaust manifold (at ambient atmospheric pressure).

When the throttle is opened (in a car, the [[Car controls#Pedals|accelerator pedal]] is depressed), ambient air is free to fill the intake manifold, increasing the pressure (filling the vacuum). A [[carburetor]] or [[fuel injection]] system adds fuel to the airflow in the correct proportion, providing energy to the engine. When the throttle is opened all the way, the engine's air induction system is exposed to full atmospheric pressure, and maximum airflow through the engine is achieved. In a naturally aspirated engine, output power is limited by the ambient [[barometric pressure]]. [[Supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s [[Turbocharger#Pressure increase / boost|boost]] manifold pressure above atmospheric pressure.

==Modern developments==
Modern engines use a manifold absolute pressure (abbreviated as ''MAP'') sensor to measure air pressure in the intake manifold. Manifold absolute pressure is one of a multitude of parameters used by the [[engine control unit]] (ECU) to optimize engine operation. It is important to differentiate between absolute and gauge pressure when dealing with certain applications, particularly those that experience changes in elevation during normal operation.  

Motivated by government regulations mandating reduction of fuel consumption (in the USA) or reduction of [[carbon dioxide emissions]] (in Europe), passenger cars and light trucks have been fitted with a variety of technologies (downsized engines; lockup, multi-ratio and [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive transmissions]]; [[variable valve timing]], forced induction, diesel engines, et al.) which render manifold vacuum inadequate or unavailable. Electric vacuum pumps are now commonly used for powering pneumatic accessories.

==Manifold vacuum vs. venturi vacuum==
Manifold vacuum is caused by a different phenomenon than [[venturi effect|venturi vacuum]], which is present inside [[carburetor]]s. Venturi vacuum is caused by the venturi effect which, for fixed ambient conditions (air density and temperature), depends on the total mass flow through the carburetor. In engines that use carburetors, the venturi vacuum is approximately proportional to the total mass flow through the engine (and hence the total power output). As ambient pressure (altitude, weather) or temperature change, the carburetor may need to be adjusted to maintain this relationship.

Manifold pressure may also be "ported". Porting is selecting a location for the pressure tap within the throttle plate's range of motion. Depending on throttle position, a ported pressure tap may be either upstream or downstream of the throttle. As the throttle position changes, a "ported" pressure tap is selectively connected to either manifold pressure or ambient pressure. Antique (pre-[[OBD II#OBD-II|OBD II]]) engines often used ported manifold pressure taps for [[Distributor|ignition distributors]] and [[Vehicle emissions control#Emissions control|emission-control components]].

==Manifold vacuum in cars==
Most [[automobile]]s use four-stroke [[Otto cycle]] engines with multiple [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s attached to a single [[inlet manifold]]. During the [[induction stroke]], the piston descends in the cylinder and the [[intake valve]] is open. As the piston descends it effectively increases the volume in the cylinder above it, setting up low pressure. Atmospheric pressure pushes air through the manifold and [[carburetor]] or [[fuel injection|fuel injection system]], where it is mixed with fuel. Because multiple cylinders operate at different times in the engine cycle, there is almost constant pressure difference through the inlet manifold from carburetor to engine.

To control the amount of fuel/air mix entering the engine, a simple [[butterfly valve]] (throttle plate) is generally fitted at the start of the intake manifold (just below the [[carburetor]] in carbureted engines). The butterfly valve is simply a circular disc fitted on a spindle, fitting inside the pipe work. It is connected to the accelerator pedal of the car, and is set to be fully open when the pedal is fully depressed and fully closed when the pedal is released. The butterfly valve often contains a small "idle cutout", a hole that allows small amounts of fuel/air mixture into the engine even when the valve is fully closed, or the carburetor has a separate air bypass with its own idle jet.

If the engine is operating under light or no load and low or closed throttle, there is high manifold vacuum. As the throttle is opened, the engine speed increases rapidly. The engine speed is limited only by the amount of fuel/air mixture that is available in the manifold. Under full throttle and light load, other effects (such as [[valve float]], [[turbulence]] in the cylinders, or [[ignition timing]]) limit engine speed so that the manifold pressure can increase—but in practice, [[parasitic drag]] on the internal walls of the manifold, plus the restrictive nature of the venturi at the heart of the carburetor, means that a low pressure will always be set up as the engine's internal volume exceeds the amount of the air the manifold is capable of delivering.

If the engine is operating under heavy load at wide throttle openings (such as accelerating from a stop or pulling the car up a hill) then engine speed is limited by the load and minimal vacuum will be created. Engine speed is low but the butterfly valve is fully open. Since the pistons are descending more slowly than under no load, the pressure differences are less marked and parasitic drag in the induction system is negligible. The engine pulls air into the cylinders at the full ambient pressure.

More vacuum is created in some situations. On deceleration or when descending a hill, the throttle will be closed and a low gear selected to control speed. The engine will be rotating fast because the road wheels and transmission are moving quickly, but the butterfly valve will be fully closed. The flow of air through the engine is strongly restricted by the throttle, producing a strong vacuum on the engine side of the butterfly valve which will tend to limit the speed of the engine. This phenomenon, known as [[engine braking]], is used to prevent acceleration or even to slow down with minimal or no brake usage (as when descending a long or steep hill). This vacuum braking should not be confused with [[Compression release engine brake|compression braking]] (aka a "[[Jake brake]]"), or with [[exhaust brake|exhaust braking]], which are often used on large diesel trucks. Such devices are necessary for engine braking with a diesel as they lack a throttle to restrict the air flow enough to create sufficient vacuum to brake a vehicle.

===Uses of manifold vacuum===
[[File:1929-AEC-Regal-UU6646.jpg|thumb|Autovac fuel lifters. On both buses the red Autovac tank can be seen above and behind the left front wheel.]]
This low (or negative) pressure can be put to uses. A [[pressure gauge]] measuring the manifold pressure can be fitted to give the driver an indication of how hard the engine is working and it can be used to achieve maximum momentary fuel efficiency by adjusting driving habits: minimizing manifold vacuum increases momentary efficiency{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed; source with implementation preferred. Low manifold vacuum may indicate wide open throttle, not high efficiency|date=February 2016}}. A weak manifold vacuum under closed-throttle conditions shows that the butterfly valve or internal components of the engine ([[Poppet valve|valves]] or [[piston ring]]s) are worn, preventing good pumping action by the engine and reducing overall efficiency.

Vacuum is often used to [[Automobile accessory power|drive auxiliary systems]] on the vehicle. [[Vacuum servo|Vacuum-assist brake servos]], for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine manifold vacuum to increase pressure on the brakes. Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high manifold vacuum, this system is simple and almost [[Idiot proof|foolproof]]. Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.

Prior to the introduction of [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] in the USA by the [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act]] of 1966, it was common to use manifold vacuum to drive [[windscreen wiper]]s with a pneumatic motor. This system was cheap &amp; simple but resulted in the comical yet unsafe effect of wipers which operate at full speed while the engine idles, operate around half speed while cruising, and stop altogether when the driver depresses the pedal fully. Vehicle [[HVAC]] systems also used manifold vacuum to drive actuators controlling airflow and temperature.

Another obsolete accessory is the "Autovac" fuel lifter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autovac.co.uk/ autovac.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses vacuum to raise fuel from the main tank to a small auxiliary tank, from which it flows by gravity to the carburetor. This eliminated the fuel pump which, in early cars, was an unreliable item.

===Manifold vacuum in diesel engines===
Many [[diesel engine]]s do not have butterfly valve throttles. The manifold is connected directly to the air intake and the only suction created is that caused by the descending piston with no venturi to increase it, and the engine power is controlled by varying the amount of fuel that is injected into the cylinder by a [[fuel injection]] system. This assists in making diesels much more efficient than petrol engines.

If vacuum is required (vehicles that can be fitted with both petrol and diesel engines often have systems requiring it), a butterfly valve connected to the throttle can be fitted to the manifold. This reduces efficiency and is still not as effective as it is not connected to a venturi. Since low-pressure is only created on the overrun (such as when descending hills with a closed throttle), not over a wide range of situations as in a petrol engine, a vacuum tank is fitted.

Most diesel engines now have a separate vacuum pump ("exhauster") fitted to provide vacuum at all times, at all engine speeds.

Many new [[BMW]] petrol engines do not use a throttle in normal running, but instead use "[[Valvetronic]]" variable-lift intake valves to control the amount of air entering the engine. Like a diesel engine, manifold vacuum is practically non-existent in these engines and a different source must be utilised to power the brake servo.

A '''material''' is a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), [[geological]], [[biological]], choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in the field of [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]

==Classification of materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to, and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture.

Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

'''''Nature''''' is a British [[multidisciplinary]] [[scientific journal]], first published on 4 November 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huxley | first1 = T.

Research scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public. Towards the front of each issue are [[editorial]]s, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying ''supplementary material'' on the journal's website.

There are many fields of [[research]] in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in ''Nature.'' The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/get_published/index.html |title=Getting published in Nature : For authors and referees : Nature |website=nature.com |language=en |access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 ''Nature'' (together with ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'') received the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Communications and Humanity.&lt;ref name=SciNat&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schroeder |first1=Robert |first2= Gretta E.|last2= Siegel | doi = 10.1353/scp.2006.0006 | year = 2006 | title = A Cooperative Publishing Model for Sustainable Scholarship| journal = Journal of Scholarly Publishing | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 86–98 (88)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English the most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the [[Royal Society]], which had published many of the great works from [[Isaac Newton]], [[Michael Faraday]] through to early works from [[Charles Darwin]]. In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Bar3"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Barton | first1 = R. 
| title = Just before Nature: The purposes of science and the purposes of popularization in some english popular science journals of the 1860s

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the editors of these popular science magazines, the publications were designed to serve as "organs of science", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world.&lt;ref name="Bar3"/&gt;

''Nature'', first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede ''Nature'' was ''[[Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation]]'', which, created in 1859, began as a [[natural history]] magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history.&lt;ref name="Bar7"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's name changed from its original title to ''Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreative Science'' and then later to the ''Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Recreative Science'' had attempted to include more physical sciences such as [[astronomy]] and [[archaeology]], the ''Intellectual Observer'' broadened itself further to include literature and art as well.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; Similar to ''Recreative Science'' was the scientific journal ''[[Popular Science Review]]'', created in 1862,&lt;ref name="Bar13"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled "Scientific Summary" or "Quarterly Retrospect", with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications.&lt;ref name="Bar13"/&gt; Two other journals produced in England prior to the development of ''Nature'' were the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' and ''[[Scientific Opinion]]'', established in 1864 and 1868, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; The journal most closely related to ''Nature'' in its editorship and format was ''The Reader'', created in 1864; the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community, similar to ''Popular Science Review''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt;

These similar journals all ultimately failed. The ''Popular Science Review'' survived longest, lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881; ''Recreative Science'' ceased publication as the ''Student and Intellectual Observer'' in 1871. The ''Quarterly Journal'', after undergoing a number of editorial changes, ceased publication in 1885. ''The Reader'' terminated in 1867, and finally, ''Scientific Opinion'' lasted a mere 2 years, until June 1870.&lt;ref name="Bar7"/&gt;

===Creation ===
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First title page, 4 November 1869]]
Not long after the conclusion of ''The Reader'', a former editor, [[Norman Lockyer]], decided to create a new scientific journal titled ''Nature'',&lt;ref name="B248"&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; taking its name from a line by [[William Wordsworth]]: "To the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww698.html Poem: "A Volant Tribe of Bards on earth are found"]. Bartleby.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; First owned and published by [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], ''Nature'' was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to "provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Janet Browne has proposed that "far more than any other science journal of the period, ''Nature'' was conceived, born, and raised to serve polemic purpose."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Many of the early editions of ''Nature'' consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the [[X Club]], a group of scientists known for having liberal, progressive, and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period.&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Initiated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the group consisted of such important scientists as [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[John Tyndall]], along with another five scientists and mathematicians; these scientists were all avid supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution as [[common descent]], a theory which, during the latter half of the 19th century, received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made ''Nature'' a longer-lasting success than its predecessors. [[John Maddox]], editor of ''Nature'' from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; "journalism" Maddox states, "is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other. This is what Lockyer's journal did from the start."&lt;ref name="Dinner"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1970|title=The 'Nature' Centenary Dinner|jstor=530861|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 25|issue=1|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1970.0002 |pages=9–15(13)|author1=Maddox, John  |author2=Macmillan, Harold  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the Macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it.&lt;ref name="Dinner"/&gt;
 
====Editors====
[[Norman Lockyer]], the founder of ''Nature'', was a professor at [[Imperial College]]. He was succeeded as editor in 1919 by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]].&lt;ref name="NPG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml/02_history.xml&amp;style=xml/02_history.xsl |title=Nature Publishing Group: History |website=nature.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115084545/http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml%2F02_history.xml&amp;style=xml%2F02_history.xsl |archivedate=15 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory helped to establish ''Nature'' in the international scientific community. His obituary by the Royal Society stated: "Gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science, and in the columns of ''Nature'' he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the International Scientific Unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Richard Arman Gregory, 1864–1952|journal= Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume= 8|issue=22|pages=410–417 (413)|year=1953|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1953.0007 |author=Stratton, F. J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years 1945 to 1973, editorship of ''Nature'' changed three times, first in 1945 to A. J. V. Gale and [[L. J. F. Brimble]] (who in 1958 became the sole editor), then to [[John Maddox]] in 1965, and finally to [[David 'Dai' Davies|David Davies]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt; In 1980, Maddox returned as editor and retained his position until 1995. [[Philip Campbell (scientist)|Philip Campbell]] has since become Editor-in-chief of all ''Nature'' publications.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt;

====Expansion and development====
In 1970, ''Nature'' first opened its Washington office; other branches opened in New York in 1985, Tokyo and Munich in 1987, Paris in 1989, San Francisco in 2001, Boston in 2004, and Hong Kong in 2005. In 1971, under [[John Maddox]]'s editorship, the journal split into ''Nature Physical Sciences'' (published on Mondays), ''Nature New Biology'' (published on Wednesdays) and ''Nature'' (published on Fridays). In 1974, Maddox was no longer editor, and the journals were merged into ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;

 |language=en
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, the journal underwent a great deal of expansion, launching over ten new journals. These new journals comprise the Nature Publishing Group, which was created in 1999 and includes ''Nature'', Nature Publishing Group Journals, Stockton Press Specialist Journals and Macmillan Reference (renamed NPG Reference).

In 1996, ''Nature'' created its own website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/timeline2.html|title = Branching out (1970–1999)|date = |accessdate = 2014-11-13|website = nature.com|publisher = Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 Nature Publishing Group began its series of ''Nature Reviews''.&lt;ref name="NPG" /&gt; Some articles and papers are available for free on the Nature website. Others require the purchase of premium access to the site. ''Nature'' claims an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-a-new-ipad-app-for-nature-readers-1.12002 | title=Announcement: A new iPad app for Nature readers | work=Nature | date=12 December 2012 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2008, ''Nature'' endorsed an American presidential candidate for the first time when it supported [[Barack Obama]] during his campaign in [[United States presidential election, 2008|America's 2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/4551149a |title=America's choice |year=2008 |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7217 |page=1149 |bibcode=2008Natur.455Q1149. |pmid=18971969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Angliss |url=http://www.scholarsandrogues.com/2008/10/31/nature-endorses-obama/ |title=Weekly science journal ''Nature'' endorses a presidential candidate: Barack Obama (updated) |website=Scholars &amp; Rogues |date=31 October 2008 |access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, an [[Nature Arabic Edition|Arabic edition]] of the magazine was launched in partnership with [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]]. As of the time it was released, it had about 10,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name=NatureME&gt;{{cite web |last= Yahia |first= Mohammed |title= Nature Arabic Edition launches |quote= The first issue of ''Nature Arabic Edition'', an Arabic translation of ''Nature'', has been released.

On 2 December 2014, ''Nature'' announced that it would allow its subscribers and a group of selected media outlets to share links allowing free, "read-only" access to content from its journals. These articles are presented using the [[digital rights management]] system [[ReadCube]] (which is funded by the Macmillan subsidiary Digital Science), and does not allow readers to download, copy, print, or otherwise distribute the content. While it does, to an extent, provide free online access to articles, it is not a true [[open access]] scheme due to its restrictions on re-use and distribution.&lt;ref name=wired-naturefreeview&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature journal subscribers can now share article links globally|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|website=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=3 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202182430/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|archivedate=2 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-npgreadonly&gt;{{cite news|title=Science journal ''Nature'' to make archives available online|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/02/nature-archives-free|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2015, details of a proposed merger with Springer Science+Business Media were announced.&lt;ref&gt;Schuetze, Arno (15 January 2015). [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/15/publishing-ma-idUSF9N0TV00F20150115 "Nature magazine publisher to merge with Springer Science"]. [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 it came under the umbrella of Springer Nature, by the merger of [[Springer Science+Business Media]] and [[Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]]'s [[Nature Publishing Group]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], and [[Macmillan Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/about-springer/media/press-releases/corporate/springer-nature-created-following-merger-completion/256626 |title=Springer Nature created following merger completion |date=6 May 2015 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication in Nature==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}

Being published in ''Nature'' or any ''Nature'' publication is very prestigious. In particular, empirical papers are often highly cited, which can lead to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these [[positive feedback]] effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like ''Nature'' and its closest competitor, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', can be very fierce. ''Nature''{{'}}s [[impact factor]], a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by [[Institute for Scientific Information|Thomson ISI]]), among the highest of any science journal.

As with most other professional scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by [[peer review]] (in which other scientists, chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, will read and critique articles), before publication. In the case of ''Nature'', they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.

According to ''Nature''{{'}}s original [[mission statement]]:
{{quote|It is intended, FIRST, to place before the general public the grand results of Scientific Work and Scientific Discovery; and to urge the claims of Science to a more general recognition in Education and in Daily Life; and, SECONDLY, to aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from time to time.&lt;ref name=nature1869&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/mission.html |title=Nature's mission statement |accessdate=11 September 2008 |work= nature.com|date=11 November 1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was revised in 2000 to:
{{quote|First, to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science. Second, to ensure that the results of science are rapidly disseminated to the public throughout the world, in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge, culture and daily life.&lt;ref name=nature2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/about/index.html |title=Nature's mission statement |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Landmark papers===
Many of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in modern history have been first published in ''Nature''.

===Controversies===
In 2017, Nature published an editorial entitled "Removing Statues of Historical figures risks whitewashing history: Science must acknowledge mistakes as it marks its past". The article commented on the placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical, abusive and torturous histories. Specifically, the editorial called on examples of [[J. Marion Sims]], the 'Father of gynecology' who experimented on African American female slaves who were unable to give informed consent, and [[Thomas Parran Jr.]] who oversaw the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].  The editorial as written made the case that removing such statues, and erasing names, runs the risk of "whitewashing history", and stated “Instead of removing painful reminders, perhaps these should be supplemented”. The article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Science must acknowledge its past mistakes and crimes |date=4 September 2017 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/science-must-acknowledge-its-past-mistakes-and-crimes-1.22557?sf111543858=1&amp;WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was largely seen as offensive, inappropriate, and by many, racist. Nature acknowledged that the article as originally written was "offensive and poorly worded" and published selected letters of response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Readers respond to Nature’s Editorial on historical monuments |date=8 September 2017 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/readers-respond-to-nature-s-editorial-on-historical-monuments-1.22584 |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial came just weeks after hundreds of white supremacists marched in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in the [[Unite the Right Rally|Unite the Right rally]] to oppose the removal of [[Robert Edward Lee Sculpture|a statue of Robert E. Lee]], setting off violence in the streets and killing a young woman. When Nature posted a link to the editorial on [[Twitter]], the thread quickly exploded with criticisms. In response, several scientists called for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schulson |first=Michael |title=History Lessons for ‘Nature’|date=17 September 2017 |newspaper=Undark Magazine |url=https://undark.org/article/nature-journal-j-marion-sims/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2017, the editorial was updated and edited by Philip Campbell, the editor of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Campbell |first=Philip |title=Statues: An Editorial Response|date= 18 September 2017 |newspaper=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/549334c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Paul Lauterbur]] and [[Peter Mansfield]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for research initially rejected by ''Nature'' and published only after Lauterbur appealed the rejection, ''Nature'' acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled, "Coping with Peer Rejection":
{{quote|[T]here are unarguable ''faux pas'' in our history. These include the rejection of [[Čherenkov radiation|Cherenkov radiation]], [[Hideki Yukawa]]'s [[meson]], work on [[photosynthesis]] by [[Johann Deisenhofer]], [[Robert Huber]] and [[Hartmut Michel]], and the initial rejection (but eventual acceptance) of [[Stephen Hawking]]'s [[Hawking radiation|black-hole radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/full/425645a.html |journal=Nature |date=16 October 2003 |title=Coping with peer rejection |volume=425 |page=645 |doi=10.1038/425645a |pmid=14562060 |issue=6959 |bibcode=2003Natur.425..645.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 2000 to 2001, a series of five fraudulent papers by [[Schön scandal|Jan Hendrik Schön]] was published in ''Nature''. The papers, about [[semiconductors]], were revealed to contain falsified data and other scientific fraud. In 2003, ''Nature'' retracted the papers. The Schön scandal was not limited to ''Nature''; other prominent journals, such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Physical Review]]'', also retracted papers by Schön.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v422/n6927/index.html |journal=Nature |date=6 March 2003 |title=Retractions' realities |volume=422 |issue=6927 |page=1 |doi=10.1038/422001a |pmid=12621394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1988, after nearly a year of guided scrutiny from its editors, ''Nature'' published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing Dr. [[Jacques Benveniste]] and his team's work studying human [[Basophil granulocyte|basophil]] [[degranulation]] in the presence of extremely dilute [[antibody]] serum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vet-servis.ru/downloads/nature333-30-1988.pdf |title=vet-servis.ru |publisher=Vet-servis.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, their paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils, defying the physical [[law of mass action]]. The paper excited substantial media attention in Paris, chiefly because their research sought funding from [[homeopathic]] medicine companies. Public inquiry prompted ''Nature'' to mandate an extensive, stringent and scientifically questionable experimental [[replication (statistics)|replication]] in Benveniste's lab, through which his team's results were categorically refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Before publishing one of its most famous discoveries, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s 1953 [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|paper]] on the [[structure of DNA]], ''Nature'' did not send the paper out for peer review. [[John Maddox]], ''Nature''{{'}}s editor, stated: "the Watson and Crick paper was not peer-reviewed by ''Nature'' ... the paper could not have been refereed: its correctness is self-evident. No referee working in the field ... could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maddox |first1=J. |doi=10.1038/426119b |title=How genius can smooth the road to publication |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6963 |page=119 |year=2003|bibcode=2003Natur.426..119M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier error occurred when [[Enrico Fermi]] submitted his breakthrough paper on the weak [[Fermi's interaction|interaction theory]] of [[beta decay]]. ''Nature'' turned down the paper because it was considered too remote from reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhodes, Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb|publisher= Touchstone|location= New York|date= 1986|isbn= 0-671-44133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi's paper was published by ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fermi |first1=E. |title=Versuch einer Theorie der β-Strahlen. I |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=88 |issue=3–4 |pages=161–177 |year=1934 |doi=10.1007/BF01351864 |bibcode=1934ZPhy...88..161F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally published by ''Nature'' five years later,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} after Fermi's work had been widely accepted.

==Science fiction==
In 1999 ''Nature'' began publishing [[science fiction]] [[short stories]]. The brief "[[vignette (literature)|vignettes]]" are printed in a series called "Futures". The stories appeared in 1999 and 2000, again in 2005 and 2006, and have appeared weekly since July 2007.&lt;ref name="futures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/arts/futures/ | title=Futures | work=Nature | accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister publication ''[[Nature Physics]]'' also printed stories in 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesPhysics"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/nphys/archive/categ_fut_012008.html |title=Futures Archive |work= [[Nature Physics]] |accessdate= 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Nature'' was awarded the [[European Science Fiction Society]]'s Best Publisher award for the "Futures" series.&lt;ref name="ESFSAward"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esfs.info/esfs-awards-2000.html#2005 |title= The ESFS Awards, Eurocon 2005: Glasgow – Scotland |author= [[European Science Fiction Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred of the ''Nature'' stories between 1999 and 2006 were published as the collection ''Futures from Nature'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesCollection"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.tor-forge.com/futuresfromnature |title= Futures from Nature: 100 Speculative fictions from the pages of the leading science journal |editor= Henry Gee |publisher= [[Tor Books]] |date= 2008 |location= New York City |isbn= 0-7653-1805-9 |quote= With stories from: [[Arthur C.

==Publication ==
[[File:Nature Materials Nov 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Nature Materials]],'' a specialized journal from [[Nature Publishing Group]].]]
The journal has a weekly circulation of around 53,000 and a pass-along rate of 8.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Demographics: Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/advertising/resources/pdf/2010naturemediakit.pdf?prod_code=NATURE&amp;prod=Nature |website=nature.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513233735/http://www.nature.com/advertising/resources/pdf/2010naturemediakit.pdf?prod_code=NATURE&amp;prod=Nature |archivedate=2011-05-13}}, a profile of Nature's readership.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a readership of over 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Selling Your Publication — Circulation vs. Readership |url=http://www.ads-on-line.com/newbasiccourse/products/ |date=2013 |publisher=McInnis &amp; Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nature'' is edited and published in the United Kingdom by a division of the international [[scientific publishing]] company [[Springer Nature]] that publishes [[academic journal]]s, [[magazine]]s, online databases, and services in science and medicine. ''Nature'' has offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[Boston]], Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, [[Munich]], and [[Basingstoke]]. Nature Publishing Group also publishes other specialized journals including ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''[[Nature Biotechnology]],'' ''[[Nature Methods]]'', the ''[[Nature Clinical Practice]]'' series of journals, ''[[Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology]]'', ''[[Nature Chemistry]]'', and the ''Nature Reviews'' series of journals.

Since 2005, each issue of ''Nature'' has been accompanied by a ''[[Nature Podcast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/archive.html | work = Nature |title = Archive: Nature Podcast |accessdate = 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring highlights from the issue and interviews with the articles' authors and the journalists covering the research. It is presented by Kerri Smith, and features interviews with scientists on the latest research, as well as news reports from Nature's editors and journalists. The Nature Podcast was founded – and the first 100 episodes were produced and presented – by clinician and virologist [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Chris Smith]] of Cambridge and ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.

In 2007, Nature Publishing Group began publishing ''Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics'', the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics and ''Molecular Therapy'', the American Society of Gene Therapy's official journal, as well as the ''International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME) Journal''. Nature Publishing Group launched ''Nature Photonics'' in 2007 and ''Nature Geoscience'' in 2008. ''Nature Chemistry'' published its first issue in April 2009.

Nature Publishing Group actively supports the self-archiving process and in 2002 was one of the first publishers to allow authors to post their contributions on their personal websites, by requesting an exclusive licence to publish, rather than requiring authors to transfer copyright. In December 2007, Nature Publishing Group introduced the Creative Commons attribution-non commercial-share alike unported licence for those articles in Nature journals that are publishing the primary sequence of an organism's genome for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1864.html |title=Interview with Timo Hannay, director of web publishing for Nature Publishing Group |work=Jon Udell's Interviews with Innovators |date=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a collection of articles from ''Nature'' was edited by John S. Partington under the title ''H. G. Wells in Nature, 1893–1946: A Reception Reader'' and published by Peter Lang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Partington, John S. |year=2008 |title=H. G.

[[File:Map of new7wonders of nature.png|thumb|300 px|A map indicating the location of the 28 finalists (red dots) and the 42 other candidates currently on the reserve list (black dots).]]
'''New7Wonders of Nature''' (2007–2011) was an initiative started in 2007 to create a list of seven natural wonders chosen by people through a global poll. It was led by Swiss-born Canadian Bernard Weber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.new7wonders.com/about-n7w/the-founder|title=The project founder Bernard Weber - A Short History - World of New7Wonders|work=World of New7Wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://about.new7wonders.com/the-project-founder-bernard-weber-a-short-history/|title=The project founder|website=About New7Wonders|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organized by the New 7 Wonders Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.new7wonders.com/about-n7w/about-new7wonders|title=Learn about New7Wonders|work=World of New7Wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Swiss-based foundation which Weber founded. The initiative followed an earlier [[New7Wonders of the World]] campaign, and attracted 100 million votes from around the world before voting finished on November 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.new7wonders.com/new7wonders-of-nature/new7wonders-of-nature-voting-procedure|title=Voting procedure|work=World of New7Wonders|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331012028/http://world.new7wonders.com/new7wonders-of-nature/new7wonders-of-nature-voting-procedure/|archivedate=2013-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of the campaign==
The New7Wonders of Nature campaign started in 2007, immediately after the campaign to elect the man-made New7Wonders of the World, in which more than 100 million votes were cast. From over 440 participants representing over 220 countries and through a national qualification and race to become one of the Top 77, as well as the recommendations of the Panel of Experts led by Prof. Federico Mayor, the list of 28 "Official Finalist Candidates" was determined. Voting until November 2011, during which time the New7Wonders World Tour planned to visit each of the finalists to allow them to present themselves to the voters across the globe.

==Criticisms==
Indonesia's Vice-Minister for Tourism said the company running the New7Wonders campaign used underhanded tactics, threatening to remove Indonesia's Komodo National Park from the list if Indonesia refused to host a declaration ceremony for $35m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2011/11/2011111165513200704.html|title=Controversy mars Seven Wonders of Nature list|work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nothing in the New7Wonders voting procedure prohibited repetitive voting, making the results subject to government and tourism industry campaigns to vote often for local sites with the financial incentive of increased tourism.
Although New7Wonders is a non-profit organization that under US law has absolutely no disclosure of accounts, many activities related to administering voting and other logistical duties are run by the for-profit organization New Open World Corporation.

In South Korea, over the past four years, millions of Koreans and non-Koreans at home and abroad were encouraged by the central and Jeju provincial governments to make phone calls to vote and help the island win the designation. Employees of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province of South Korea made hundreds of millions of international phone calls to ensure Jeju island was selected as one of the New7Wonders of Nature in a worldwide poll. The payments estimated to be about 20 billion won ($17 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jeju defers payment of phone bills for seven wonders |publisher=The Korea Times |date=December 14, 2011 |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/03/117_100815.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pebbleswithquarzite.jpg|thumb|Pebbles on a [[shingle beach]] in [[Somerset]], England]]

A '''pebble''' is a [[clastic rocks|clast]] of [[rock (geology)|rock]] with a [[grain size|particle size]] of 2 to 64 millimetres based on the [[Particle size (grain size)|Krumbein phi scale]] of [[sedimentology]]. Pebbles are generally considered larger than [[Granule (geology)|granules]] (2&amp;nbsp;to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]] (64&amp;nbsp;to 256 millimetres diameter). A rock made predominantly of pebbles is termed a [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]].  [[oldowan|Pebble tools]] are among the earliest known man-made artifacts, dating from the [[Palaeolithic]] period of human history.

A beach composed chiefly of surface pebbles is commonly termed a [[shingle beach]]. This type of beach has [[armor (hydrology)|armoring characteristics]] with respect to wave [[erosion]], as well as ecological niches that provide [[habitat]] for animals and plants.

Inshore banks of shingle (large quantities of pebbles) exist in some locations, such as the entrance to the [[River Ore]], where the moving banks of shingle give notable navigational challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmyharbour.com/harbours/east-coast/ore-alde-rivers/|title=Ore and Alde, Rivers - East Coast: pilotage, charts, photos and marine business listings|author=|date=|website=www.visitmyharbour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pebbles come in various colors and textures and can have streaks, known as [[Vein (geology)|vein]]s, of [[quartz]] or other [[mineral]]s. Pebbles are mostly smooth but, dependent on how frequently they come in contact with the sea, they can have marks of contact with other rocks or other pebbles. Pebbles left above the [[tide|high water mark]] may have growths of organisms such as [[lichen]] on them, signifying the lack of contact with [[seawater]].

== Location ==

Pebbles are found in two locations – on the beaches of various oceans and seas, and inland where ancient seas used to cover the land. When then the seas retreated, the rocks became landlocked. They can also be found in lakes and ponds. Pebbles can also form in [[river]]s, and travel into [[estuary|estuaries]] where the smoothing continues in the sea.

Beach pebbles and river pebbles (also known as river rock) are distinct in their geological formation and appearance.

=== Beach ===
[[File:Pebbles in Rethymno's beach.jpg|alt= Pebbles in Rethymno's beach, Crete.|thumb|Pebbles in [[Rethymno]]'s beach, [[Crete]].]]
Beach pebbles form gradually over time as the ocean water washes over loose rock particles. The result is a smooth, rounded appearance.  The typical size range is from 2&amp;nbsp;mm to 50&amp;nbsp;mm. The colors range from translucent white to black, and include shades of yellow, brown, red and green.  Some of the more plentiful pebble beaches are found along the coast of the [[Pacific Ocean]], beginning in the United States and extending down to the tip of South America in Argentina. Other pebble beaches are found in northern Europe (particularly on the beaches of the [[Norwegian Sea]]), along the coast of the U.K. and Ireland, on the shores of Australia, and around the islands of Indonesia and Japan.

=== Inland ===

Inland pebbles (river pebbles of river rock) are usually found along the shores of large rivers and lakes. These pebbles form as the flowing water washes over rock particles on the bottom and along the shores of the [[river]]. The smoothness and color of river pebbles depends on several factors, such as the composition of the [[soil]] of the river banks, the chemical characteristics of the water, and the speed of the [[Water current|current]].  Because river current is gentler than the [[Wind wave|ocean waves]], river pebbles are usually not as smooth as beach pebbles. The most common colors of river rock are black, grey, green, brown and white.

== Human use ==
[[File:Pebble lane.JPG|thumb|A walkway decorated with pebbles set into concrete.]]
Beach pebbles and river pebbles are used for a variety of purposes, both outdoors and indoors.  They can be sorted by colour and size, and they can also be polished to improve the texture and colour. Outdoors, beach pebbles are often used for [[landscaping]], [[building construction|construction]] and as decorative elements. Beach pebbles are often used to cover walkways and driveways, around pools, in and around plant containers, on patios and decks. Beach and river pebbles are also used to create water-smart gardens in areas where water is scarce. Small pebbles are also used to create living spaces and gardens on the rooftops of buildings. Indoors, pebbles can be used as [[bookend]]s and [[paperweight]]s. Large pebbles are also used to create "[[pet rocks]]" for children.

==  Extraterrestrial occurrences ==
On [[Mars]], slabs of pebbly conglomerate rock have been found and have been interpreted by scientists as having formed in an ancient streambed. The gravels, which were discovered by [[NASA]]'s Mars rover [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]], range from the size of sand particles to the size of golf balls. Analysis has shown that the pebbles were deposited by a stream that flowed at walking pace and was ankle- to hip-deep.&lt;ref name="Mars1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-305 | title=NASA Rover Finds Old Streambed on Martian Surface | publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] / [[California Institute of Technology]] | work=News | date=27 September 2012 | accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">'''Political naturalism''' is a minor [[political ideology]] and [[legal system]] which believes that there is a [[natural law]], just and obvious to all, that crosses ideologies, faiths and personal thinking, that naturally guaranties justice. It is inspired by [[sociological naturalism]], and [[methodological naturalism|scientific naturalism]]'s belief that the precision of [[natural sciences]] can be applied to social sciences, and hence to practical social activities like politics and law.

It may be seen as a natural law-based version of [[Liberal legalism|legalism]]/[[constitutionalism]] (especially [[Constitutionalism#Prescriptive use|of prescriptive constitutionalism]], in the way it tries, idealistically, to make a constitution how it should justly be), and it bears relation with many [[constitutional monarchies]] (as in that system they too believe in [[rule of the law]] and in certain things who are naturally correct (like [[monarchy]], monarchic [[institutions]] and [[traditions]].

The roots of this legal political ideology may be found in positive visions of natural law (like [[John Locke]]'s and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s, and even in the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence|United States Declaration of Independence]], 1776, "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic]] [[Germany|German]] [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] politician and diplomat Karl Friedrich von Savigny also thought so.&lt;ref&gt;He stated that "laws are not made ''but found''", implying the existence of already existing natural laws.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main modern thinker is [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar and creator of the [[Egyptian Civil Code]] [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri|Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Abd Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri, Egyptian Civil Code, Article 1, 1949, ''«in the absence of any applicable legislation, the judge shall decide according to the custom and failing the custom, according to the principles of Islamic Law. In the absence of these principles,'' '''the judge shall have recourse to natural law''' ''and the rules of equity.»''&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Egyptian Code, many other Arab constitutions (in monarchist and pre-dictatorships [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] and modern [[Qatar]]) ended up including political naturalist laws, and Al-Sanhuri himself wrote the [[Syrian]] and [[Jordan]]ian [[civil codes]] and the [[Kuwait]]i [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]].

'''Rubble''' is broken [[rock (geology)|stone]], of irregular size, shape&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rubble |volume=23 |page=804}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texture; undressed especially as a filling-in. Rubble naturally found in the soil is known also as ''''brash'''' (compare [[cornbrash]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Rubble" def. 2., "Brash n. 2. def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Where present, it becomes more noticeable when the land is ploughed or worked.

==Building==
[[Image:Wyggestons Chantry House, rubblework.jpg|thumb|Rubble-work on [[Newarke Houses Museum|Wyggeston's Chantry House]] in [[Leicester]], built c. 1511]]

"[[Rubble-work]]" is a name applied to several types of [[masonry]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; One kind, where the stones are loosely thrown together in a wall between boards and [[grout]]ed with [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] almost like [[concrete]], is called in [[Italian language|Italian]] "muraglia di getto" and in [[French language|French]] "bocage".&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; In Pakistan, walls made of rubble and concrete, cast in a formwork, are called 'situ', which probably derives from Sanskrit (similar to the Latin 'in situ' meaning 'made on the spot').

Work executed with more or less large stones put together without any attempt at [[Course (architecture)|courses]] is called rubble&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; walling. Where similar work is laid in courses, it is known as coursed rubble. [[Dry-stone wall]]ing is somewhat similar work done without the use of mortar. It is bound together by the fit of the stones and the regular placement of stones which extend through the thickness of the wall. A rubble wall built with mortar will be stronger if assembled in this way.

===Rubble walls in Malta===
[[File:Ta' Dmejrek-IMG 1500.jpg|thumb|Rubble wall near [[Dingli]], [[Malta]]]]

Rubble walls ({{lang-mt|ħitan tas-sejjieħ}}) are found all over the island of [[Malta]]. Similar walls are also frequently found in Sicily and the Arab countries. The various shapes and sizes of the stones used to build these walls look like stones that were found in the area lying on the ground or in the soil.  It is most probable that the practice of building these walls around the field was inspired by the Arabs during their rule in Malta, as in Sicily who were also ruled by the Arabs around the same period. The Maltese farmer found that the technique of these walls was very useful especially during an era where resources were limited. Rubble walls are used to serve as borders between the property of one farm from the other. A great advantage that  rubble walls offered is that when heavy rain falls, their structure would allow excessive water to pass through and therefore, excess water will not ruin the products. Soil erosion is minimised as the wall structure allows the water to pass through but it traps the soil and prevents it from being carried away from the field. One can see many rubble walls on the side of the hills and in valleys where the land slopes down and consequently the soil is in greater danger of being carried away.

[[File:Orion1 big.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Airglow made visible from aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]

'''Sky brightness''' refers to the [[visual perception]] of the [[sky]] and how it [[light scattering|scatters]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuses]] light. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at [[night]] is easily visible. If light sources (e.g. the [[moonlight|Moon]] and [[light pollution]]) were removed from the [[night sky]], it would appear absolutely dark. [[Silhouette]]s of objects against the sky itself would not be visible.

The sky's brightness varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause differs as well. During [[daytime]], when the [[Sun]] is above the horizon, the [[Rayleigh scattering|direct scattering]] of [[sunlight]] is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. During [[twilight]] (the duration after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]] until or since, respectively, the full darkness of night), the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required.

Twilight (both [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]) is divided into three 6° segments that mark the Sun's position below the horizon. At [[civil twilight]], the center of the Sun's disk appears to be between 1/4° and 6° below the horizon. At [[nautical twilight]], the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] is between –6° and –12°. At [[astronomical twilight]], the Sun is between –12° and –18°. When the Sun's depth is more than 18°, the sky generally attains its maximum darkness.

Sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include [[airglow]], indirect scattering of [[sunlight]], scattering of [[starlight]], and [[skyglow|light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Patat |url=http://www.eso.org/~fpatat/science/skybright/ |title=The Brightness of the Night Sky |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airglow==
When physicist [[Anders Ångström]] examined the spectrum of the [[aurora borealis]], he discovered that even on nights when the aurora was absent, its characteristic green line was still present. It was not until the 1920s that scientists were beginning to identify and understand the [[emission line]]s in aurorae and of the sky itself, and what was causing them. The green line Angstrom observed is in fact an emission line with a wavelength of 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, caused by the recombination of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

Airglow is the collective name of the various processes in the upper atmosphere that result in the emission of photons, with the driving force being primarily [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the Sun. Several emission lines are dominant: a green line from oxygen at 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, a yellow doublet from sodium at 589.0 and 589.6&amp;nbsp;nm, and red lines from oxygen at 630.0 and 636.4&amp;nbsp;nm.

The sodium emissions come from a thin [[sodium layer]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km thick at an altitude of 90–100&amp;nbsp;km, above the [[mesopause]] and in the D-layer of the [[ionosphere]]. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of [[sea salt]] and [[meteor]]itic dust.

In daytime, sodium and red oxygen emissions are dominant and roughly 1,000 times as bright as nighttime emissions because in daytime, the upper atmosphere is fully exposed to solar UV radiation. The effect is however not noticeable to the human eye, since the glare of [[Rayleigh scattering|directly scattered]] sunlight outshines and obscures it.

==Indirect scattering of sunlight==
[[Image:Illuminated-arimass.png|250px|thumb|Amount of air still illuminated after sunset, at the horizon. Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass]]
Indirectly scattered sunlight comes from two directions. From the atmosphere itself, and from outer space. In the first case, the sun has just set but still illuminates the upper atmosphere directly. Because the amount of scattered sunlight is proportional to the number of scatterers (i.e. air molecules) in the line of sight, the intensity of this light decreases rapidly as the sun drops further below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere.

When the sun's altitude is &lt; -6° 99% of the atmosphere in [[zenith]] is in the Earth's shadow and second order scattering takes over. At the horizon, however, 35% of the atmosphere along the line of sight is still directly illuminated, and continues to be until the sun reaches -12°. From -12° to -18° only the uppermost parts of the atmosphere along the horizon, directly above the spot where the sun is, is still illuminated. After that, all direct illumination ceases and astronomical darkness sets in.

A second source sunlight is the [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by reflection and scattering of sunlight on interplanetary dust. Zodiacal light varies quite a lot in intensity depending on the position of the earth, location of the observer, time of year, and composition and distribution of the reflecting dust.

==Scattered light from extraterrestrial sources==
Not only sunlight is scattered by the molecules in the air. Starlight and the diffuse light of the milky way are also scattered by the air, and it is found that stars up to V magnitude 16 contribute to the diffuse scattered starlight.

Other sources such as galaxies and nebulae don't contribute significantly.

The total brightness of all the stars was first measured by Burns in 1899, with a calculated result that the total brightness reaching earth was equivalent to that of 2,000 first-magnitude stars &lt;ref&gt;Burns, G. J., "The total amount of starlight and the brightness of the sky," ''The Observatory, Vol. 33'', p. 123-129, March 1910; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1910Obs....33..123B SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent measurements by others.&lt;ref&gt;Yntema, L., "On the Brightness of the Sky and Total Amount of Starlight," ''Publications of the Kapteyn Astronomical Laboratory Groningen, vol. 22'', pp.1-55 (1909); available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1909PGro...22....1Y SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
''

==Light pollution==
{{Main|Light pollution}}
Light pollution is an ever-increasing source of sky brightness in [[Urban area|urbanized area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In densely populated areas that do not have stringent light pollution control, the entire night sky is regularly 5 to 50 times brighter than it would be if all lights were switched off, and very often the influence of light pollution is far greater than natural sources (including moonlight). With [[urbanization]] and light pollution, one third of humanity, and the majority of those in developed countries, cannot see the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution|title=Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2016-06-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twilight==
When the sun has just set, the brightness of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and nautical twilight.

After the sun has also set for these altitudes at the end of nautical twilight, the intensity of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.

When astronomical darkness has set in, the green 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen line is dominant, and atmospheric scattering of starlight occurs.

Differential refraction causes different parts of the spectrum to dominate, producing a [[Golden hour (photography)|golden hour]] and a [[blue hour]].

==Relative contributions==
The following table gives the relative and absolute contributions to night sky brightness at zenith on a perfectly dark night at middle latitudes without moonlight and in the absence of any [[light pollution]].

(The S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; unit is defined as the surface brightness of a star whose V-magnitude is 10 and whose light is smeared over one square degree, or 27.78 mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The total sky brightness in zenith is therefore ~220 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or 21.9 mag/arcsec² in the V-band. Note that the contributions from Airglow and Zodiacal light vary with the time of year, the solar cycle, and the observer's latitude roughly as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Airglow}/{\rm S}_{10} = 145+108(S-0.8)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the solar 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm flux in MJy, and various sinusoidally between 0.8 and 2.0 with the 11-year solar cycle, yielding an upper contribution of ~270 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; at solar maximum.

The intensity of zodiacal light depends on the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude and longitude]] of the point in the sky being observed relative to that of the sun. At ecliptic longitudes differing from the sun's by &gt; 90 degrees, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm ZodiacalLight}/{\rm S}_{10} = 140 - 90\sin(|\beta|)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''β'' is the ecliptic latitude and is smaller than 60°, when larger than 60 degrees the contribution is that given in the table. Along the ecliptic plane there are enhancements in the zodiacal light where it is much brighter near the sun and with a secondary maximum opposite the sun at 180 degrees longitude (the [[gegenschein]]).

In extreme cases natural zenith sky brightness can be as high as ~21.0 mag/arcsec², roughly twice as bright as nominal conditions.

A '''sorbent''' is a material used to [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] or [[Adsorption|adsorb]] liquids or gases. Examples include:
*A material similar to [[molecular sieve]] material, which acts by adsorption (attracting molecules to its surface). It has a large internal [[surface area]] and good [[thermal conductivity]]. It is typically supplied in pellets of 1&amp;nbsp;mm to 2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter and roughly 5&amp;nbsp;mm length or as grains of the order 1&amp;nbsp;mm. Occasionally as beads up to 5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter. They are typically made from [[aluminium oxide]] with a porous structure.
*Materials used to absorb other materials due to their high [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] for doing so. Examples include:
**In [[composting]], dry (brown, high-[[carbon]]) materials absorb many [[odoriferous]] [[chemical]]s, and these chemicals help to decompose these sorbents.
**A [[sponge]] absorbs many times its own weight in water.
**A [[polypropylene]] fiber mat may be used to absorb oil.
**A [[cellulose]] fiber product may be used to absorb oil.
**The granular gel material in a baby [[diaper]] will absorb several times its original weight in [[urine]].

**[[Desiccant]]s attract water, [[drying]] out ([[desiccation|desiccating]]) the surrounding materials.

'''Surface conductivity''' is an additional [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of an [[electrolyte]] in the vicinity of charged surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Surface and [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] correspond to the electrically driven motion of [[ions]] in an [[electric field]].&lt;/ref&gt; Close to charged surfaces a layer of [[counter ion]]s of opposite polarity exists which is attracted by the [[surface charge]]s. This layer of higher ionic concentration is a part of the interfacial [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. The concentration of the ions in this layer is higher as compared to the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] far from the charged surface and leads to a higher conductivity of this layer.

[[Marian Smoluchowski|Smoluchowski]] was the first to recognize the importance of surface conductivity at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. von Smoluchowski, Physik, Z., 6, 529 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a detailed description of surface conductivity by Lyklema in "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science" &lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol. 2, Academic Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Double Layer (DL) has two regions, according to the well established Gouy-Chapman-Stern model, Ref.2. The upper level, which is in contact with the bulk fluid is the [[diffuse layer]]. The inner layer that is in contact with interface is the [[Stern layer]].

It is possible that the lateral motion of ions in both parts of the DL contributes to the surface conductivity.

The contribution of the Stern layer is less well described. It is often called "additional surface conductivity".&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S. and Derjaguin, B.V. "Electrokinetic Phenomena", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the surface conductivity of the diffuse part of the DL was developed by Bikerman.&lt;ref&gt;Bikerman, J.J. Z.Physik.Chem. A163, 378, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; He derived a simple equation that links surface conductivity κ&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; with the behaviour of ions at the interface. For symmetrical electrolyte and assuming identical ions diffusion coefficients D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=D&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;=D it is given in Ref.2:

:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}^{\sigma} = \frac{4F^2Cz^2D(1+3m/z^2)}{RT\kappa}\left(\cosh\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:F is the [[Faraday constant]]
:T is the [[absolute temperature]]
:R is the [[gas constant]]
:C is the ionic concentration in the bulk fluid
:z is the [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
:ζ is the [[electrokinetic potential]]

The parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] to the motion of ions within the DL:
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Dukhin number]] is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the contribution of the surface conductivity to a variety of [[electrokinetic phenomena]], such as, [[electrophoresis]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

==Surface Science==
'''Surface conductivity''' may refer to the electrical conduction across a solid surface measured by surface probes. Experiments may be done to test this material property as in the [[Extrinsic semiconductor|n-type]] surface conductivity of [[Extrinsic semiconductor|p-type]] &lt;ref&gt; W.L. Brown. "n-Type Surface Conductivity on p-Type Germanium". Phys. Rev. 91, 518 (1953). &lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, surface conductivity is measured in coupled phenomena such as [[Photoconductivity|photoconductivity]], for example, for the metal oxide semiconductor [[Zinc oxide|ZnO]]&lt;ref&gt;Y. Shapira, S.M. Cox and David Lichtman. "CHEMISORPTION, PHOTODESORPTION AND CONDUCTIVITY
MEASUREMENTS ON ZnO SURFACES". Surface Science 54, 43 (1976). &lt;/ref&gt;. Surface conductivity differs from bulk conductivity for analogous reasons to the electrolyte solution case, where the [[Charge carrier|charge carriers]] of holes (+1) and electrons (-1) play the role of ions in solution.

{{Anthropology of religion|Basic|image=[[File:Kwakiutl1.jpg|center|255px]]|caption=A [[totem pole]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada}}
A '''totem''' ([[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] ''[[doodem]]'') is a spirit being, sacred object, or symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of [[people]], such as a [[family]], [[clan]], [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]], or [[tribe]].

While the term ''totem'' is derived from the North American [[Ojibwe]] language, belief in [[Tutelary deity|tutelary spirits and deities]] is not limited to [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] but common to a number of cultures worldwide. However, the traditional people of those cultures have words for their guardian spirits in their own languages, and do not call these spirits or symbols "totems".

Contemporary [[Neoshamanism|neoshamanic]], [[New Age]], and [[mythopoetic men's movement]]s not otherwise involved in the practice of a tribal religion have been known to use "totem" terminology for the personal identification with a tutelary spirit or [[Spirit guide|guide]].&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Lisa, "Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality" in: ''The American Indian Quarterly'' 24.3 (2000) pp. 329–352.

===North American totem poles===
{{Main|Totem pole}}
[[Totem pole]]s of the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]] are [[monument]]al poles of [[heraldry]]. They feature many different designs (bears, birds, frogs, people, and various supernatural beings and aquatic creatures) that function as crests of families or chiefs. They recount stories owned by those families or chiefs, or commemorate special occasions.&lt;ref name=GarfieldForrest&gt;{{cite book|author= Viola E. Garfield and Linn A.

==Anthropological perspectives==
[[Image:Totem Park pole 1.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[totem pole]] in Thunderbird Park, [[Victoria, British Columbia]]]]

Totemism is a [[belief]] associated with [[animism|animistic]] religions. The totem is usually an animal or other natural figure that spiritually represents a group of related people such as a clan.

Scottish [[ethnologist]] [[John Ferguson McLennan]], following the vogue of 19th-century research, addressed totemism in a broad perspective in his study ''The Worship of Animals and Plants'' (1869, 1870).&lt;ref name=MacLennan1&gt;MacLennan, J., ''The worship of animals and plants'', ''[[Fortnightly Review]], vol. 6-7 (1869-1870)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Wolfe|title=Settler Colonialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdhnThYIgGAC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=22 December 1998|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-304-70340-1|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan did not seek to explain the specific origin of the totemistic phenomenon but sought to indicate that all of the human race had, in [[ancient times]], gone through a totemistic stage.&lt;ref name=MacLennan1/&gt;

Another Scottish scholar, [[Andrew Lang]], early in the 20th century, advocated a [[Nominalism|nominalistic]] explanation of totemism, namely, that local groups or clans, in selecting a totemistic name from the realm of nature, were reacting to a need to be differentiated.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;Andrew Lang A., ''Method in the Study of Totemism'' (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; If the origin of the name was forgotten, Lang argued, there followed a mystical relationship between the object — from which the name was once derived — and the groups that bore these names. Through nature myths, animals and natural objects were considered as the relatives, patrons, or ancestors of the respective social units.&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt;

British anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] published ''Totemism and Exogamy'' in 1910, a four-volume work based largely on his research among [[Indigenous peoples of Australia]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania|Melanesia]], along with a compilation of the work of other writers in the field.&lt;ref name=Frazer1&gt;''Totemism and Exogamy. A Treatise on Certain Early Forms of Superstition and Society'' (1911-1915)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Russian American ethnologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]], subjected totemistic phenomena to sharp criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenweiser A., ''Totemism; An analytical study'', 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of a French school of sociology, [[Émile Durkheim]], examined totemism from a [[sociological]] and theological point of view, attempting to discover a pure religion in very ancient forms and claimed to see the [[origin of religion]] in totemism.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim E., ''Totémisme'' (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading representative of British social anthropology, [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]], took a totally different view of totemism. Like [[Franz Boas]], he was skeptical that totemism could be described in any unified way. In this he opposed the other pioneer of social anthropology in England, Bronisław Malinowski, who wanted to confirm the unity of totemism in some way and approached the matter more from a biological and psychological point of view than from an ethnological one. According to Malinowski, totemism was not a cultural phenomenon, but rather the result of trying to satisfy basic human needs within the natural world. As far as Radcliffe-Brown was concerned, totemism was composed of elements that were taken from different areas and institutions, and what they have in common is a general tendency to characterize segments of the community through a connection with a portion of nature. In opposition to Durkheim's theory of sacralization, Radcliffe-Brown took the point of view that nature is introduced into the social order rather than secondary to it. At first, he shared with Malinowski the opinion that an animal becomes totemistic when it is “good to eat.” He later came to oppose the usefulness of this viewpoint, since many totems—such as crocodiles and flies—are dangerous and unpleasant.&lt;ref name=Radcliffe-Brown1&gt;Radcliffe-Brown A., ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

As a chief representative of modern [[structuralism]], French ethnologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and his, ''Le Totémisme aujourd'hui'' ("Totemism Today" [1958])&lt;ref name=L-S1&gt;(Lévi-Strauss C., ''Le Totémisme aujourd'hui''(1958); english  trans.  as  ''Totemism'', by [[Rodney Needham]]. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; are often cited in the field.

===Literature===
Poets, and to a lesser extent fiction writers, often use anthropological concepts, including the anthropological understanding of totemism. For this reason literary criticism often resorts to psychoanalytic, anthropological analyses.&lt;ref name=Maryniak&gt;Maryniak, Irena. Spirit of the Totem: Religion and Myth in Soviet Fiction, 1964-1988, MHRA, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Henk de. Freud's Theory and Its Use in Literary and Cultural Studies: An Introduction.

[[File:EarthTransit2084.jpg|thumb|Earth and Moon transiting the Sun in 2084, as seen from Mars. Image created using JPL Solar System Simulator&lt;!--In case we reach 2084 and can't get an image :) --&gt;]]
[[File:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|thumb|Earth and Moon from Mars, as photographed by the [[Mars Global Surveyor]]]]

A '''[[astronomical transit|transit]] of Earth across the Sun as seen from Mars''' takes place when the planet [[Earth]] passes directly between the [[Sun]] and [[Mars]], obscuring a small part of the Sun's disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Earth would be visible from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. They occur every 26, 79 and 100 years, and every 1,000 years or so there is an extra 53rd-year transit.

==Conjunctions==
Transits of Earth from Mars usually occur in pairs, with one following the other after 79 years; rarely, there are three in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its [[ascending node]] are in May, those at [[descending node]] happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 [[synodic period]]s, and is analogous to the cycle of [[transit of Venus|transits of Venus from Earth]], which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.

==View from Mars==
No one has ever seen a transit of Earth from Mars, but the next transit will take place on November 10, 2084.&lt;ref name="Mars2084"/&gt; The last such transit took place on May 11, 1984.&lt;ref name="Earth1984"/&gt;

During the event, the [[Moon]] could almost always  also be seen in transit, although due to the distance between Earth and Moon, sometimes one body completes the transit before the other begins (this last occurred in the 1800 transit, and will happen again in 2394).

==View from Earth==
A transit of Earth from Mars corresponds to Mars being perfectly uniformly illuminated at [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] from Earth, its phase being 180.0° without any [[defect of illumination]]. During the 1879 event, this permitted [[Charles Augustus Young]] to attempt a careful measurement of the [[oblateness]] (polar compression) of Mars. He obtained the value 1/219, or 0.0046. This is close to the modern value of 1/154 (many sources will cite somewhat different values, such as 1/193, because even a difference of only a couple of kilometers in the values of Mars' polar and equatorial radii gives a considerably different result).

Much more recently, better measurements of the oblateness of Mars have been made by using [[radar]] from the Earth. Also, better measurements have been made by using artificial satellites that have been put into orbit around Mars, including ''[[Mariner 9]]'', ''[[Viking 1]]'', ''[[Viking 2]]'', and Soviet orbiters, and the more recent orbiters that have been sent from the Earth to Mars.

==In science fiction==
A [[science fiction]] short story published in 1971 by [[Arthur C. Clarke]],  called "Transit of Earth", depicts a doomed astronaut on Mars observing the transit in 1984. This short story was first published in the January 1971 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.

==Grazing and simultaneous transits==
Sometimes Earth only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of Mars a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 30 April 1211, and the next such transit will occur on 27 November [[5th millennium|4356]]. It is also possible that a transit of Earth can be seen in some parts of Mars as a partial transit, while in others Earth misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 26 October 664, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December [[6th millennium|5934]].

The simultaneous occurrence of a [[Transit of Venus from Mars|transit of Venus]] and a transit of Earth is extremely rare, and will next occur in the year [[Timeline of the far future#Astronomical events|571,471]].

'''Uniformitarianism,''' also known as the '''Doctrine of Uniformity,'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|1866|pp=551-513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gould1965&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1965|pp=223–228}}, "''The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference'' which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is ''the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science.  Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown'' and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations."&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the invariance in the principles underpinning science, such as the constancy of [[causality]], or causation, throughout time,&lt;ref&gt;[[#gord|Gordon, 2013]]: 82; "The uniformitarian principle assumes that ''the behavior of nature is regular and indicative of an objective causal structure in which presently operative causes may be projected into the past'' to explain the historical development of the physical world and projected into the future for the purposes of prediction and control. In short, it involves the process of inferring past causes from presently observable effects under the assumption that ''the fundamental causal regularities of the world have not changed over time''."&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been used to describe invariance of [[physical laws]] through time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A.N. 1987. Science and Earth History- The Evolution/Creation Controversy, Prometheus Books, Amherst, New York, USA. p. 194: “Under the updated statement of a useful principle of uniformitarianism it boils down essentially to ''affirmation of the validity of universal scientific laws through time and space'', coupled with a rejection of supernatural causes.” p. 62: “In cosmology, the study of the structure and evolution of the universe, ''it is assumed that the laws of physics are similar throughout the entire universe''.”&lt;/ref&gt; Though an unprovable [[postulate]] that cannot be verified using the scientific method, uniformitarianism has been a key [[first principle]] of virtually all fields of science.&lt;ref name=simpson1963&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}, "''Uniformity is an unprovable postulate'' justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, ''only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible'', and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]], uniformitarianism has included the [[gradualism|gradualistic]] concept that "the present is the key to the past" (that events occur at the same rate now as they have always done); many geologists now, however, no longer hold to a strict theory of gradualism.&lt;ref&gt;FARIA, Felipe.

Hutton's work was later refined by scientist [[John Playfair]] and popularised by geologist [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/uniformitarianism |title=Uniformitarianism: World of Earth Science|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Earth's history is considered to have been a slow, gradual process, punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events.

==History==

===18th century===

[[Image:Siccar point SE cliff.jpg|thumb|Cliff at the east of [[Siccar Point]] in Berwickshire, showing the near-horizontal red sandstone layers above vertically tilted greywacke rocks.]]

The earlier conceptions{{which|date=July 2016}} likely{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} had little influence on 18th-century European geological explanations for the formation of Earth.  [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) proposed [[Neptunism]], where [[stratum|strata]] represented deposits from shrinking seas [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] onto primordial rocks such as [[granite]]. In 1785 [[James Hutton]] proposed an opposing, self-maintaining infinite cycle based on natural history and not on the [[Bible|Biblical]] account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=57–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hutton, J. |date=1785 |url=http://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/geography/hutton/Abstract-facsimile/abstract1.htm |title=Abstract, The System of the Earth, Its Duration and Stability |quote=As ''it is not in human record, but in natural history'', that we are to look for the means of ascertaining what has already been, it is here proposed to examine the appearances of the earth, in order to be informed of operations which have been transacted in time past.  It is thus that, from principles of natural philosophy, ''we may arrive at some knowledge'' of order and system in the economy of this globe, and may ''form a rational opinion'' with regard to the course of nature, or to events which are in time to happen. |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907225227/http://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/geography/hutton/Abstract-facsimile/abstract1.htm |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The solid parts of the present land appear in general, to have been composed of the productions of the sea, and of other materials similar to those now found upon the shores. Hence we find reason to conclude:&lt;br&gt;

:2nd, That before the present land was made, there had subsisted a world composed of sea and land, in which were tides and currents, with such operations at the bottom of the sea as now take place. And,
:Lastly, That while the present land was forming at the bottom of the ocean, the former land maintained plants and animals; at least the sea was then inhabited by animals, in a similar manner as it is at present.
Hence we are led to conclude, that the greater part of our land, if not the whole had been produced by operations natural to this globe; but that in order to make this land a permanent body, resisting the operations of the waters, two things had been required;&lt;br&gt;

Hutton then sought evidence to support his idea that there must have been repeated cycles, each involving [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] on the [[seabed]], uplift with tilting and [[erosion]], and then moving undersea again for further layers to be deposited. At [[Glen Tilt]] in the [[Cairngorms|Cairngorm mountains]] he found granite penetrating [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[schist]]s, in a way which indicated to him that the presumed primordial rock had been [[molten]] after the strata had formed.&lt;ref name="Macfarlane"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200309/ai_n9253355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101110825/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200309/ai_n9253355 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 November 2007 |title=Glimpses into the abyss of time |author=Robert Macfarlane |work=[[The Spectator]] |publisher=Review of Repcheck's ''The Man Who Found Time'' |date=13 September 2003 |quote=Hutton possessed an instinctive ability to reverse physical processes – to read landscapes backwards, as it were.

Both Playfair and Hall wrote their own books on the theory, and for decades robust debate continued between Hutton's supporters and the Neptunists. [[Georges Cuvier]]'s [[history of paleontology|paleontological work]] in the 1790s, which established the reality of [[extinction]], explained this by local catastrophes, after which other fixed species repopulated the affected areas. In Britain, geologists adapted this idea into "[[Diluvium|diluvial theory]]" which proposed repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the [[Deluge (mythology)|biblical flood]].&lt;ref&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Lyell 1840.jpg|upright|thumb|Charles Lyell at the [[British Association]] meeting in Glasgow 1840]]
From 1830 to 1833 [[Charles Lyell]]'s multi-volume ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' was published. The work's subtitle was "An attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation". He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Leonard G. "Charles Lyell" ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography''. Ed. Charles Coulston Gillispie. Vol. VIII. Pennsylvania, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; and developed Hutton's idea that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. The terms ''uniformitarianism'' for this idea, and ''[[catastrophism]]'' for the opposing viewpoint, were coined by [[William Whewell]] in a review of Lyell's book. ''Principles of Geology'' was the  most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century.

====Systems of inorganic earth history====

Geoscientists support diverse systems of Earth history, the nature of which rest on a certain mixture of views about process, control, rate, and state which are preferred. Because geologists and geomorphologists tend to adopt opposite views over process, rate and state in the inorganic world, there are eight different systems of beliefs in the development of the terrestrial sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggett|first= Richard|year=1990|title =Catastophism: Systems of Earth History|publisher=Edward Arnold|location= London| page=34|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All geoscientists stand by the principle of uniformity of law. Most, but not all, are directed by the principle of simplicity. All make definite assertions about the quality of rate and state in the inorganic realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggett|first= Richard|year=1990|title =Catastophism: Systems of Earth History|publisher=Edward Arnold|location= London| page=33|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lyell's uniformitarianism====
According to [[Reijer Hooykaas]] (1963), Lyell's uniformitarianism is a family of four related propositions, not a single idea:&lt;ref&gt;Reijer Hooykaas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TgYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1 ''Natural Law and Divine Miracle: The Principle of Uniformity in Geology, Biology, and Theology''], Leiden: [[EJ Brill]], 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uniformity of law – the laws of nature are constant across time and space.
* Uniformity of methodology – the appropriate hypotheses for explaining the geological past are those with analogy today.
* Uniformity of kind – past and present causes are all of the same kind, have the same energy, and produce the same effects.
* Uniformity of degree – geological circumstances have remained the same over time.

None of these connotations requires another, and they are not all equally inferred by uniformitarians.&lt;ref&gt;David Cahan, 2003, ''From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences'', p 95 {{ISBN|978-0-226-08928-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] explained Lyell's propositions in ''[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]'' (1987), stating that Lyell conflated two different types of propositions: a pair of '''''methodological assumptions''''' with a pair of '''''substantive hypotheses'''''. The four together make up Lyell's uniformitarianism.&lt;ref name=Gould118&gt;{{cite book

=====Methodological assumptions=====
The two methodological assumptions below are accepted to be true by the majority of scientists and geologists. Gould claims that these philosophical propositions must be assumed before you can proceed as a scientist doing science.  "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes.  It works the other way around." You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the outcrop."&lt;ref name=Gould120&gt;{{cite book

:* '''Uniformity of law across time and space''':  Natural laws are constant across space and time.&lt;ref name=gould1987 /&gt;
::The axiom of uniformity of law &lt;ref name="gould1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simpson1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gould1987&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=119}}, "''Making inferences about the past is wrapped up in the difference between studying the observable and the unobservable.'' In the observable, erroneous beliefs can be proven wrong and be inductively corrected by other observations. This is Popper's principle of [[falsifiability]]. However, ''past processes are not observable by their very nature.'' Therefore, '''the invariance of nature's laws must be assumed to come to conclusions about the past.''"&lt;/ref&gt; is necessary in order for scientists to extrapolate (by inductive inference) into the unobservable past.&lt;ref name=gould1965 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gould1987 /&gt;  The constancy of natural laws must be assumed in the study of the past; else we cannot meaningfully study it.&lt;ref name=gould1965 /&gt;&lt;ref name=simpson1963 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gould1987 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hutton|1795|p=297}}, "If the stone, for example, which fell today, were to rise again tomorrow, there would be an end of natural philosophy [i.e., science], ''our principles would fail, and we would no longer investigate the rules of nature from our observations''."&lt;/ref&gt;

:* '''Uniformity of process across time and space''':  Natural processes are constant across time and space.

::Though similar to uniformity of law, this second ''a priori'' assumption, shared by the vast majority of scientists, deals with geological causes, not physico-chemical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1984|p=11}},  "As such, it is another ''a priori'' methodological assumption shared by most scientists and not a statement about the empirical world."&lt;/ref&gt;  The past is to be explained by processes acting currently in time and space rather than inventing extra esoteric or unknown processes ''without good reason'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=120}},"We should try to explain the past by causes now in operation without inventing extra, fancy, or unknown causes, however plausible in logic, if available processes suffice."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooykaas|1963|p=38}}, ="Strict uniformitarianism may often be a guarantee against pseudo-scientific phantasies and loose conjectures, but it makes one easily forget that the principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a methodological principle, preceding the observation of facts . . . It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for there is only one way in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different."&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known  as parsimony or [[Occam's razor]].

=====Substantive hypotheses=====
The substantive hypotheses were controversial and, in some cases, accepted by few.&lt;ref name=Gould118 /&gt;  These hypotheses are judged true or false on empirical grounds through scientific observation and repeated experimental data. This is in contrast with the previous two philosophical assumptions&lt;ref name="Gould120" /&gt; that come before one can do science and so cannot be tested or falsified by science.

:* '''Uniformity of rate across time and space''':  Change is typically slow, steady, and gradual.&lt;ref name="Gould120" /&gt;

::Uniformity of rate (or [[gradualism]]) is what most people (including geologists) think of when they hear the word "uniformitarianism," confusing this hypothesis with the entire definition.  As late as 1990, Lemon, in his textbook of stratigraphy, affirmed that "The uniformitarian view of earth history held that all geologic processes proceed continuously and at a very slow pace."&lt;ref&gt;Lemon, R. R. 1990. ''Principles of stratigraphy''. Columbus, Ohio: Merrill Publishing Company. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

::Gould explained Hutton's view of uniformity of rate; mountain ranges or grand canyons are built by accumulation of nearly insensible changes added up through vast time.  Some major events such as floods, earthquakes, and eruptions, do occur.  But these catastrophes are strictly local.  They neither occurred in the past, nor shall happen in the future, at any greater frequency or extent than they display at present. In particular, the whole earth is never convulsed at once.&lt;ref name=Gould120s&gt;{{cite book

::The uniformity of state hypothesis implies that throughout the history of our earth there is no progress in any inexorable direction. The planet has almost always looked and behaved as it does now.  Change is continuous, but leads nowhere. The earth is in balance: a dynamic [[steady state]].&lt;ref name=Gould123 /&gt;

===20th century===
[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s first scientific paper, ''Is uniformitarianism necessary?'' (1965), reduced these four assumptions to two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gould | first1 = S. J. | date = 1965 | title = Is uniformitarianism necessary? | url = http://www.ajsonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/263/3/223 | journal = American Journal of Science | volume = 263 | pages = 223–228 | doi=10.2475/ajs.263.3.223| bibcode = 1965AmJS..263..223G }}&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed the first principle, which asserted spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws, as no longer an issue of debate. He rejected the third (uniformity of rate) as an unjustified limitation on scientific inquiry, as it constrains past geologic rates and conditions to those of the present. So, Lyellian uniformitarianism was unnecessary.

Uniformitarianism was proposed in contrast to [[catastrophism]], which states that the distant past "consisted of epochs of paroxysmal and catastrophic action interposed between periods of comparative tranquility"&lt;ref&gt;William J. Whewell, ''Principles of Geology'', Charles Leyell, vol. II, London, 1832: Quart. Rev., v. 47, p. 103-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most geologists took this interpretation to mean that catastrophic events are not important in geologic time; one example of this is the debate of the formation of the [[Channeled Scablands]] due to the catastrophic [[Missoula floods|Missoula]] glacial outburst floods. An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, E. A., et al., 1986, Cataclysms on the Columbia, Timber Press, Portland, OR. {{ISBN|978-0-88192-067-3}}

* "Bretz knew that the very idea of catastrophic flooding would threaten and anger ''the geological community''.  And here's why: among geologists in the 1920s, catastrophic explanations for geological events (other than volcanos or earthquakes) were considered wrong minded to the point of heresy."  p. 42.
* "Consider, then, what Bretz was up against.  The very word 'Catastrophism' was heinous in the ears of geologists. ... It was a step backwards, a betrayal of ''all that geological science had fought to gain''.  It was heresy of the worst order."  p. 44
* "It was inevitable that sooner or later ''the geological community would rise up'' and attempt to defeat Bretz's 'outrageous hypothesis.'" p 49
* "Nearly 50 years had passed since Bretz first proposed the idea of catastorphic flooding, and now in 1971 ''his arguments had become a standard of geological thinking''." p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;
Derek Ager has noted that "geologists do not deny uniformitarianism in its true sense, that is to say, of interpreting the past by means of the processes that are seen going on at the present day, so long as we remember that the periodic catastrophe is one of those processes.  Those periodic catastrophes make more showing in the stratigraphical record than we have hitherto assumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Even [[Charles Lyell]] thought that ordinary geological processes would cause [[Niagara Falls]] to move upstream to [[Lake Erie]] within 10,000 years, leading to catastrophic flooding of a large part of North America.

Modern geologists do not apply uniformitarianism in the same way as Lyell.  They question if rates of processes were uniform through time and only those values measured during the history of geology are to be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"By force of popularity, uniformity of rate has persisted to our present day.  For more than a century, Lyell's rhetoric conflating axiom with hypotheses has descended in unmodified form.  Many geologists have been stifled by the belief that proper methodology includes an a priori commitment to gradual change, and by a preference for explaining large-scale phenomena as the concatenation of innumerable tiny changes."&lt;ref name=Gould174&gt;{{cite book

The current consensus is that [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] is a slow, gradual process punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia Sixth Edition, ''[http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html uniformitarianism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624122338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |date=2006-06-24 }}'' © 2007 Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice it is reduced from Lyell's conflation, or blending, to simply the two philosophical assumptions.  This is also known as the principle of geological actualism, which states that all past geological action was like all present geological action. The principle of [[actualism]] is the cornerstone of [[paleoecology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In [[astrobiology]], the '''Uniformity of Motive''' theory suggests that any civilization in the [[universe]] would go through similar technological steps in their development. This theory supports the idea that at some point in their history, advanced alien civilizations would use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] medium for communications, and thus would emit radio waves that could be detected by projects such as [[SETI]].

The fact that no artificial EM band communications have ever been detected supports the [[Fermi Principle]], which in conjunction with the Uniformity of Motive theory, and [[Occam's razor]] suggests that a civilization that uses this medium is a unique occurrence in Earth's region of the Milky Way Galaxy and perhaps the universe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9020">'''Weather risk management''' is a type of [[risk management]] done by organizations to address potential financial losses caused by unusual weather.

==Overview==
Energy, agriculture, transportation, construction, municipalities, school districts, travel, food processors, retail sales and real estate are all examples of industries whose operations and profits can be significantly affected by the weather.  For example, unusually mild winters diminish consumer demand for heating and erode the profit margins for utility companies.  Unexpected weather events can cause significant financial losses. Weather information and forecasts utilized in risk management decision making is often referred to as [[meteorological intelligence]] and offered by companies such as [[Delphi Weather Analytics]].

The weather risk market makes it possible to manage the financial impact of weather through risk transfer instruments based on a defined weather element, such as temperature, rain, snow, wind, etc.  Weather risk management is a way for organizations to limit their financial exposure to disruptive weather events. By making a payment (a "premium") to a separate company that will assume the financial weather risk for them, an organization essentially is buying a type of insurance - the company assuming the risk will pay the buyer a pre-set amount of money which will correspond to the loss or cost increase caused by the disruptive weather.

Catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes are typically managed through traditional insurance contracts that pay based on indemnity loss.   Insurance is a heavily regulated industry with specific requirements and qualification criteria.  Due to the indemnity nature of insurance, actual loss must be proven to an insurance carrier before the payment can be processed.  In contrast, financial loss such as erosion of margin, portfolio loss or increased expenses usually do not qualify for insurance payouts.  Financial instruments such as derivative transactions can provide more flexible and customized risk management opportunities than the typical insurance contracts as they are priced and settled on the parameters of measured weather rather than the associated financial loss.

==Market participants==
A wide range of capital providers make markets in weather risk.  To date the weather risk management trading market is primarily made up of dedicated weather trading operations, such as Nephila Capital Ltd, [[Galileo Weather Risk Management Advisors LCC]], Swiss Re, RenRe, and [[Coriolis Capital]], who execute trade orders in weather or weather-contingent commodity trades, the trading desks of financial institutions and utilities, such as Susquahanna Energy and Aquila who hedge their own risk as well as speculative trades for a merchant portfolio, professional commodity traders, such as RJO and hedge and private equity funds such as Tudor Capital.  Transactions can be effected [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) or on commodity exchanges such as The [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME).  Still other operations, such as [[Storm Exchange|Storm Exchange, Inc]](Note: Storm Exchange is now defunct. and [[Weatherbill|WeatherBill]] (WeatherBill is no longer serving markets outside of Agriculture), privately held eWeatherRisk now provide corporate and municipal clients with the necessary financial context to gauge the impact of the weather on profit and loss before executing trades either OTC or through the CME.

==Regulation==
===United States===
In the US, the [[Commodity Exchange Act]], Section 5d establishes weather in a category of market exempt from Commission oversight.

Rule 36.2 defines those commodities that are eligible to trade on an exempt board of trade as commodities having:
#A nearly inexhaustible deliverable supply;
#A deliverable supply that is sufficiently large, and a cash market sufficiently liquid, to render any contract traded on the commodity highly unlikely to be susceptible to the threat of manipulation;
#No cash market.
The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] determined that weather indices are eligible to be traded on EBOTs by order dated May 30, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cftc.gov/stellent/groups/public/@iodtefs/documents/file/deawiebots05-02.pdf |title=CFTC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917231534/http://cftc.gov/stellent/groups/public/@iodtefs/documents/file/deawiebots05-02.pdf |archivedate=September 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax treatment==
===Accounting for OTC weather derivatives as a hedge===
Companies that are subject to public disclosure to regulators or their shareholders must demonstrate that the purchase or a sale of a derivatives is true and fair hedge, not speculation. SFAS 133 and IAS provide guidelines on the steps that are required.  FAS 133 Accounting for [[Weather Derivatives]]: For U.S. accounting standards, Over-the-Counter (OTC) weather derivative transactions can generally get an exemption under derivatives &amp; hedging disclosure rules of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risklimited.net/fas133-summary.htm|title=FAS 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; section 10 for non-exchange contracts settled on climatic variables, although specific structures and applications have to be assessed for each company environment. All written non–exchanged–traded option–based [[weather derivatives]] contracts should be carried at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value reported in current earnings.

===Accounting for Exchange traded and speculative weather derivatives===
When they are standardized and traded on exchanges, weather derivatives will fall within the scope of SFAS 133. EITF Issue No 99–2 "Accounting for weather derivatives" provides guidance on accounting for weather derivatives that are not exchange–traded. Entities that enter into speculatives or trading non–exchange derivatives contracts should apply the intrinsic method.

The most common cause of wildfires varies throughout the world. In Canada and northwest China, lightning operates as the major source of ignition. In other parts of the world, human involvement is a major contributor. In Africa, Central America, Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia, wildfires can be attributed to human activities such as agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and land-conversion burning. In China and in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], human carelessness is a major cause of wildfires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhihua|last2=Yang|first2=Jian|last3=Chang|first3=Yu|last4=Weisberg|first4=Peter J.|last5=He|first5=Hong S.|date=June 2012|title=Spatial patterns and drivers of fire occurrence and its future trend under climate change in a boreal forest of Northeast China|journal=Global Change Biology|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=2041–2056|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02649.x|issn=1354-1013|bibcode=2012GCBio..18.2041L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Rigo|first=Daniele|last2=Libertà|first2=Giorgio|last3=Houston Durrant|first3=Tracy|last4=Artés Vivancos|first4=Tomàs|last5=San-Miguel-Ayanz|first5=Jesús|title=Forest fire danger extremes in Europe under climate change: variability and uncertainty|page=71|date=2017|publisher=Publication Office of the European Union|location=Luxembourg|isbn=978-92-79-77046-3|doi=10.2760/13180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Australia, the source of wildfires can be traced both to lightning strikes and to human activities (such as machinery sparks, cast-away cigarette butts, or [[arson]]).&lt;ref name="Krock"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|title=The World on Fire|last=Krock|first=Lexi|date=June 2002|publisher=NOVA online – Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=13 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027041902/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fire/world.html|archivedate=27 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balch|first=Jennifer K.|last2=Bradley|first2=Bethany A.|last3=Abatzoglou|first3=John T.|last4=Nagy|first4=R.

The spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present, its vertical arrangement and moisture content, and weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., iv"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., iv.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by [[topography]], as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth. Overall, fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows: 
* '''Ground''' fires are fed by subterranean roots, [[forest floor|duff]] and other buried [[organic matter]]. This fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting. Ground fires typically burn by smoldering, and can burn slowly for days to months, such as [[Peat#Peat Fires|peat fires]] in [[Kalimantan]] and Eastern [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], which resulted from a [[Mega Rice Project (Kalimantan)|riceland creation project]] that unintentionally drained and dried the peat.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 9, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | title = Asian peat fires add to warming | publisher = British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) News | last = Rincon | first = Paul | date = 9 March 2005 | accessdate = 9 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219064000/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4208564.stm | archivedate = 19 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Crawling''' or '''surface''' fires are fueled by low-lying vegetation on the [[forest floor]] such as leaf and timber litter, debris, grass, and low-lying shrubbery.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al'' ., iv, 10, 14&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of fire often burns at a relatively lower temperature than crown fires (less than {{convert|400|C|F}}) and may spread at slow rate, though steep slopes and wind can accelerate the rate of spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fire on earth : an introduction|last=C.|first=Scott, Andrew|others=Bowman, D.

* '''Ladder''' fires consume material between low-level vegetation and tree canopies, such as small trees, downed logs, and [[vine]]s.

* '''Crown''', '''canopy''', or '''aerial''' fires burn suspended material at the canopy level, such as tall trees, vines, and mosses. The ignition of a crown fire, termed ''crowning'', is dependent on the density of the suspended material, canopy height, canopy continuity, sufficient surface and ladder fires, vegetation moisture content, and weather conditions during the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., iv, 8, 11, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Stand-replacing fires lit by humans can spread into the [[Amazon rain forest]], damaging ecosystems not particularly suited for heat or arid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2010|title=Global Commodities Boom Fuels New Assault on Amazon|last=Butler|first=Rhett|publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|accessdate=9 July 2009|date=19 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411124535/http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2010|archivedate=11 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfires occur when all of the necessary elements of a [[fire triangle]] come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as [[vegetation]], that is subjected to sufficient heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air. A high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation, because higher temperatures are required to evaporate any water within the material and heat the material to its [[fire point]].&lt;ref name = FireBehavior/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIFC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|title=The Science of Wildland fire|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|accessdate=21 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105175208/http://www.nifc.gov/preved/comm_guide/wildfire/fire_4.html|archivedate=5 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense forests usually provide more shade, resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater [[humidity]], and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., 12"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants continuously lose water by [[evapotranspiration]], but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil, humidity, or rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | title = Ashes cover areas hit by Southern Calif. fires | agency = Associated Press | publisher = MSNBC | date = 15 November 2008 | accessdate = 4 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081209033149/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27148069/ | archivedate = 9 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out and are therefore more flammable, often a consequence of droughts.&lt;ref name=Structure&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | title = Influence of Forest Structure on Wildfire Behavior and the Severity of Its Effects | date = November 2003 | format = PDF | publisher = US Forest Service | accessdate = 19 November 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217125731/http://www.fs.fed.us/projects/hfi/2003/november/documents/forest-structure-wildfire.pdf | archivedate = 17 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | title = Prepare for a Wildfire | publisher = Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) | accessdate = 1 December 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029025706/https://www.fema.gov/hazard/wildfire/wf_prepare.shtm | archivedate = 29 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wildfire ''front'' is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or the [[smolder]]ing transition between unburned and burned material.&lt;ref&gt;''Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; As the front approaches, the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through [[convection]] and [[thermal radiation]].

Especially large wildfires may affect air currents in their immediate vicinities by the [[stack effect]]: air rises as it is heated, and large wildfires create powerful [[updraft]]s that will [[advection|draw in]] new, cooler air from surrounding areas in [[thermal column]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''National Wildfire Coordinating Group Communicator's Guide For Wildland Fire Management'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Great vertical differences in temperature and humidity encourage [[pyrocumulus cloud]]s, strong winds, and [[fire whirl]]s with the force of tornadoes at speeds of more than {{convert|80|km/h|mph|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''et al.'', 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/newshelt72.pdf | format = PDF | title = The New Generation Fire Shelter | page = 19 | publisher = National Wildfire Coordinating Group | date = March 2003 | accessdate = 16 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090116133450/http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/newshelt72.pdf | archivedate = 16 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapid rates of spread, prolific crowning or spotting, the presence of fire whirls, and strong convection columns signify extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''Glossary of Wildland Fire Terminology'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermal heat from wildfire can cause significant [[weathering]] of rocks and boulders, heat can rapidly expand a boulder and [[thermal shock]] can occur, which may cause an object's structure to fail.

Intensity also increases during daytime hours. Burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds.&lt;ref&gt;de Souza Costa and Sandberg, 228&lt;/ref&gt; Sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates air currents that travel uphill.

Wildfire's occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry, hot periods.&lt;ref name=NOVA /&gt; Such places include the vegetated areas of Australia and [[Southeast Asia]], the [[veld]] in southern Africa, the [[fynbos]] in the Western Cape of South Africa, the forested areas of the United States and Canada, and the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

High-severity wildfire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat (also called “snag forest habitat”), which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Plant and animal species in most types of North American forests evolved with fire, and many of these species depend on wildfires, and particularly high-severity fires, to reproduce and grow. Fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil, the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds, and the snags (dead trees) and early successional forests created by high-severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Early successional forests created by high-severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donato|first=Daniel C.|last2=Fontaine|first2=Joseph B.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Although some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth, some ecosystems suffer from too much fire, such as the [[chaparral]] in [[southern California]] and lower-elevation deserts in the American Southwest.

{{Main|Fire adaptations}}
Plants in wildfire-prone [[ecosystems]] often survive through adaptations to their local [[fire regime]]. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate [[competition]]. For example, plants of the genus ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard [[sclerophyll]] leaves to resist heat and drought, ensuring their dominance over less fire-tolerant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | title=Section Three: Problems, Cares, Economics, and Species | work=The Eucalyptus of California | first=Robert L. | last=Santos | publisher=California State University | date=1997 | accessdate=26 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602175115/http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/section3.htm | archivedate=2 June 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fire.

In the [[Welsh Borders]], the first evidence of wildfire is [[Rhyniophyta|rhyniophytoid]] plant fossils preserved as [[charcoal]], dating to the [[Silurian]] period (about {{ma|420}}).

Wildfires during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times. Surface fires driven by dry seasons{{clarify|does this mean annual dry seasons or erratic droughts?|date=October 2015}} are evident in Devonian and Carboniferous [[progymnosperm]] forests.  [[Lepidodendron]] forests dating to the Carboniferous period have charred peaks, evidence of crown fires.

As these grasses shifted to more [[mesic habitat]]s, their high flammability increased fire frequency, promoting grasslands over woodlands.&lt;ref&gt;Pausas and Keeley, 595&lt;/ref&gt; However, fire-prone habitats may have contributed to the prominence of trees such as those of the genera ''[[Eucalyptus]]'', ''Pinus'' and ''[[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]]'', which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ [[serotiny]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausas and Keeley, 596&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought. An increase in fire-related [[debris flow]] in [[alluvial fan]]s of northeastern [[Yellowstone National Park]] was linked to the period between AD 1050 and 1200, coinciding with the [[Medieval Warm Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=G.A. |last2=Wells |first2=S.G.|last3=Jull|first3=A.J.T.|date=1995|title=Fire and alluvial chronology in Yellowstone National Park: Climatic and intrinsic controls on Holocene geomorphic processes|journal=GSA Bulletin|issue=10|pages=1211–1230 |doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107&lt;1211:FAACIY&gt;2.3.CO;2 |volume= 107 |bibcode = 1995GSAB..107.1211M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, human influence caused an increase in fire frequency. [[Dendrochronological]] fire scar data and charcoal layer data in [[Finland]] suggests that, while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions, an increase in the number of fires during 850 BC and 1660 AD can be attributed to human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pitkänen, ''et al.'', 15–16 and 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal evidence from the Americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1 AD and 1750 compared to previous years. However, a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from North America and Asia, attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices. This period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century, linked to the expansion of agriculture, increased livestock grazing, and fire prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n10/full/ngeo313.html |title=Climate and human influences on global biomass burning over the past two millennia |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |pages=697–702 |date=2008 |doi=10.1038/ngeo313 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..697M |author=J.

Researchers explain this a transition from [[nomadism]] to settled lifestyle and intensification of [[agriculture]] that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land clearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90493|title= Researchers Detect a Global Drop in Fires|author= &lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date= June 30, 2017|website= [[NASA Earth Observatory]]|publisher= |access-date= July 4, 2017|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175626/https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90493|archivedate= 8 December 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Andela|first1= N.|last2= Morton|first2= D.C.|display-authors= etal|date= June 30, 2017|title= A human-driven decline in global burned area|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1356|journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume= 356|issue= 6345|pages= 1356–1362|doi= 10.1126/science.aal4108|pmid= 28663495|pmc= 6047075|access-date= July 4, 2017|bibcode= 2017Sci...356.1356A|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170702220009/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1356|archivedate= 2 July 2017|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases of certain native tree species (i.e. [[conifers]]) in favor of others (i.e. leaf trees) also increases wildfire risk, especially if these trees are also planted in [[monoculture]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-07-biodiversity-criticism-sweden-forest-industry.html Fires spark biodiversity criticism of Sweden's forest industry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BE6B5/(httpNews)/531DAFFB8B319F69C125792E00499ED1 The Great Lie: Monoculture Trees as Forests]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[invasive species]], moved in by humans (i.e., for the [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper industry]]) have in some cases also increased the intensity of wildfires. Examples include species such as [[Eucalyptus]] in California&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.sc.us/forest/scplants.pdf Plant flammability list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.firesafemarin.org/plants/fire-prone Fire-prone plant list]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gamba grass]] in Australia.

Wildfire prevention refers to the preemptive methods aimed at reducing the risk of fires as well as lessening its severity and spread.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention techniques aim to manage air quality, maintain ecological balances, protect resources,&lt;ref name="van Wagtendonk, 14"/&gt; and to affect future fires.&lt;ref&gt;van Wagtendonk (1996), 1156.&lt;/ref&gt; North American firefighting policies permit naturally caused fires to burn to maintain their ecological role, so long as the risks of escape into high-value areas are mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;''Interagency Strategy for the Implementation of the Federal Wildland Fire Policy'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prevention policies must consider the role that humans play in wildfires, since, for example, 95% of forest fires in Europe are related to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;San-Miguel-Ayanz, ''et al.'', 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of human-caused fire may include arson, accidental ignition, or the uncontrolled use of fire in land-clearing and agriculture such as the slash-and-burn farming in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 7, 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] initiated a nationwide fire prevention campaign, highlighting the role of human carelessness in forest fires. Later posters of the program featured [[Uncle Sam]], characters from the Disney movie ''[[Bambi]]'', and the official mascot of the [[U.S. Forest Service]], [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smokeybear.com/vault/default.asp?js=1 | title=Smokey's Journey | publisher=Smokeybear.com | accessdate=26 January 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306051136/http://www.smokeybear.com/vault/default.asp?js=1 | archivedate=6 March 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing human-caused ignitions may be the most effective means of reducing unwanted wildfire.

Vegetation may be burned periodically to maintain high species diversity and frequent burning of surface fuels limits fuel accumulation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''Fire. The Australian Experience'', 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Graham, ''et al''., 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Wildland fire use is the cheapest and most ecologically appropriate policy for many forests.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Fuels may also be removed by logging, but fuels treatments and thinning have no effect on severe fire behavior&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Wildfire models are often used to predict and compare the benefits of different fuel treatments on future wildfire spread, but their accuracy is low.&lt;ref name="Graham, et al., iv" /&gt;

Wildfire itself is reportedly "the most effective treatment for reducing a fire's rate of spread, fireline intensity, flame length, and heat per unit of area" according to Jan van Wagtendonk, a biologist at the Yellowstone Field Station.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;van Wagtendonk (1996), 1164&lt;/ref&gt;

Building codes in fire-prone areas typically require that structures be built of flame-resistant materials and a [[defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the structure.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fire.ca.gov/fire_prevention/downloads/FHSZBSR_Backgrounder.pdf | format = PDF | title = California's Fire Hazard Severity Zone Update and Building Standards Revision | publisher = CAL FIRE | date = May 2007 | accessdate = 18 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090226080558/http://www.fire.ca.gov/fire_prevention/downloads/FHSZBSR_Backgrounder.pdf | archivedate = 26 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_1551-1600/sb_1595_bill_20080927_chaptered.pdf | format = PDF | title = California Senate Bill No. 1595, Chapter 366 | publisher = State of California | date = 27 September 2008 | accessdate = 18 December 2008 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120658/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/sen/sb_1551-1600/sb_1595_bill_20080927_chaptered.pdf | archivedate = 30 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities in the [[Philippines]] also maintain [[fire line]]s {{convert|5|to|10|m|sp=us|ft}} wide between the forest and their village, and patrol these lines during summer months or seasons of dry weather.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Continued residential development in fire-prone areas and rebuilding structures destroyed by fires has been met with criticism.&lt;ref name="Trial2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.onearth.org/article/our-trial-by-fire?page=2 | title = Our Trial by Fire | last = Manning | first = Richard | publisher = onearth.org | date = 1 December 2007 | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080630035505/http://www.onearth.org/article/our-trial-by-fire?page=2 | archivedate = 30 June 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological benefits of fire are often overridden by the economic and safety benefits of protecting structures and human life.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems&amp;file=events/fire/ | title = Extreme Events: Wild &amp; Forest Fire | publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114111211/http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems&amp;file=events%2Ffire%2F | archivedate = 14 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast and effective detection is a key factor in wildfire fighting.&lt;ref&gt;San-Miguel-Ayanz, ''et al.'', 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Early detection efforts were focused on early response, accurate results in both daytime and nighttime, and the ability to prioritize fire danger.&lt;ref name=Integration&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.westerndisastercenter.org/DOCUMENTS/PERS_PAPER.pdf | format = PDF | title = An Integration of Remote Sensing, GIS, and Information Distribution for Wildfire Detection and Management | journal = Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing | volume = 64 | issue = 10 | date = October 1998 | pages = 977–985 | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090816123809/http://www.westerndisastercenter.org/DOCUMENTS/PERS_PAPER.pdf | archivedate = 16 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fire lookout tower]]s were used in the United States in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones, [[carrier pigeon]]s, and [[heliograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archives.cbc.ca/version_print.asp?page=1&amp;IDLan=1&amp;IDClip=4917&amp;IDDossier=849&amp;IDCat=346&amp;IDCatPa=261 | title = Radio communication keeps rangers in touch | publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Digital Archives | date = 21 August 1957 | accessdate = 6 February 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813160525/http://archives.cbc.ca/version_print.asp?page=1&amp;IDLan=1&amp;IDClip=4917&amp;IDDossier=849&amp;IDCat=346&amp;IDCatPa=261 | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerial and land photography using [[instant camera]]s were used in the 1950s until [[infrared photography|infrared scanning]] was developed for fire detection in the 1960s. However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the [[incident commander|fire manager]]. During the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]], a data station was established in [[West Yellowstone]], permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours.&lt;ref name = Integration/&gt;

Currently, public hotlines, [[fire lookout]]s in towers, and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires. However, accurate human observation may be limited by [[asthenopia|operator fatigue]], time of day, time of year, and geographic location. Electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error. A government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in Australia did, however, conclude "...detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer". These systems may be semi- or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence, as suggested by [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data analyses. An integrated approach of multiple systems can be used to merge satellite data, aerial imagery, and personnel position via [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) into a collective whole for near-realtime use by wireless [[Incident Command System|Incident Command Centers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forestry.state.al.us/WildfireControl.aspx?bv=1&amp;s=0 | title = Wildfire Detection and Control | publisher = Alabama Forestry Commission | accessdate = 12 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081120135635/http://www.forestry.state.al.us/WildfireControl.aspx?bv=1&amp;s=0 | archivedate = 20 November 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Evaluation of three wildfire smoke detection systems", 4&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) which uses data from the [[Suomi NPP|Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership]] (NPP) satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space-based products. The high-resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions.  The active fire detection product using data from Suomi NPP's [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS) increases the resolution of fire observations to 1,230 feet (375 meters). Previous NASA satellite data products available since the early 2000s observed fires at 3,280 foot (1 kilometer) resolution. The data is one of the intelligence tools used by the USFS and Department of Interior agencies across the United States to guide resource allocation and strategic fire management decisions. The enhanced VIIRS fire product enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long duration wildfires – capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression. Active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center, which uses technologies developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Direct Readout Laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland. The model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12–18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction. The state of Colorado decided to incorporate the weather-fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season.

In 2014, an international campaign was organized in South Africa's Kruger National Park to validate fire detection products including the new VIIRS active fire data. In advance of that campaign, the Meraka Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria, South Africa, an early adopter of the VIIRS 375m fire product, put it to use during several large wildfires in Kruger.

The demand for timely, high-quality fire information has increased in recent years. Wildfires in the United States burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year. For the last 10 years, the USFS and Department of Interior have spent a combined average of about $2–4 billion annually on wildfire suppression.

[[File:RIAN archive 733844 Forest fires ravaging near Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.jpg|thumb|A Russian firefighter extinguishing a wildfire]]
Wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs. In less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds.&lt;ref&gt;Karki, 16&lt;/ref&gt; In more advanced nations, the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity. [[Silver iodide]] can be used to encourage snow fall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |title=China Makes Snow to Extinguish Forest Fire |publisher=FOXNews.com |accessdate=10 July 2009 |date=18 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813173448/http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195969,00.html |archivedate=13 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[fire retardant]]s and water can be dropped onto fires by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, [[airtanker|planes]], and [[helitack|helicopters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP//projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=21 July 2009 |title=Disaster Management Applications – Fire |first=Vincent G. |last=Ambrosia |publisher=NASA-Ames Research Center |date=2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724081427/http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/WRAP/projects/docs/ISRSE_PAPER_2003.PDF |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plucinski, ''et al.'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; Complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation, but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control. While more than 99% of the 10,000 new wildfires each year are contained, escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather. Wildfires in Canada and the US burn an average of {{convert|54500|km2|acre|sigfig=2|sp=us}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |title=Fighting fire in the forest |publisher=CBS News |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619212242/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/06/17/f-forest-fires.html |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | title = Climate of 2008 Wildfire Season Summary | publisher = National Climatic Data Center | date = 11 December 2008 | accessdate = 7 January 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151023095354/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=fire&amp;year=2008&amp;month=13 | archivedate = 23 October 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all, fighting wildfires can become deadly. A wildfire's burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks. Intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire, which can make fires particularly dangerous. For example, during the 1949 [[Mann Gulch fire]] in [[Montana]], USA, thirteen [[smokejumper]]s died when they lost their communication links, became disoriented, and were overtaken by the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | title = General Technical Report INT-GTR-299 – Mann Gulch Fire: A Race That Couldn't Be Won | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station | date = May 1993 | last = Rothermel | first = Richard C. | accessdate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813122911/http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr299/ | archivedate = 13 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Australian [[February 2009 Victorian bushfires]], at least 173 people died and over 2,029 homes and 3,500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire.&lt;ref name="homeslost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|title=Victorian Bushfires|date=13 March 2009|publisher=New South Wales Government|work=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227231203/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|archivedate=27 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs of wildfire suppression ===
In California, the U.S. Forest Service spends about $200 million per year to suppress 98% of wildfires and up to $1 billion to suppress the other 2% of fires that escape initial attack and become large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|title=Region 5 – Land &amp; Resource Management|website=www.fs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823005834/http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/?cid=stelprdb5412095|archivedate=23 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wildland firefighting safety ===
[[File:Wildfire fighter.jpg|thumb|right|Wildfire fighters cutting down a tree using a chainsaw]]
Wildland fire fighters face several life-threatening hazards including [[heat stress]], [[fatigue (safety)|fatigue]], [[smoke]] and [[dust]], as well as the risk of other injuries such as [[burn]]s, [[wound|cuts]] and [[Abrasion (medical)|scrapes]], [[animal bites]], and even [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref name=niosh-blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting Safety and Health|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|work=NIOSH Science Blog|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=6 August 2012|first=Corey|last=Campbell|author2=Liz Dalsey|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809023909/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/07/wildlandfire/|archivedate=9 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hot Tips from NIOSH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy|url=https://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030104/http://www.cdc.gov/NIOSH/docs/2013-158/pdfs/2013-158.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000&amp;ndash;2016, more than 350&amp;nbsp;wildland firefighters died on-duty.&lt;ref name="NIOSH Wildland Firefighting default page"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/firefighting/default.html |title=CDC - Fighting Wildfires - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic |date=May 31, 2018 |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |language=en-us |access-date=2018-11-27 |quote=Between 2000-2016, based on data compiled in the NIOSH Wildland Fire Fighter On-Duty Death Surveillance System from three data sources, over 350 on-duty WFF fatalities occurred.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in hot weather condition, fires present the risk of heat stress, which can entail feeling heat, fatigue, weakness, vertigo, headache, or nausea. Heat stress can progress into heat strain, which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature. This can lead to heat-related illnesses, such as heat rash, cramps, exhaustion or [[heat stroke]]. Various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress, including strenuous work, personal risk factors such as age and [[Physical fitness|fitness]], dehydration, sleep deprivation, and burdensome [[personal protective equipment]]. Rest, cool water, and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Smoke, ash, and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland fire fighters. The smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[formaldehyde]], as well as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[silica]]. To reduce smoke exposure, wildfire fighting crews should, whenever possible, rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke, avoid downwind firefighting, use equipment rather than people in holding areas, and minimize mop-up. Camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires. Protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

Firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks. Fire fighters should maintain good physical fitness. Fitness programs, medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt; Other injury hazards wildland fire fighters face include slips, trips and falls, burns, scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment, being struck by trees, vehicles, or other objects, plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy, snake and animal bites, vehicle crashes, electrocution from power lines or lightning storms, and unstable building structures.&lt;ref name = niosh-blog/&gt;

==Fire retardant==
Fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion. They are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates, as well as thickening agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Agueda |author2=E. Pastor |author3=E. Planas |year=2008|title=Different scales for studying the effectiveness of long-term forest fire retardants|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|volume=24|issue=6|pages=782–796|doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude, location and intensity of the wildfire.   In certain instances, fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Magill, B.|title=Officials: Fire slurry poses little threat|work=Coloradoan.com|url=http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20120706/NEWS01/307060035/Officials-Fire-slurry-poses-little-threat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers.  Fire retardant may also affect water quality through leaching, eutrophication, or misapplication. Fire retardant's effects on drinking water remain inconclusive.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boerner, C. |author2=Coday B. |author3=Noble, J. |author4=Roa, P. |author5=Roux V. |author6=Rucker K. |author7=Wing, A. |year=2012 |title=Impact of wildfire in Clear Creek Watershed of the city of Golden's drinking water supply |publisher=Colorado School of Mines |url=http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112021046/http://minesnewsroom.com/sites/default/files/wysiwyg-editor/Impacts%20of%20wildfire%20on%20Golden%27s%20drinking%20water-1.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilution factors, including water body size, rainfall, and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt; Wildfire debris (ash and sediment) clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and/or damage water treatment systems.&lt;ref name="minesnewsroom.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eichenseher, T.|year=2012|title=Colorado Wildfires Threaten Water Supplies|work=National Geographic Daily News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710084010/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120703/colorado-wildfires-waldo-high-park-hayman-threaten-water-supplies/|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land, water, wildlife habitats, and watershed quality, additional research is needed. However, on the positive side, fire retardant (specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components) has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient-deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation.&lt;ref name="coloradoan.com"/&gt;

Current USDA procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the United States must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet in order to safeguard effects of retardant runoff. Aerial uses of fire retardant are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species (plant and animal habitats).  After any incident of fire retardant misapplication, the U.S. Forest Service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made in order to determine mitigation, remediation, and/or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area.

Wildfire modeling is concerned with [[numerical simulation]] of wildfires in order to comprehend and predict fire behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://firegrowthmodel.ca/  | title = Prometheus  | publisher = Tymstra, C.; Bryce, R.W.; Wotton, B.M.; Armitage, O.B. 2009.

Using [[computational science]], wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior. Various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past, including simple ellipses and egg- and fan-shaped models. Early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity. However, the exact behavior of a wildfire's front is dependent on a variety of factors, including windspeed and slope steepness. Modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and [[Huygens' Principle]] to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon.&lt;ref&gt;G.D. Richards, "An Elliptical Growth Model of Forest Fire Fronts and Its Numerical Solution", Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng.. 30:1163–1179, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finney, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extreme value theory]] may also be used to predict the size of large wildfires. However, large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses, even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires.&lt;ref name="Alvarado, et al., 66-68"&gt;Alvarado, ''et al''., 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human risk and exposure==
{{wide image|2009 California Wildfires at JPL - Pasadena, California.jpg|933px|2009 California Wildfires at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|NASA/JPL]] – Pasadena, California}}

Wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does. Risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities, weather patterns, availability of wildfire fuels, and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Oregon State University|title=About Oregon wildfire risk|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218072405/http://oeapp.oregonexplorer.info/Wildfire/topics/topics.aspx?Res=16142|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations. However, human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk. It is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire-prone wildlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |title=The National Wildfire Mitigation Programs Database: State, County, and Local Efforts to Reduce Wildfire Risk |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907045339/http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr208en/psw_gtr208en_505-512_haines.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health. Global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/extreme-wildfires-may-be-fueled-by-climate-change/|title=Extreme wildfires may be fueled by climate change|publisher=Michigan State University|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=1 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803213631/http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2013/extreme-wildfires-may-be-fueled-by-climate-change/|archivedate=3 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mprIejWp00|title=White House explains the link between Climate Change and Wild Fires|date=August 5, 2014|work=YouTube|author=Rajamanickam Antonimuthu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811074119/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mprIejWp00|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airborne hazards===
The most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property. However, the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans.

Wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acrolein, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and benzene.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|author=Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment|year=2008|title=Wildfire smoke: A guide for public health officials|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516071549/http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/risk_assess/wildfirev8.pdf|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke. 80 -90% of wildfire smoke, by mass, is within the fine particle size class of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildlife Coordination Group|year=2001|title=Smoke management guide for prescribed and wildland fire|location=Boise, ID|publisher=National Interagency Fire Center|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011200515/http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/ottmar-smoke-management-guide.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite carbon dioxide's high concentration in smoke, it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity. Rather, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter, particularly 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and smaller, have been identified as the major health threats.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt; Other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects.

The degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length, severity, duration, and proximity of the fire. People are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract though inhalation of air pollutants. Indirectly, communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) developed the [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI), a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants. The public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|year=2009|title=Air quality index: A guide to air quality and health|accessdate=9 July 2012|url=http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507130507/http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqi_brochure_08-09.pdf|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-fire risks===
After a wildfire, hazards remain. Residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire-weakened trees. Humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into [[ash pit]]s.

=== At-Risk Groups ===

==== Firefighters====
Firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure. Due to firefighters' occupational duties, they are frequently exposed to [[Chemical hazard|hazardous chemicals]] at a close proximity for longer periods of time. A case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]-permissible exposure limits (PEL) and ACGIH threshold limit values (TLV). 5–10% are overexposed. The study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10-hour shift spent holding down a fireline. The firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritant (combination of particulate matter 3.5&amp;nbsp;µm and smaller, acrolein, and formaldehype) levels. Carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the TLV irritant index value reached a high of 10. In contrast, the OSHA PEL for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the TLV respiratory irritant index, the calculated threshold limit value is 1; any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Reinhardt|first2=T.E.|last3=Quiring|first3=S.J.|last4=Ottmar|first4=R.D.|year=2004|title=A screening-level assessment of the health risks of chronic smoke exposure for wildland firefighters|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|journal=Journal Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=1|issue=5|pages=296–305|doi=10.1080/15459620490442500|pmid=15238338|last1=Booze|first1=T.F.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530185250/https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/publications/fulltext/boozeetal2004.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2017|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.5076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2012, over 200 [[Occupational fatality|fatalities]] occurred among wildland firefighters. In addition to heat and chemical hazards, firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines; injuries from equipment; [[Occupational injury|slips, trips, and falls]]; injuries from vehicle rollovers; [[Heat illness|heat-related illness]]; [[insect bites and stings]]; [[Occupational stress|stress]]; and [[rhabdomyolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|title=CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Wildland Fire Fighting: Hot Tips to Stay Safe and Healthy (2013–158)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122154309/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2013-158/|archivedate=22 November 2016|df=dmy-all|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2013158|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Residents ====
Residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals, but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination. Exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility. Vulnerable persons such as children (ages 0–4), the elderly (ages 65 and older), smokers, and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems, even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov" /&gt;

==== Fetal exposure ====
Additionally, there is evidence of an increase in maternal stress, as documented by researchers M.H. O'Donnell and A.M. Behie, thus affecting birth outcomes.  In Australia, studies show that male infants born with drastically higher average birth weights were born in mostly severely fire-affected areas.  This is attributed to the fact that maternal signals directly affect fetal growth patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=GeneralSearch&amp;qid=1&amp;SID=3A7lyhAIveCBgjBAcZa&amp;page=2&amp;doc=16{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/11/15/emph.eov027.abstract?papetoc|title = Effects of wildfire disaster exposure on male birth weight in an Australian population.|last = O'Donnell|first = M H|date = November 15, 2015|journal = Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health|doi = 10.1093/emph/eov027|pmid = 26574560|access-date = January 27, 2016|last2 = Behie|first2 = A M|volume = 2015|issue = 1|issn = 2050-6201|pages = 344–354|pmc = 4697771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jia Coco|last2=Wilson|first2=Ander|last3=Mickley|first3=Loretta J.|last4=Dominici|first4=Francesca|last5=Ebisu|first5=Keita|last6=Wang|first6=Yun|last7=Sulprizio|first7=Melissa P.|last8=Peng|first8=Roger D.|last9=Yue|first9=Xu|date=January 2017|title=Wildfire-specific Fine Particulate Matter and Risk of Hospital Admissions in Urban and Rural Counties|journal=Epidemiology|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1097/ede.0000000000000556|issn=1044-3983|pmc=5130603|pmid=27648592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[water vapor]], [[particulate matter]], organic chemicals, [[Nitrogen oxide|nitrogen oxides]] and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |title=1 Wildfire Smoke A Guide for Public Health Officials |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509110731/http://www.epa.gov/ttnamti1/files/ambient/smoke/wildgd.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jin-Zhun|last2=Ge|first2=Dan-Dan|last3=Zhou|first3=Lin-Fu|last4=Hou|first4=Ling-Yun|last5=Zhou|first5=Ying|last6=Li|first6=Qi-Yuan|date=June 2018|title=Effects of particulate matter on allergic respiratory diseases|journal=Chronic Diseases and Translational Medicine|volume=4|issue=2|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cdtm.2018.04.001|issn=2095-882X|pmc=6034084|pmid=29988900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In asthma patients, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream like PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; however studies show that it works into the blood much quicker. The inflammation and epithelial damage done by UFP has also shown to be much more severe.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is of the largest concern in regards to wildfire.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This is particularly hazardous to the very young, elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions. The illnesses most commonly with exposure to fine particle from wildfire smoke are bronchitis, exacerbation of asthma or COPD, and pneumonia. Symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, rapid heart rate and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nurpra.2011.07.001 |title=Wildfire Smoke Exposure: A Guide for the Nurse Practitioner |date=2012 |last1=Forsberg |first1=Nicole T. |last2=Longo |first2=Bernadette M. |last3=Baxter |first3=Kimberly |last4=Boutté |first4=Marie |journal=[[The Journal for Nurse Practitioners]] |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=98–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with [[asthma]] related to PM from wildfires, a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is the increased use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]], such as inhalers, in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Colleen E.|last2=Brauer|first2=Michael|last3=Johnston|first3=Fay H.|last4=Jerrett|first4=Michael|last5=Balmes|first5=John R.|last6=Elliott|first6=Catherine T.|date=2016-04-15|title=Critical Review of Health Impacts of Wildfire Smoke Exposure|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|language=en|volume=124|issue=9|pages=1334–43|doi=10.1289/ehp.1409277|issn=0091-6765|pmc=5010409|pmid=27082891}}&lt;/ref&gt; In investigating the association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure, researchers found increases both in the usage of inhalers and initiation of long-term control as in oral steroids.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; More specifically, some people with [[asthma]] reported higher use of [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] (inhalers).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; After two major wildfires in California, researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for [[Asthma|quick-relief medications]] in the years following the wildfires than compared to the year before each occurrence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 

There is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and the exacerbation of asthma.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Carbon monoxide danger ===
{{Main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire. For this reason, carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters. CO in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs. At high concentrations, it can cause headache, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, disorientation, visual impairment, coma and even death. However, even at lower concentrations, such as those found at wildfires, individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia.&lt;ref name="oehha.ca.gov"/&gt;  A recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990–2006 found that 21.9% of the deaths occurred from heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Wildfire Coordinating Group|date=June 2007|title=Wildland firefighter fatalities in the United States 1990–2006|publisher=NWCG Safety and Health Working Team|url=http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315081248/http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms841/pms841_all-72dpi.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders. Both adults and children from countries ranging from the United States and Canada to Greece and Australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires. These include [[Post-traumatic stress disorder among athletes|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, and [[Phobia|phobias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21957753 |date=2011 |last1=Papanikolaou |first1=V |last2=Adamis |first2=D |last3=Mellon |first3=RC |last4=Prodromitis |first4=G |title=Psychological distress following wildfires disaster in a rural part of Greece: A case-control population-based study |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=11–26 |journal=International Journal of Emergency Mental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jts.20411 |title=Locus of control and psychopathology in relation to levels of trauma and loss: Self-reports of Peloponnesian wildfire survivors |date=2009 |last1=Mellon |first1=Robert C. |last2=Papanikolau |first2=Vasiliki |last3=Prodromitis |first3=Gerasimos |journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=189–96 |pmid=19452533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.58.4.509 |title=Psychiatric Disorders Among Adults Seeking Emergency Disaster Assistance After a Wildland-Urban Interface Fire |date=2007 |last1=Marshall |first1=G.

In a new twist to wildfire health effects, former uranium mining sites were burned over in the summer of 2012 near North Fork, Idaho. This prompted concern from area residents and Idaho State Department of Environmental Quality officials over the potential spread of radiation in the resultant smoke, since those sites had never been completely cleaned up from radioactive remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Idaho Wildfire: Radiation Raises Slight Concern As Blaze Hits Former Uranium, Gold Mines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|publisher=Huffington Post|first=Jessica|last=Leader|date=21 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021734/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/21/idaho-wildfire-2012-radiation_n_1902414.html|archivedate=26 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epidemiology ===
The western US has seen an increase in both frequency and intensity of wildfires over the last several decades. This increase has been attributed to the arid climate of the western US and the effects of global warming. An estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in the Western United States. Evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air, through the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|title=Particulate Matter (PM) Standards|date=April 24, 2016|publisher=EPA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815125540/http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas, epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke.

The EPA has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards are part of the Clean Air Act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and the monitoring of ambient air quality.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; In addition to these monitoring programs, the increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas have precipitated several epidemiological studies. Such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke. The size of the particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter (fine) is easily inhaled into the human respiratory tract. Often, small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress, illness, or disease.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

An increase in PM smoke emitted from the Hayman fire in Colorado in June 2002, was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.11.030 |title=Wildfire smoke and respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |date=2005 |last1=Sutherland |first1=E.

While the size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects, the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) from wildfire smoke should also be considered. Antecedent studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels.
