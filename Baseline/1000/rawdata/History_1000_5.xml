      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19835">The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) and [[American Express]] to call to action and challenge government authorities responsible for important cultural resources to identify sites immediately at risk, and to stimulate public awareness of the tremendous need to [[Historic preservation|preserve]] and create sustainable uses for significant [[cultural heritage|heritage made by man]].&lt;ref name=1998_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = Palpung named to list of endangered monuments | date=September 1997 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.asianart.com/cers/palpung/palpwmw.html|accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1998_official&gt;{{cite web | title = 1998 World Monuments Watch | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_Catalog_1998.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, the program publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that is in urgent need of preservation funding and protection. The sites are nominated by public authorities, local preservation groups, and qualified individuals.&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the site's overall significance, the urgency of its situation, the viability of action plans to save it, and the ability of a local constituency to sustainably maintain the site in the future with the means to do so.&lt;ref name=1998_press_release /&gt; WMF and American Express award grants to sites included on the Watch List. In addition, the leverage from the listing spurs government agencies and local donors to allocate funds and take an active role in protecting the cultural landmark.&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt;

==1998 Watch List==
The 1998 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was launched on September 8, 1997, by WMF President [[Bonnie Burnham]].&lt;ref name=1998_official /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">'''Aboiteau''' farming on reclaimed [[marshland]] is a [[labor-intensive]] method in which earthen [[Levee|dyke]]s are constructed to stop high tides from inundating marshland.  A wooden [[sluice]] or aboiteau (plural aboiteaux) is then built into the dyke, with a hinged door (clapper valve) that swings open at [[low tide]] to allow fresh water to drain from the farmland but swings shut at [[high tide]] to prevent [[Seawater|salt water]] from inundating the fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/local/article/90160 "More funding for shifting aboiteau" - Metro News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605062437/http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/local/article/90160 |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amherstdaily.com/Construction-real-estate/2007-08-14/article-384737/Excavation-uncovers-Acadian-aboiteau/1 "Excavation uncovers Acadian aboiteau" - Amherst Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboiteau farming is intimately linked with the story of [[Acadians|French Acadian]] colonization of the shores of Canada's [[Bay of Fundy]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hatvany, MG "The Origins of the Acadian Aboiteau: An Environmental Historical Geography," Historical Geography, 30 (2002): 121-137.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kamouraska, Quebec|Kamouraska region]] of the [[St. Lawrence Valley]] of Quebec, aboiteau diking of salt marshes was closely tied to the modernization of agriculture in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hatvany, MG Marshlands: Four Centuries of Environmental Change on the Shores of the St. Lawrence (Québec: Les Presses de l'Université Laval, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The Acadians constructed earthen dykes to isolate areas of salt marsh from repeated inundation by the tides.

A rare original "aboiteau" is the jewel of the West Pubnico Acadian Museums' artifacts.   In 1990, local residents found a couple of boards sticking out of an eroding beach on Double Island, West Pubnico.  They returned to the site in 1996 to remove the aboiteau, to preserve and display it at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Musée des Acadiens des Pubnicos et Centre de recherche&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] line depicted, [[Biblioteca Estense]], [[Modena]]]]

The '''Age of Discovery''', or the '''Age of Exploration''' (approximately from the beginning of the [[15th century]] until the end of the [[18th century]]) is an informal and loosely defined term for the [[historical period|period]] in [[Europe]]an  history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and was the beginning of [[globalization]]. It also marks the rise of the period of widespread adoption in Europe of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents. 
 
Global exploration started with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] of the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], the coast of Africa, and the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498; and the [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Spain]]) the trans-Atlantic [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 and the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late [[19th century]], and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the [[20th century]].

European overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the ''[[Old World]]'' (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ''[[New World]]'' (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]; a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. This represented one of the most-significant [[globalization|global]] events concerning ecology, agriculture and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. Under the direction of [[Henry the Navigator]], the Portuguese developed a new, much lighter ship, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a [[new world]], the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus – Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, "Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580", p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Siberia]], and Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
{{See also|Early world maps|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}

===Rise of European trade===
Between the 12th and 15th centuries the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes, causing Europe to become one of the world's most prosperous trading networks.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC |location= New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} 

Before the 12th century the main obstacle to trade east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] was lack of commercial incentive rather than inadequate ship design.  Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus|parts of Muslim Spain]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|316-38}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|328}}

===Technology: ship design and the compass===
[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|left|A large dhow with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].  Dhows had superior maneuverability and were used in the Indian Ocean before being built in Italy in the 13th century.]]Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the [[compass|magnetic compass]] and advances in ship design.  

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last=Merson |first= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=|postscript = &lt;A companion to the PBS Series "The Genius That Was China"&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|351-2}} The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.  The compass card was also a European invention.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

[[File:Adler von Lübeck. Model ship 05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] stern-post rudder of the [[Hanseatic league]] flagship ''[[Adler von Lübeck]]'' (1567–1581]] The Chinese also made several important improvements in ship design, such as the sternpost rudder, multiple masts and lateen sails.  These improvements gave greater maneuverability and allowed ships to sail at any time of the year.  These new style ships were produced in Italian states between 1280 and 1330, resulting in a boost in trade and connectivity between northern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"/&gt;  [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] remained popular for trade because of their low cost. [[Galley]]s were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Ships grew in size, required smaller crews and were able to sail longer distances without stopping.  This led to significant lower long distance shipping costs by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

===Geography and maps===
The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], a document dating from 40-60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the eastern coast of Africa, which states "for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)".  European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back from the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. 
Another source was the [[Radhanite|Radhanite Jewish trade networks]] of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the [[Crusader states]].

[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - world map.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century) in a 15th-century reconstruction]]
In 1154, the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] created a description of the world and a [[world map]], the [[Tabula Rogeriana]], at the court of King [[Roger II of Sicily]],&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156–61.&lt;/ref&gt; but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African [[Sahara]], but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from [[Early world maps|old]] Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] exploration of [[Mauritania]]. The [[Red Sea]] was barely known and only trade links with the [[Maritime republics]], the [[Republic of Venice]] especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] sponsored a series of long range [[Treasure voyages|tributary missions]] under the command of [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleets visited [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Thailand]]. But the journeys, reported by [[Ma Huan]], a [[Muslim]] voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not followed up, as the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade.

By 1400 a Latin translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both for mapmaking and worldview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Love 2006|Love 2006]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval travel (1241–1438) ===

[[File:Travels of Marco Polo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Marco Polo]] travels (1271–1295)]]

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing [[Eurasia]] by land in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#silk-road 2008|silk-road 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Mongols]] had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'' allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the [[Maritime republics]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The close [[Italian city-states|Italian]] links to the [[Levant]] raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Fortune|last=Crowley|first=Roger|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571245956|edition=Main|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean region who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Christian embassies were sent as far as [[Karakorum]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]], from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first of these travellers was [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], dispatched by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Great Khan]], who journeyed to [[Mongolia]] and back from 1241 to 1247.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About the same time, Russian prince [[Yaroslav of Vladimir]], and subsequently his sons [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir]], travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French [[André de Longjumeau]] and Flemish [[William of Rubruck]], who reached China through Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo]], a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the [[Yuan Dynasty]] court of [[Kublai Khan]] in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', and it was read throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers [[Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi]] sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 2006|Parry 2006]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1325 to 1354, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar from [[Tangier]], [[Ibn Battuta]], journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ''[[Rihla]]'' ("The Journey"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunn 2004|Dunn 2004]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by [[John Mandeville]] acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the [[Axis mundi|centre of the world]].

Following the period of [[Timurid relations with Europe]], in 1439 [[Niccolò de' Conti]] published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466–1472, Russian merchant [[Afanasy Nikitin]] of [[Tver]] travelled to India, which he described in his book ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The [[Mongol Empire]] collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The [[Black Death]] of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.

===Chinese missions (1405–1433)===
{{Further|Treasure voyages|Chinese exploration}}
[[File:Stellardiagram-Zhengho.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|"Mao Kun map", believed to be based on [[Zheng He]]'s travels, showing sailing directions between ports of SE Asia and as far as Malindi, in ''[[Wu Bei Zhi]]'' (1628)]]
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618–907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] sponsored a series of long range [[tribute|tributary missions]] in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A large fleet of new [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks—that the Chinese termed [[Chinese treasure ship|''bao chuan'' (treasure ships)]]—may have measured 121 metres (400&amp;nbsp;feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Malay Archipelago]] and [[Thailand]] (at the time called [[Siam]]), exchanging goods along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tamura 1997|Tamura 1997]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented gifts of gold, silver, [[porcelain]] and [[silk]]; in return, received such novelties as [[ostrich]]es, [[zebra]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ivory]] and [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cromer 1995|Cromer 1995]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tsai 2002|Tsai 2002]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as [[Madagascar]]. The travels were reported by [[Ma Huan]], a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; [[Hongxi Emperor]] ended further expeditions and [[Xuande Emperor]] suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.

==Atlantic Ocean (1419–1507)==
{{see also|Maritime history of Europe#The European Age of Discovery (1400–1600)|Portuguese discoveries}}
[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]]]]

From the 8th century until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighbouring [[maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East.   The [[Silk Road|silk]] and [[spice trade]], involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in [[medieval medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Spice importance for medieval [[humorism]] principles of medicine was such that shortly after entering the trade, apothecaries and physicians like [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Garcia de Orta|Garcia da Orta]] (see [[#Burns 2001|Burns 2001]], p. 14) were sent to India having studied spices in works like ''Suma Oriental'' (see [[#Pires 1512|Pires 1512]], p. lxii) and ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India)&lt;/ref&gt; religious [[ritual]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]ry, as well as [[food additive]]s and [[Food preservatives|preservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ScienceDaily 1998|ScienceDaily 1998]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders—mainly descendants of Arab sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]—dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly [[Kozhikode]], westward to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]]. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], that eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1453-09&gt;{{cite web|title=

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] had turned to North African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant [[Commercial Revolution#Monetary factors|deficit in silver and gold]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], pp. 339–49.&lt;/ref&gt; as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of [[bullion]] leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ''[[Bank of Saint George|Banco di San Giorgio]]'', was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land [[cabotage]], guided by [[portolan chart]]s. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a [[compass]] heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the [[compass]], as well as progressive new advances in [[cartography]] and [[astronomy]]. Arab navigational tools like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] were used for [[celestial navigation]].

===Portuguese exploration===

In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the [[reconquista]] completed, King [[Dinis of Portugal]] took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[admiral]] of the [[Portuguese navy]], with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325 and 1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1960|Diffie 1960]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Islands]], already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butel 1999|Butel 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|last=Chaudhuri|first=K. N.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was [[Battle of Ceuta|conquered]] by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes. For centuries [[Arab slave trade|slave and gold]] trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; like the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and to probe whether it was possible to reach the [[Indies]] by sea, the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of [[Mauritania]], gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1419) and the [[Azores]] (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was [[João Gonçalves Zarco]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age Of Prince Henry The Navigator. (New York: Dutton), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Non]] (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Locke 1824|Locke 1824]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult [[Cape Bojador]] that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], finally passed.

A major advance was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail [[Windward and leeward|windward]] more than any other in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal [[cabotage]] navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For [[celestial navigation]] the Portuguese used the [[Ephemerides]], which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician [[Abraham Zacuto]], the [[Almanach Perpetuum]] included some of these tables for the movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto – (1450–1515), http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111917/jewish/Rabbi-Abraham-Zacuto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of [[latitude]]. Exact [[longitude]], however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russell-Wood 1998|Russell-Wood 1998]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445 and in 1446, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]].

In 1453 the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the hands of the [[Ottomans]] was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' reinforcing the previous ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daus 1983|Daus 1983]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagrow 1964|Bagrow 1964]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1456 [[Diogo Gomes]] reached the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry – including the Genoese [[Antonio da Noli]] and Venetian [[Alvise Cadamosto]] – discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460 [[Pedro de Sintra]] reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fernão Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With his sponsorship, explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gonçalves, [[Fernão do Pó]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|João II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|São Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo Cão]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).

The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[Pêro da Covilhã]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" (Cabo da Boa Esperança), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].

Based on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram à América 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish exploration: Columbus and the West Indies===
{{see also|Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The four voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] 1492–1503]]

Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].

Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the "[[Caribbean|West Indies]]". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagaríx|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Niña]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native 'Indians' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forbes 1993|Forbes 1993]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
On the return, a storm forced him to dock in [[Lisbon]], on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===
{{Main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}
[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesilhas Treaty]] meridian (purple) and the later [[Maluku Islands]] [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]]]]

Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land—preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===A New World: Americas===
[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseemüller map]] showing the name "America" for the first time.]]
Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter&lt;ref&gt;[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].
In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

====The "True Indies" and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.
One of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499–1500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,&lt;ref name=Pohl1966&gt;{{cite book

In the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]]. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ''Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce'' (''Saint Mary's River of the Freshwater Sea'').&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{cite book

The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "[[volta do mar]]" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494—so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBTqPX4G9Y4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Cabral+four+continents&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zPIIU8HvE-af7AakkYDICw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabral%20four%20continents&amp;f=false ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580''], Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D.

At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 456–62.&lt;/ref&gt;—a Florentine who had been working for a branch of the [[Medici Bank]] in [[Seville]] since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to [[The Guianas]] with [[Juan de la Cosa]] in the service of Spain&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2|Catholic Encyclopædia 2]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—participated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "[[New World]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arciniegas 1978|Arciniegas 1978]], pp. 295–300.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mundus novus'', Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], which had become widely popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. [[America (name)|The Americas were named]] in 1507 by [[Cartography|cartographer]]s [[Waldseemüller map|Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], probably after Amerigo Vespucci.

In 1501–1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] (and/or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern [[Patagonia]] (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/839287/language/en-US/Default.aspx The Invention of America].

In 1503, [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]], challenging the Portuguese policy of ''[[mare clausum]]'', led one of the earliest [[French people|French]] [[Normandy|Normand]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.

In 1511–1512, Portuguese captains [[João de Lisboa]] and Estevão de Fróis reached the [[Rio de La Plata|River Plate]] estuary in present-day [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]], and went as far south as the present-day [[Gulf of San Matias]] at 42°S (recorded in the ''Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt'' meaning "New Tidings from the Land of Brazil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After they had navigated for nearly {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=on}} to round the cape, they again sighted the continent on the other side, and steered towards the northwest, but a storm prevented them from making any headway.

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the [[Strait of Magellan]].

In 1524–1525, [[Aleixo Garcia]], a Portuguese conquistador (possibly a veteran of the Solís expedition of 1516), led a private expedition of a few shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, that recruited about 2000 [[Guaraní people|Guaraní Indians]]. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], using the native trail network, the ''Peabiru''. They were also the first Europeans to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the [[Andes]], near [[Sucre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/sv/svh009b.htm ''Peabiru, the route lost''] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian Ocean (1497–1513)==

===Gama's route to India===

{{see also|Portuguese India Armadas}}

[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497–1499 travel to India (black). Previous travels of [[Pêro da Covilhã]] (orange) and [[Afonso de Paiva]] (blue), and their common route (green)]]

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King [[John II of Portugal]]'s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was undervalued,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morison 1942|Morison 1942]], pp. 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because [[Bartolomeu Dias]] departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa, therefore they believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias's return from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, and [[Pêro da Covilhã]]'s travel to [[Ethiopia]] overland indicated that the richness of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Sea]] was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

Under new king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], on July 1497 a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left [[Lisbon]] under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]]. By December the fleet passed the [[Great Fish River]]—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World|last=Bernstein|first=William J.|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802144164|date=2008|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] they made a first landfall on the Brazilian coast; later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral's ships reached [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] in 1507; [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506. In the same year [[Lourenço de Almeida]] landed in [[Sri Lanka]], the eastern island named "[[Names of Sri Lanka|Taprobane]]" in remote accounts of [[Alexander the Great]]'s and 4th-century BC Greek [[geographer]] [[Megasthenes]]. On the Asiatic mainland the first [[factory (trading post)|factories (trading-posts)]] were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510).

===The "Spice Islands" and China===
[[File:Malaccaship.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Replica of ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] housing the Maritime Museum of [[Malacca]]]]

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the centre of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: [[Duarte Fernandes]] as the first European envoy to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (modern [[Thailand]]).

Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "spice islands"—the [[Maluku Islands]], mainly the [[Banda Islands|Banda]], then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, was the main purpose for the travels in the Indian sea—he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to Banda (via [[Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milton 1999|Milton 1999]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Armando|last=Cortesão|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false|title=The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515|publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1944|accessdate=2016-02-10|isbn=9788120605350}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain [[Francisco Serrão]], after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of São João Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In May 1513 [[Jorge Álvares]], one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]], it was [[Rafael Perestrello]]—a cousin of the famed [[Christopher Columbus]]—who became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in [[Guangzhou]] in 1516, commanding a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfoundes 1882|Pfoundes 1882]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nowell 1947|Nowell 1947]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and in 1522 at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]], during which the Chinese captured Portuguese [[breech-loading swivel gun]]s and reverse engineered the technology, calling them "Folangji" 佛郎機 ([[Farangi|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "Folangji" by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy [[Macau]].

To enforce a trade monopoly, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], were seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1513 while trying to conquer [[Aden]], an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the [[Red Sea]] inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], and sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island. In 1521, a force under [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]], ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole 2002|Cole 2002]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Red Sea, [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]].

==Pacific Ocean (1513–1529)==
[[File:Balboa Voyage 1513.PNG|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s travel to the "[[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]", 1513]]

===Discovery of the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Acandí]], in present-day [[Colombia]], Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] heard unexpected news of an "other sea" rich in gold, which he received with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otfinoski 2004|Otfinoski 2004]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With few resources and using information given by ''[[cacique]]s'', he journeyed across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Using a small [[brigantine]] and ten native [[canoe]]s, they sailed along the coast and made landfalls. On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this "other sea" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipiélago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.

===Subsequent developments to the east===
In 1515–1516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[Río de la Plata]], which Solís named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the "South Sea".

At the same time, the Portuguese in Southeast Asia made the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first European report on the western Pacific]], having identified [[Luzon]] east of [[Borneo]] and named its inhabitants the "[[Luções]]", in the modern [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

===First circumnavigation===
[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519–1522)]]

By 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. Among them were explorers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[João Serrão]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], cartographers [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Rui Faleiro|Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ferdinand Magellan—who had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serrão]] living there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;—developed the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships—the [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or "naus"—with a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]]. (Detail from ''[[Maris Pacifici]]'' by [[Ortelius]], 1589.)]]

The fleet sailed further and further south, avoiding the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and became the first to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the tip of the Americas. On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&amp;nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named ''Mar Pacífico'' because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2007|Catholic Encyclopædia 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]]. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Strait of Magellan]] was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that [[Manila galleon|opened up trade]] between [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (present-day [[Mexico]]) and [[Manila]] in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===

[[File:Saavedra-1527-1529.svg|thumb|Saavedra's failed attempts to find a return route from the Maluku to New Spain (Mexico) in 1529]]
Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1525, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] sent another expedition westward to colonize the [[Maluku Islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] and included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and Loaísa, who lost their lives then, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]].

Near the [[Strait of Magellan]] one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56° S, where they thought seeing "''earth's end''": so [[Cape Horn]] was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at [[Tidore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]], one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian [[Kenneth McIntyre]], stating it was discovered by [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527 [[Hernán Cortés]] fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the "South Sea" (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] to take charge. On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519–1532)==
Rumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "[[conquistadors]]", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

In 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de León]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt; With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''—because it was [[Easter]] (Florida) season—believing it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ponce de León Inlet]] and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards: this was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weddle 1985|Weddle 1985]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They explored down the coast reaching [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Dry Tortugas]] and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle [[Cuba]] to return, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July.

===Cortés' Mexico and the Aztec Empire===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}

[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|Route of Cortés inland progress 1519–1521]]
In 1517 [[Cuba]]'s governor [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] commissioned a fleet under the command of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Hernández de Córdoba]] to explore the [[Yucatán peninsula]]. They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hernán Cortés]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.

In February 1519 Cortés went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucatán, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"&gt;[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cortés learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].

In July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; There Cortés asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitlán]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cortés' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]
Arriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cortés enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Restall 2004|Restall 2004]], pp. 659–87.&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], to oppose Cortès, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés's lieutenants committed a [[massacre in the Great Temple]], triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castillo 1963|Castillo 1963]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'', where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]] they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from [[Cuba]], Cortés [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|besieged Tenochtitlán]] and captured its ruler [[Cuauhtémoc]] in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro's Peru and the Inca Empire===
[[File:Conquest peru 1531 edited.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Francisco Pizarro]]'s route of exploration during the conquest of [[Peru]] (1531–1533)]]

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pirú. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about "Pirú" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hernán Cortés]], caught the attention of Pizarro.

[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "''Empresa del Levante''": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.

Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.

They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulación de Toledo''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hernándo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].

Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Huáscar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: "''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&amp;nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==New trade routes (1542–1565)==
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]

In 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]], 1570–1616 Japan]]

He reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595 – 17th century)==
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]

Nations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

In 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.

Philip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten"'' (''"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book&lt;/ref&gt; This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploring North America===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609–1611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]

The 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520–1521 the Portuguese [[João Álvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban Gómez|Estevão Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name "California". [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|João Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].

The English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 somewhere north of Cabrillo's landing site—the actual location of Drake's landing was secret and is still undetermined
&lt;ref&gt;Sir Francis Drake Association | http://www.SirFrancisDrakeAssociation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Drake N.Guild|Drake N.Guild]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—and claimed the land for England,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright's World Chart 1599 documents a Land Claim | http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0082288414Z.00000000027&lt;/ref&gt; calling it [[New Albion|Nova Albion]]. The term "Nova Albion" was therefore used on many European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#USF 2010|USF 2010]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] to India, Kingdom of England's [[Henry Hudson]], under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].

===Search for a northern route===
[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]

France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were separated by "terrible whirlwinds" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].

====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====
5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.

In 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===

''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, "the unknown land of the south") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136–246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luís Vaz de Torres|Luis Váez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].
[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]
[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning "Little Dove"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in "the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands." On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.

In 1642–1644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581–1660)==
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]
In the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.

===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While [[Cossacks]] came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].

Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]
In 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.

In 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

In 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].

In 1649–50 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650–53. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).

In 1659–65 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733–1743.

European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref name="Mayne 2009"&gt;[[#Mayne 2009|Mayne 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.

The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.

Similarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland. (See [[Atlantic slave trade]]).

Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50–90% of their population. (See [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cook 1998|Cook 1998]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maize]] and [[Cassava|manioc]] were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSU 2006|OSU 2006]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]".

Crosby]] speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th-century economy of China, the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.

[[File:Jesuites en chine.jpg|thumb|[[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit]] scholars collaborated extensively with Chinese astronomers, introducing [[Copernican principle]]s.

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Columbia University 2009|Columbia University 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This included [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops—wheat, millet, and rice—could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"&gt;[[#Ebrey 2006|Ebrey 2006]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], pp. 198–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the Song Dynasty (960–1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gernet 1962|Gernet 1962]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the [[Nanban trade|Nanban trade period]], with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562–1633) on mathematical work.

As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], "[[Dutch Golden Age]]" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551–1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.

Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

From China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly–used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]—where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

[[File:Heem, Jan Davidsz. de - A Richly Laid Table with Parrots - detail cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], detail of silverware from "A Richly Laid Table with Parrots", c. 1650]]

[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559–1636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"/&gt;

The increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potosí]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveller in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523–25&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.

One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Appel de Blois''' is an initiative{{When|date=September 2010}} by [[Liberté pour l’Histoire]] to work against [[legislative authorities]] criminalizing the past through the legislative,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lph-asso.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=19&amp;lang=en French memory laws] www.lph-asso.fr&lt;/ref&gt; thus putting more and more obstacles in the way of historical research.

The initiative asks people to sign up under this:
{{Quote|Concerned about the retrospective moralization of history and intellectual censure, we call for the mobilization of European historians and for the wisdom of politicians.
History must not be a slave to contemporary politics nor can it be written on the command of competing memories. In a free state, no political authority has the right to define historical truth and to restrain the freedom of the historian with the threat of penal sanctions.
We call on historians to marshal their forces within each of their countries and to create structures similar to our own, and, for the time being, to individually sign the present appeal, to put a stop to this movement toward laws aimed at controlling history memory.
We ask government authorities to recognize that, while they are responsible for the maintenance of the collective memory, they must not establish, by law and for the past, an official truth whose legal application can carry serious consequences for the profession of history and for intellectual liberty in general.
In a democracy, liberty for history is liberty for all.|https://web.archive.org/web/20081111031740/http://www.lph-asso.fr/actualites/42.html}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">The '''Argippaeans''' or '''Argippaei''' are a people mentioned by [[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]].'' He mentions them as north of the Scythians and much of the scholarship points to them being a tribe near the [[Ural Mountains]].

==In Herodotus==

{{quotation|
As far as their country, the tract of land whereof I have been speaking is all a smooth plain, and the soil deep; beyond you enter on a region which is rugged and stony. Passing over a great extent of this rough country, you come to a people dwelling at the foot of lofty mountains, who are said to be all—both men and women—bald from their birth, to have flat noses, and very long chins. These people speak a language of their own,. the dress which they wear is the same as the Scythian. They live on the fruit of a certain tree, the name of which is Ponticum; in size it is about equal to our fig-tree, and it bears a fruit like a bean, with a stone inside. When the fruit is ripe, they strain it through cloths; the juice which runs off is black and thick, and is called by the natives “aschy.” They lap this up with their tongues, and also mix it with milk for a drink; while they make the lees, which are solid, into cakes, and eat them instead of meat; for they have but few sheep in their country, in which there is no good pasturage. Each of them dwells under a tree, and they cover the tree in winter with a cloth of thick white felt, but take off the covering in the summer-time. No one harms these people, for they are looked upon as sacred—they do not even possess any warlike weapons. When their neighbours fall out, they make up the quarrel; and when one flies to them for refuge, he is safe from all hurt. They are called the Argippaeans.” |Herodotus | The Histories | Translated by George Rawlinson &lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/herodotus/h4/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7405">The '''Borussian myth''' or '''Borussian legend'''&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Michael (1992). ''Early Modern Germany, 1477-1806'', MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. xi. {{ISBN|0-8122-1427-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given by 20th-century historians of German history to the earlier idea that [[German unification]] was inevitable, and that it was [[Prussia]]'s destiny to accomplish it.  The Borussian myth is an example of a [[teleological]] argument.  ''Borussia'' is the Latin name for Prussia.

==Teleological arguments==
A teleological argument holds all things to be designed for, or directed toward, a specific final result.  That specific result gives events and actions, even retrospectively, an inherent purpose.  When applied to the historical process, an historical teleological argument posits the result as the inevitable trajectory of a specific set of events.  These events lead "inevitably," as [[Karl Marx]] or [[Friedrich Engels]] proposed, to a specific set of conditions or situations; the resolution of those lead to another, and so on.  This goal-oriented, 'teleological' notion of the historical process as a whole is present in a variety of arguments about the past: the "inevitability," for example, of the revolution of the proletariat and the [[Whig history|"Whiggish"]] narrative of past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment that culminated in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Butterfield]], ''The Whiggish Interpretation of History,'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinning the myth==

The narrative of the heroic past fell to such nationalist German historians as  [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] (1834–1896), [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), and [[Heinrich von Sybel]] (1817–1895), to name three. Treitschke in particular viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, ''The peculiarities of German history: bourgeois society and politics in nineteenth-century Germany.'' Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-19-873057-6}} p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; These historical arguments can also be called the grand, or great, narratives but they are inherently [[ethnocentric]], at least when applied to the historical process.&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  Treitschke's'' History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century'', published in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges the history of Prussia over the history of other German states, and it tells the story of the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this myth (''Borussia'' is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Friedrich, ''The other Prussia: royal Prussia, Poland and liberty, 1569–1772'', New York, 2000, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. This interpretation emphasizes Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of [[Napoleon]]'s power in 1814, at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], creating some semblance of economic unity through the ''[[Zollverein]]'' (German customs union), and uniting Germans under one proud flag after the defeat of France in the [[Franco Prussian War]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Many modern historians describe this myth, without subscribing to it: for example, Rudy Koshar, ''Germany's Transient Pasts: Preservation and the National Memory in the Twentieth Century.'' Chapel Hill, 1998; Hans Kohn. ''German history; some new German views.'' Boston, 1954; Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany history from Napoleon to Bismarck.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deconstructing the myth==

After [[World War II]], various historians of Germany sought to re-examine the German past, in part to understand the immediate German past and the [[Holocaust]], and in part to understand Germany's supposed [[democratic deficit]]: Theoretically, Germans were inexperienced with democracy and self-government because their experience in unification came under the leadership of the least democratic of the German states (Prussia). This inevitably led to, first, [[World War I]], and second the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]], third, to the rise of [[National Socialism]], and fourth, to [[World War II]].

The Borussian myth was linked to the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' theory of Germany's ''peculiar road'' to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley, ''Peculiarities of German History,'' p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  The set of circumstances that predated the Unification, for example, the so-called failure of the [[1848 revolution|1848 German revolutions]] and the elimination of [[German dualism|Austria]] as a possible leader in the unification process strengthen the myth's appeal.  In this way, teleological arguments tend to work backward from an event, to describe and rationalize all trends leading to it;&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  they are [[genealogy|genealogical]]&amp;mdash;trace from the present to the past&amp;mdash;rather than historical, which explores the past to the present.

In the 1970s, and later, as [[social history|social]] and [[cultural history|cultural]] historians examined nineteenth-century German history in greater depth, they realized that not only was there a vibrant and lively German culture without Prussia, but they also deconstructed significant elements of the ''Sonderweg'' theory as well.  They discovered, for example, that the 1848 Revolutions in Germany actually had some significant successes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Sperber, Rhineland radicals: the democratic movement and the revolution of 1848–1849. Princeton, N.J., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the history of 19th-century Germany was not a long process of grinding under the heel of Prussian militarism, but instead a process of economic expansion, testing of democratic institutions, the writing and testing of constitutions, and the creation of social insurance systems to maintain long term economic security.&lt;ref&gt;David Blackbourn, ''The long nineteenth century: a history of Germany, 1780–1918.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507672-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1227">In a historical context, a '''covenant''' applies to formal promises that were made under [[oath]], or in less remote history, agreements in which the name actually uses the term 'covenant', implying that they were binding for all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} One of the earliest attested covenants between parties is the so-called Mitanni treaty, dating to the 14th or 15th century BC, between the [[Hittites]] and the [[Mitanni]].

Historically, certain treaties and compacts have been given the name "covenant", most notably the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] that marked the [[Covenanter]]s, a [[Protestant]] political organization important in the [[history of Scotland]]. The term 'covenant' appears throughout Scottish, English and Irish history.

The term covenant could be used in English to refer to either the [[Bundesbrief]] of 1291, or the [[Pfaffenbrief]] of 1370, documents which led to the formation of the Swiss state or "[[Eidgenossenschaft]]". In this usage the German "''Eid''" is being translated as "covenant" rather than "oath" in order to reflect its written status.

The '''date of birth of [[Jesus]] ''' is not stated in the [[gospels]] or in any secular text but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett. (2000). [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html "Calendars"] (Ch. 12), in P. Kenneth Seidelmann (Ed.) ''Explanatory supplement to the astronomical almanac.'' Sausalito, CA: University Science Books. {{ISBN|0-935702-68-7}}. p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches—one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[Gospel of Luke|Gospels of Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M. Yamauchi 1989 {{ISBN|0-931464-50-1}} pp. 113–129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimation via the Nativity accounts==
The [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[New Testament]] gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus, and [[Karl Rahner]] states that the gospels do not, in general, provide enough details of dates to satisfy the demands of modern historians.&lt;ref name=Rahner732 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} p. 731&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholars do not see the Luke and Matthew nativity stories as historically factual,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Borg]], "The Meaning of the Birth Stories" in Marcus Borg, N T Wright, ''The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions'' (Harper One, 1999) page 179: "I (and most mainline scholars) do not see these stories as historically factual."&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason, they do not consider them a reliable method for determining Jesus' date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus''. Penguin, 1993, pages 85–88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states that the authors of the gospels generally focused on theological elements rather than historical chronologies.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Luke and Matthew associate Jesus' birth with the time of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name="Rahner731"/&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] states that "Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king". He also implies that Jesus could have been as much as two years old at the time of the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], because Herod ordered the murder of all boys up to the age of two years, "in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi".

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of Jesus,&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 /&gt; but places the birth during the [[Census of Quirinius]], which only took place ten years later in AD 6 as described by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 /&gt; He, in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (c. AD 93), indicates that Cyrenius/Quirinius' governorship of Syria began in AD 6, and Josephus mentions a census sometime between AD 6–7.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E5dCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=josephus+antiquities+of+the+jews&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 18, Chapters 1–2]. Josephus indicates that the census under Cyrenius (i.e., Quirinius) occurred in the 37th year after Octavian's (i.e., Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus') victory over Marc Antony at Actium, which secular historical records date to 2 September 31 BC. Therefore 31 BC + 37 years = AD 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars believe Luke made an error in referring to the census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Archer | first=Gleason Leonard | authorlink=Gleason Leonard Archer | title=Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties |date=April 1982  | publisher=Zondervan Pub.

As far as the month of Jesus' birth, it can be inferred to be summer or fall. Combining inferences from when shepherds would likely be in the fields and working backward from Zechariah's priestly service (John the Baptist's father) and its connections to Jesus' birth, one arrives at a likely date of mid-September to early October. This would suggest the conception of Jesus might have been in December, but not his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/when-was-jesus-born|title=When was Jesus born? {{!}} Bibleinfo.com|website=www.bibleinfo.com|language=en|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://christinprophecy.org/articles/when-was-jesus-born/|title=When Was Jesus Born?|work=Lamb and Lion Ministries|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working backwards from when Jesus began preaching==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Pharisees Question Jesus (Les pharisiens questionnent Jésus) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|Dispute of Jesus and the Pharisees, by [[James Tissot]], c. 1890]]
Another approach to estimating the year of birth works backwards from when Jesus began preaching, based on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that he was "about 30 years of age" at that time.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]], L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus began to preach after being baptised by [[John the Baptist]], and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]]), which scholars estimate would be in about AD 28–29.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pages 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoehner 1978 29–37"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ | last = Hoehner| first = Harold W | authorlink = Harold Hoehner|year= 1978|publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0-310-26211-9|pages= 29–37| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6z-NcR7fVSIC&amp;dq=CHronological+Aspects+of+the+Life+of+Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By working backwards from this, it would appear that Jesus was probably born no later than 1 BC. However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 27–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christmas celebration==
Despite the celebration of Christmas in December, neither Luke nor Matthew mentions a season for when Jesus was born. However, scholarly arguments regarding the realism of shepherds grazing their flock during the winter have taken place, both challenging a winter birth for Jesus as well as defending it by relying on the mildness of winters in ancient Israel and [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] rules regarding sheep near Bethlehem before February.&lt;ref&gt;"New Testament History" by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: an introduction and commentary'' by Leon Morris 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-0419-5}} p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of Jesus' Birth'' by Edwin D. Freed 2004 {{ISBN|0-567-08046-3}} pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Murray of ''History Today'' says that the celebration of [[Christmas]] as the birth day of Jesus is based on a date of a pagan feast rather than historical analysis.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas "Medieval Christmas"], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saturnalia]], the Roman feast for Saturn, was associated with the [[winter solstice]]. Saturnalia was held on 17 December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through to 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms. It is likely that such a Christian feast was chosen for Christ's marked contrast and triumph over paganism; indeed, new converts who attempted to introduce pagan elements into the Christian celebrations were sharply rebuked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7399|title=Library : History &amp; Origin: Feast of the Nativity|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 25 may have been selected due to its proximity to the winter solstice, because of its theological significance. After the solstice, the days begin to lengthen with more sunlight, which Christians see as representing the [[Light of Christ]] entering the world. This mirrors the celebration of the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on June 24, near the [[summer solstice]]; John said of Jesus "He must increase, I must decrease." {{bibleref2|John 3:30|NRSV}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-do-we-celebrate-jesus-birth-on-december-25|title=Why do we celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25? - Catholic Answers|website=www.catholic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday) was the earliest Christian celebration and included a number of theological themes. In the 2nd century, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] became a separate feast as [[Easter]] and in the same century [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] began to be celebrated in the Churches of the East on 6 January.&lt;ref&gt;''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-5856-3}} page 237&lt;/ref&gt; The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the [[Western Church]] notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present'' by Lukas Vischer 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-0520-5}} pages 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest source stating 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is likely by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox]] which he placed on 25 March, and then added nine months – festivals on that date were then celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer Dictionary'' of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 142&lt;/ref&gt; 25 March would also roughly be the date of his crucifixion, which ancient Christians would have seen as confirming the date of his birth, since there was a notion that the great prophets were conceived into the afterlife on the same date they were conceived into the world.  [[John Chrysostom]] also argued for a 25 December date in the late 4th century, basing his argument on the assumption that the offering of incense in Luke 1:8–11 was the offering of incense by a high priest on [[Yom Kippur]] (early October), and, as above, counting fifteen months forward. However, this was very likely a retrospective justification of a choice already made rather than a genuine attempt to derive the correct birth date.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Beckwith (2001). Calendar and chronology, Jewish and Christian: biblical, intertestamental and patristic studies, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, 25 December might be a reference to the date of the Feast of the Dedication, which occurs on the 25 Kislev of the Jewish calendar.  This would require that early Christians simply translated Kislev directly to December.

==In Islam==
In Islam, the Quran references a fruit branch which Mary shook as she gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=3YhpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Quran+Jesus+19&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ4_H4_4_YAhWMNY8KHd1OAG8Q6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20Jesus%2019&amp;f=false|title=Women in the Qur'an, Traditions, and Interpretation|last=Stowasser|first=Barbara Freyer|date=22 August 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199761838|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fruit, the date, is known to ripen during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dateland.com/how-are-dates-grown/|title=How are Dates Grown?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3019">The '''Declaration of Saint-Ouen''' is a statement made by the future [[Louis XVIII]] on May 2, 1814, which paved the way for [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Unlike the Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], who repudiated a [[constitution]] in favor of a absolutism upon his restoration in 1814, Louis limited himself to the revision of the [[Senate|Senatorial]] constitution while maintaining a claim to the recognition of unlimited monarchical [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence and Legitimacy: European Monarchy in the Age of Revolutions|last=Sellin|first=Volker|publisher=De Gruyter Oldenbourg|year=2017|isbn=9783110558395|location=Munich|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration also promised basic freedoms for the people as well as national representation and [[equality]] before the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alexander of Russia: Napoleon's Conqueror|last=Troyat|first=Henri|publisher=Grove Press|year=2002|isbn=0802139493|location=New York|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declaration ==
Upon landing in France, the future king rejected the provisional constitution proposed by the Senate as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]], stating that "the principles thereof were good" but since a great number of articles displayed the haste with which they were worded, "it could not in their present form become fundamental laws of the State."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Monarchies from 1814 to 1906: A Century of Restorations|last=Sellin|first=Volker|publisher=De Gruyter Oldenbourg|year=2017|isbn=9783110521771|location=Munich|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he promised to adopt a new "liberal constitution" to be drafted by a commission drawn by the Parliament. 

Louis declared that the constitution would maintain representative government with a bicameral legislature, protect freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, and freedom of worship, and guarantee personal and public liberty. The declaration stated, notably, that the lands of the aristocrats who fled, which the Republic had sold at auction, were not to be confiscated, and that no restitution was to be given. Further, that the [[Napoleonic Code]] of Law was to remain in force, that the awards and social function of the [[Legion of Honor]] given to those loyal to Napoleon was not to be abolished. Napoleon's changes to the educational system, most notably the University of Paris, would remain. It was the desire to restore all these issues to their pre-revolutionary conditions that most dramatically defined a reactionary. Many of the Ultras held these notions, thus becoming far more reactionary than the King's own policies.

The promised constitution was eventually adopted in the [[Charter of 1814]].

This timeline shows the whole [[history of the universe]], the [[Earth]], and [[Human|mankind]] in one table. Each row is defined in ''years ago'', that is, [[year]]s before the present [[calendar date|date]], with the earliest times at the top of the chart. In each table cell on the right, references to events or notable people are given, more or less in chronological order within the cell.

Each row corresponds to a change in log(time before present) of about 0.1 (using log base 10). The dividing points are taken from the R′′20 [[Renard numbers]].

The table is divided into sections with subtitles. Note that each such section contains about 68% of all the time from the beginning of the section until now.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7071">'''Dynastic cycle''' ({{zh|t=朝代循環|s=朝代循环|p=Cháodài Xúnhuán|first=t}}) is an important political theory in [[History of China|Chinese history]]. According to this theory, each [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] rises to a political, cultural, and economic peak and then, because of moral corruption, declines, loses the [[Mandate of Heaven]], and falls, only to be replaced by a new dynasty. The cycle then repeats under a surface pattern of repetitive motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin O. Reischauer, “The Dynastic Cycle,” in John Meskill, ''The Pattern of Chinese History'', (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1965), pp. 31-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

It sees a continuity in Chinese history from early times to the present by looking at the succession of empires or dynasties, implying that there is little basic development or change in social or economic structures.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=VA5tKw11K8YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dillon+dictionary+chinese+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sIlKVM3WGLLesATzu4HwDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dynastic%20cycle&amp;f=false Dynastic cycle]," in {{cite book |last = Dillon, Michael  |year = 1998 |title = China: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary |publisher = Curzon| location = Richmond, Surrey |isbn = 978-0700704392 |ref = none}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; [[John K. Fairbank]] expressed the doubts of many historians when he wrote that "the concept of the dynastic cycle... has been a major block to the understanding of the fundamental dynamics of Chinese history."&lt;ref&gt;John K. Fairbank and Edwin O. Reischauer, ''East Asia: The GreatTradition''(Boston, 1960), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cycle==
The  cycle appears as follows:{{sfnb|Fairbank|1979| p= 102}}

#A new ruler unites China, founds a new dynasty, and gains the [[Mandate of Heaven]].&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"&gt;Ching, Frank. Ancestors: 900 Years in the Life of a Chinese Family. New York: William Morrow and Company, 1974. p 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
#China, under the new dynasty, achieves prosperity.
#The population increases.
# Corruption becomes rampant in the imperial court, and the empire begins to enter decline and instability.
#A natural disaster wipes out farm land. The disaster normally would not have been a problem; however, together with the Corruption  and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], it causes famine.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
#The famine causes the population to rebel and a civil war ensues.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
#The ruler loses the Mandate of Heaven.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
#The population decreases because of the violence.&lt;ref name="Wills, John E p. 35"&gt;Wills, John E. Mountain of Fame: Portraits in Chinese History. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994- p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
#China goes through a warring states period.&lt;ref name="Wills, John E p. 35"/&gt;
#One state emerges victorious.
#The state starts a new empire.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
#The empire gains the Mandate of Heaven.&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;
:::(The cycle repeats itself.)

The Mandate of Heaven was the idea that the Emperor was favored by Heaven to rule over China. The Mandate of Heaven explanation was championed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mencius]] during the [[Warring States period]].&lt;ref name="Frank Ching"/&gt;

It has 3 main phases:
#The first is the beginning of the dynasty.
#The second is at the middle of the dynasty's life and is the peak of the dynasty.
#The last period is the decline of the dynasty, both politically and economically, until it finally collapses.

==Significance==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

Chinese history is traditionally represented in terms of dynastic cycles. Through its long history, the Chinese have been ruled not by one dynasty, but by a succession of different dynasties. The first dynasty in China to be described in ancient historical records such as [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and [[Bamboo Annals]] is the [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]], which was succeeded by the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], although concrete existence of the Xia is yet to be archaeologically proven.

Among these dynasties the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] are often considered as particularly strong periods, although other dynasties are famous for cultural and other achievements (for instance, the [[Song dynasty]] is sometimes associated with rapid economic development). Han and Tang, as well as other long, stable dynasties were followed by periods of disorder and the break-up of China into small regimes.

Out of disorder a leader eventually arose who unified the country and imposed strong central authority. For example, after the Han various dynasties ruled parts of China until [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Yang Jian]] reunited the country and established the [[Sui dynasty]]. The Sui set the scene for the long and prosperous Tang. After the fall of Tang, China again saw a period of political upheaval.

There is a famous Chinese proverb expressed in the 16th century novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] that says "After a long split, a union will occur; after a long union, a split will occur" (分久必合，合久必分). Each of these rulers would claim the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize their rule.

Although this well-known dynastic periodization of China is more or less based on traditional Sinocentric ideology, it also applies to non-native rulers who sought to gain the Mandate of Heaven. While most ruling dynasties in Chinese history were founded by native Chinese, there were also non-native or [[Conquest Dynasties]] established by non-Han Chinese people beyond the traditional border of central part of China dominated by Han Chinese people (also known as [[China proper]]). These include the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] founded by [[Mongol]]s and the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] founded by [[Manchu]]s, who later conquered the central part of China and assumed the title of [[Emperor of China]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7452">'''Ethnic history''' is a branch of [[social history]] that studies ethnic groups and immigrants. Barman (2007) argues that the field allows historians to use alternate models of interpretation, unite qualitative and quantitative data, apply sociological models to historical patterns, examine more deeply macro-level policies and decisions, and, especially, empathize with the ethnic groups under study.

==Defining the field==
Ethnic history is especially important in the U.S. and Canada. [[Oscar Handlin]] (b. 1915), the director of scores of PhD dissertations at Harvard University was an important pioneer and sponsor of ethnic historiography. Handlin's Pulitzer-prize-winning interpretation, ''[[The Uprooted]]'' (1951) was highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Handler and Mary F. Handler, "The New History and the Ethnic Factor in American Life," ''Perspectives in American History,'' 1970, Vol. 4, pp 5-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Major encyclopedias have helped define the field; Handler sponsored one published by Harvard University Press in 1980 that received wide media attention because it tied in with an American interest in their roots.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.  Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Perin (1983) looks at the historiography of Canadian ethnic history and finds two alternative methodologies. One is more static and emphasizes how closely immigrant cultures replicate the Old World. This approach tends to be filiopietistic. The alternative approach has been influenced by the recent historiography on labor, urban, and family history. It sees the immigrant community as an essentially North American phenomenon and integrates it into the mainstream of Canadian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Perin, "Clio as Ethnic: The Third Force in Canadian Historiography," ''Canadian Historical Review,'' Dec 1983, Vol. 64 Issue 4, pp441-467&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jason J. McDonald|McDonald]] (2007) identifies five main areas of interest for scholarship on U.S. ethnic history: the origins and meaning of ethnicity, particularly the issue of whether it is inherited or invented; the origins of ethnic diversity (such as conquest, immigration, involuntary migration); models of ethnic adaptation (especially the [[Melting pot|Melting Pot]], [[Cultural mosaic|mosaic]], [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] and kaleidoscope metaphors); ethnic incorporation into the social, economic, and political fabric of the receiving country; and minority group survival strategies, including responses to competing forms of allegiance like class and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Jason McDonald. ''American Ethnic History: Themes and Perspectives''. (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-8135-4227-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much research is done by reading the letters immigrants wrote to relatives back home, often comparing the advantages and disadvantages of their new lives.&lt;ref&gt;Walter D. Kamphoefner, "Immigrant Epistolary and Epistemology: On the Motivators and Mentality of Nineteenth-Century German Immigrants." ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2009): 34-54. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40543427 in JSTOR], on deep-reading their letters&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant trend has been to integrate ethnic history with other new historiographical tendencies, such as [[Atlantic history]],&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''British Identities before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[labor history (discipline)|labor history]] or [[women's history]].

'''Euhemerism''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|h|iː|m|ər|ɪ|z|əm|,_|-|h|ɛ|m|-}}) is an approach to the interpretation of [[mythology]] in which mythological accounts are presumed to have originated from real historical events or personages. Euhemerism supposes that historical accounts become myths as they are exaggerated in the retelling, accumulating elaborations and alterations that reflect cultural [[mores]]. It was named for the Greek mythographer [[Euhemerus]], who lived in the late 4th century BC. In the more recent literature of myth, such as ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'', euhemerism is termed the "historical theory" of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Bulfinch, Thomas. ''Bulfinch's Mythology''. Whitefish: Kessinger, 2004, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology in historical terms, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writings including those of [[Xenophanes]], [[Herodotus]], [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] and [[Ephorus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis: "Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete" The Classical Journal 63.8 (May 1968, pp. 337–340) p.338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] presented rationalized accounts of the myth of [[Io (mythology)|Io]] (''Histories'' I.1ff) and events of the Trojan War (''Histories'' 2.118ff).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enduring influence of Euhemerus upon later thinkers such as [[Ennius]] and [[Antoine Banier]] identified him as the traditional founder of this school of thought.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to mythology'', [[Lewis Spence]], 1921, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

In a scene described in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', [[Socrates]] offers a euhemeristic interpretation of a myth concerning [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] and [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]:

{{quote|"{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Tell me, Socrates, isn't it from somewhere near this stretch of the Ilisus that people say Boreas carried Orithyia away?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: So they say.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Couldn't this be the very spot? The stream is lovely, pure and clear: just right for girls to be playing nearby.&lt;br&gt; {{smallcaps|Socrates}}: No, it is two or three hundred yards farther downstream, where one crosses to get to the district of Arga. I think there is even an altar to Boreas there.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: I hadn't noticed it. But tell me, Socrates, in the name of Zeus, do you really believe that legend is true?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: Actually, it would not be out of place for me to reject it, as our intellectuals do. I could then tell a clever story: I could claim that a gust of the North Wind blew her over the rocks where she was playing with Pharmaceia; and once she was killed that way people said she had been carried off by Boreas..."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedr. 229b–d, translation taken from:

Socrates illustrates a euhemeristic approach to the myth of [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] abducting [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]. He shows how the story of Boreas, the northern wind, can be rationalised: Orithyia is pushed off the rock cliffs through the equation of Boreas with a natural gust of wind, which accepts Orithyia as a historical personage. But here he also implies that this is equivalent to rejecting the myth. Socrates, despite holding some euhemeristic views, mocked the concept that all myths could be rationalized, noting that the mythical creatures of "absurd forms" such as [[Centaurs]] and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] could not easily be explained.&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'', 229d&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient [[skeptic]] philosophical tradition of [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]] and the [[Cyrenaics]], Euhemerus forged a new method of interpretation for the contemporary religious beliefs. Though his work is lost, the reputation of Euhemerus was that he believed that much of [[Greek mythology]] could be interpreted as natural or historical events subsequently given supernatural characteristics through retelling. Subsequently Euhemerus was considered to be an [[atheism|atheist]] by his opponents, most notably [[Callimachus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;338–339.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deification===

Euhemerus' views were rooted in the deification of men, usually kings, into gods through [[apotheosis]]. In numerous cultures, kings were exalted or venerated into the status of divine beings and worshipped after their death, or sometimes even while they ruled. [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], the tyrant ruler of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was deified while he was alive and modern scholars consider his apotheosis to have influenced Euhemerus' views on the origin of all gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerus in Context, Franco De Angelis De Angelis and Benjamin Garstad, Classical Antiquity,Vol. 25, No. 2, October 2006, pp. 211–242.&lt;/ref&gt; Euhemerus was also living during the contemporaneous deification of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and "[[pharaoh|pharaoization]]" of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] in a fusion of Hellenic and Egyptian traditions.

===Tomb of Zeus===

Euhemerus argued that [[Zeus]] was a mortal king who died on [[Crete]], and that his tomb could still be found there with the inscription bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete'', S. Spyridakis, The Classical Journal, Vol. 63, No. 8, May, 1968, pp. 337–340.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim however did not originate with Euhemerus, as the general sentiment of Crete during the time of [[Epimenides]] of [[Knossos]] (c.&amp;nbsp;600 BC) was that Zeus was buried somewhere in Crete. For this reason, the Cretans were often considered [[Atheism|atheists]], and Epimenides called them all liars (see [[Epimenides paradox]]). [[Callimachus]], an opponent of Euhemerus' views on [[mythology]], argued that Zeus' Cretan tomb was fabricated, and that he was eternal:

{{cquote|''Cretans always lie.'' For the Cretans even built a tomb,&lt;br&gt; 
Lord, for you. But you did not die, for you are eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Zeus''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A later Latin [[scholia|scholium]] on the ''Hymns'' of Callimachus attempted to account for the tomb of Zeus. According to the scholium, the original tomb inscription read: "The tomb of [[Minos]], the son of [[jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]" but over time the words "Minos, the son" wore away leaving only "the tomb of Jupiter".  This had misled the Cretans into thinking that Zeus had died and was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;The hymns of Callimachus, tr. into Engl. verse, with notes. To which are added, Select epigrams, and the ''Coma Berenices'' of the same author, six hymns of Orpheus, and the ''Encomium of Ptolemy'' by Theocritus, by W. Dodd, 1755, p. 3, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Euhemerus, [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the 3rd century AD claimed that [[Pythagoras]] had discovered the tomb of Zeus on Crete and written on the tomb's surface an inscription reading: "Here died and was buried Zan, whom they call Zeus".&lt;ref&gt;Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religions and Themis a Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion, Jane Ellen Harrison, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] also wrote about the tomb of Zeus.

==Christians==

Hostile to paganism, the early Christians, such as the [[Church Fathers]], embraced euhemerism in attempt to undermine the validity of pagan gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The usefulness of euhemerist views to early Christian apologists may be summed up in [[Clement of Alexandria]]'s triumphant cry in ''Cohortatio ad gentes'': "Those to whom you bow were once men like yourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Seznec (1995) ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'' Princeton University Press pg 12, who observes (p. 13) of the numerous Christian examples he mentions, "Thus Euhemerism became a favorite weapon of the Christian polemicists, a weapon they made use of at every turn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Book of Wisdom===
The ''[[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]]'', a [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]], has a passage, {{bibleref|Wisdom|14:12–21}}, giving a euhemerist explanation of the origin of idols.{{wikisource|Wisdom (Bible)}}

===Early Christian apologists===

The [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Christian apologetics|apologists]] deployed the euhemerist argument to support their position that pagan mythology was merely an aggregate of [[fable]]s of human invention. [[Cyprian]], a North African convert to Christianity, wrote a short essay ''De idolorum vanitate'' ("On the Vanity of Idols") in AD 247 that assumes the euhemeristic rationale as though it needed no demonstration. Cyprian begins:

{{quote|That those are no gods whom the common people worship, is known from this: they were formerly kings, who on account of their royal memory subsequently began to be adored by their people even in death. Thence temples were founded to them; thence images were sculptured to retain the countenances of the deceased by the likeness; and men sacrificed victims, and celebrated festal days, by way of giving them honour. Thence to posterity those rites became sacred, which at first had been adopted as a consolation.}}

Cyprian proceeds directly to examples, the [[apotheosis]] of [[Melicertes]] and [[Leucothea]]; "The Castors [i.e. [[Castor and Pollux]]] die by turns, that they may live," a reference to the daily sharing back and forth of their immortality by the Heavenly Twins. "The cave of Jupiter is to be seen in Crete, and his sepulchre is shown," Cyprian says, confounding Zeus and [[Dionysus]] but showing that the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cave cult was still alive in Crete in the third century AD. In his exposition, it is to Cyprian's argument to marginalize the [[syncretism]] of pagan belief, in order to emphasize the individual variety of local deities:

{{quote|From this the religion of the gods is variously changed among individual nations and provinces, inasmuch as no one god is worshipped by all, but by each one the worship of its own ancestors is kept peculiar.}}

Eusebius in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' employed euhemerism to argue the Babylonian God [[Baʿal]] was a deified ruler and that the god [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] was the first Assyrian king.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicon, Pat. Graeca XIX, cols. 132, 133, i. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euhemeristic views are found expressed also in [[Tertullian]] (''De idololatria''), the ''Octavius'' of [[Marcus Minucius Felix]] and in [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: "Contra Celsum" III 22–43, Harry Y. Gamble, Vigiliae Christianae, Vol. 33, No. 1, Mar., 1979, pp. 12–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]]' dismissal of paganism in the fifth century, on rationalizing grounds, may have depended on a reading of Cyprian, with the details enormously expanded. [[Isidore of Seville]], compiler of the most influential early medieval encyclopedia, devoted a chapter ''De diis gentium''&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''[[Etymologiae]]'', book viii, ch. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; to elucidating, with numerous examples and elaborated genealogies of gods, the principle drawn from [[Lactantius]], ''Quos pagani deos asserunt, homines olim fuisse produntur.'' ("Those whom pagans claim to be gods were once mere men.") Elaborating logically, he attempted to place these deified men in the six great periods of history as he divided it, and created mythological dynasties. Isidore's euhemeristic bent was codified in a rigid parallel with sacred history in [[Petrus Comestor]]'s appendix to his much translated ''Historia scholastica'' (written ca. 1160), further condensing Isidore to provide strict parallels of figures from the pagan [[legend]], as it was now viewed in historicised narrative, and the mighty human spirits of the patriarchs of the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Seznec 1995:16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin of Braga]] in his ''De correctione rusticorum'' wrote idolatry stemmed from post-deluge survivors of Noah's family who began to worship the [[Sun]] and stars instead of [[deity|God]]. In his view the Greek gods were deified descendants of [[Noah]] who were once real personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/pagan4.htm#N_64_|title=Chapter 4: Pagan Survivals in Galicia in the Sixth Century|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

Christian writers during the [[Middle Ages]] continued to embrace euhemerism, such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Petrus Comestor]], [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Godfrey of Viterbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, pp. 396–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] in the 13th century argued that ancient Gods such as [[Minerva]], [[Prometheus]], Atlas, [[Apollo]], [[Io (mythology)|Io]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] were all deified humans. – ''Opus Maius'', ed. J. H. Bridges, Oxford, 1897, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
“After all, it was during this time that Christian apologists had adopted the views of the rationalist Greek philosophers. And had captured the purpose for Euhemerism, which was to explain the mundane origins of the Hellenistic divinities. Euhemerism explained simply in two ways: first in the strictest sense as a movement which reflected the known views of Euhemerus' Hiera Anagraphe regarding Panchaia and the historicity of the family of Saturn and Uranus. The principal sources of these views are the handed-down accounts of Lactantius and Diodorus; or second, in the widest sense, as a rationalist movement which sought to explain the mundane origins of all the Hellenistic gods and heroes as mortals.” Other modern theorists labeled Euhemerism as a “subject of classical paganism that was fostered in the minds of the people of the Middle Ages through the realization that while in most respects the ancient Greeks and Roman had  been superior to themselves, they had been in error regarding their religious beliefs. An examination of the principal writings in Middle English with considerable reading of literature other than English, discloses the fact that the people of the Middle Ages rarely regarded the so-called gods as mere figments of the imagination but rather believed that they were or had been real beings, sometimes possessing actual power.” (John Daniel Cook)

===Christ myth theory===

In his 2011 book, ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', [[Robert M. Price]] supported the [[Christ myth theory]] and suggested that the process of searching for a historical Jesus was like euhemerism.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M, ( 2011) ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', American Atheist Press. {{ISBN|1-57884-017-1}} p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snorri Sturluson's "euhemerism"==
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', composed around 1220, the Christian Icelandic bard and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] proposes that the Norse gods were originally historical leaders and kings. [[Odin]], the father of the gods, is introduced as a historical person originally from [[Asia Minor]], tracing his ancestry back to [[Priam]], the king of [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]]. 
As Odin travels north to settle in the [[Nordic countries]], he establishes the royal families ruling in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] at the time:

{{quote|And whatever countries they passed through, great glory was spoken of them, so that they seemed more like gods than men.&lt;ref&gt;Snorri Sturluson, trans. Anthony Faulkes, ''Edda''. Everyman. 1987. (Prologue, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, while Snorri's euhemerism follows the early Christian tradition, the effect is not simply to discredit the divinity of the gods of a religion on the wane, but also (on the model of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'') to hint that the 'divinisation' was done in order to legitimize more recent Scandinavian rulers.

==In the modern world==

Euhemeristic interpretations of mythology continued throughout the [[early modern period]] from the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;For example in the preface to [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' into English, Golding offers a rationale for contemporary Christian readers to interpret Ovid's pagan stories. He argues: 'The true and everliving God the [[Paynim]]s did not know: Which caused them the name of Gods on creatures to bestow'.&lt;/ref&gt; to modern times. In 1711, the French historian [[Antoine Banier]] in his ''Mythologie et la fable expliqués par l'histoire'' ("The mythology and fables of the ancients, explained") presented strong arguments for a euhemerist interpretation of Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;''The rise of modern mythology, 1680–1860'', Burton Feldman, Robert D. Richardson'', Indiana University Press, 2000, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Bryant]]'s ''A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology'' (1744) was also another key work on euhemerism of the period, but argued so from a Biblical basis. Of the early 19th century, [[George Stanley Faber]] was another Biblical euhemerist. His work ''The Origin of Pagan Idolatry'' (1816) proposed that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were all deified men. Outside of Biblical influenced literature, some archaeologists embraced euhemerist views since they discovered myths could verify archaeological findings. [[Heinrich Schliemann]] was a prominent archaeologist of the 19th century who argued myths had embedded historical truths. Schliemann was an advocate of the historical reality of places and characters mentioned in the works of [[Homer]]. He excavated [[Troy]] and claimed to have discovered artifacts associated with various figures from Greek mythology, including the [[Mask of Agamemnon]] and [[Priam's Treasure]].

[[Herbert Spencer]] embraced some euhemeristic arguments in attempt to explain the anthropocentric origin of religion, through [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]]. Rationalizing methods of interpretation that treat some myths as traditional accounts based upon historical events are a continuous feature of some modern readings of mythology.

The twentieth century poet and mythographer [[Robert Graves]] offered many such "euhemerist" interpretations in his telling of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955). His suggestions that such myths record and justify the political and religious overthrow of earlier cult systems have been widely criticized and are rejected by most scholars.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Juliette|title=The Concept of the Goddess|editor=Sandra Billington, Miranda Green|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=12|chapter=Chapter 1, The Concept of the Goddess|isbn= 9780415197892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=320|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paganism_reader"&gt;''The Paganism Reader''. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=145|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONROLESOF&gt;Davidson, Hilda Ellis (1998).

'''Feudal maintenance''' under [[feudal system]]s of [[government]], was the money payment to [[soldier]]s who fought in the interest and at the command of their [[lord]].  Such soldiers comprised [[Mercenary|private armies]], each with uniquely identifiable [[livery]].  The system of feudal government under which maintenance was paid was most notably present in the late 15th century.

'''{{lang|de|Gründerzeit}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡʁʏndɐˌtsaɪt}}, literally: "founders' period") was the economic phase in 19th-century [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] before the great [[Panic of 1873|stock market crash of 1873]]. At this time in Central Europe the age of [[industrialisation]] was taking place, whose beginnings were found in the 1840s. This period is not precisely dated, but in Austria the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] of 1848 is generally accepted as the beginning of economic changes, in contrast to political reforms. In Germany, as a consequence of the large influx of capital resulting from French [[war reparations]] from the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871, and the subsequent [[unification of Germany]], there followed an [[economic boom]], giving rise to the description of these years as the "founders' years".

These years in Central Europe were a time that citizens increasingly influenced cultural development. This was also the epoch of [[classical liberalism]], even if the political demands of the time were only partially met, and then only in the later period. Industrialisation also posed aesthetic challenges, above all in the fields of architecture and craftsmanship, through development of existing forms, rather than innovation as such.

In common parlance the term ''{{lang|de|Gründerzeitstil}}'' is often mingled with [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], which was the predominant architectural style after 1850 until 1914, leading to a blurring of the terms. In historical context different decades are often also called ''Gründerzeit''. For this reason, the term ''Gründerzeit'' is used to refer to several periods; for example 1850–1873, 1871–1890, sometimes 1850–1914 in reference to the architecture, or just 1871–1873.

== Economy ==
[[File:Borsig 1847.jpg|thumb|Gründerzeit primarily refers to the [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] boom of late 19th-century Germany. Machine and [[railway locomotive|locomotive]] ironworks of ''[[August Borsig|Borsig]] AG'' in [[Berlin]]'s [[Feuerland]], 1847 painting by [[Karl Eduard Biermann]]]]
The German term ''{{lang|de|Gründerzeit}}'' refers to the great economic upswing in the mid-19th century, when the founders of business (''entrepreneurs, {{lang|de|Gründer}}'') could apparently become rich overnight. Of particular importance for speedy economic development was the rise of a developed railway system. Not only was it a major factor in its own right on the business scene of the time, but it also permitted further development through improved communication and migration. Rural migration to the cities assisted the development of a proletariat, with an attendant increase in social problems.

The stock market crash of 1873, combined with economic overheating due to enormous French reparations from the war, put an abrupt end to this upswing, referred to in German as the founders’ crisis (''{{lang|de|Gründerkrise}}''), resulting in a twenty-year period of economic stagnation. This crisis caused the theory of economic liberalism to lose ground, and it was also this time which saw the introduction of business control mechanisms, as well as protective customs tariffs.

The Vienna stock market crash led to the [[Panic of 1873]] in the United States, resulting in the [[Long Depression]].

== Design and architecture ==
{{Main|Historicism (art)}}
[[Image:Tenement Building Callinstrasse Hanover Germany.jpg|thumb|Historicist architecture at [[Hannover-Nordstadt|Nordstadt]] in [[Hanover]]]]
The need for housing rose in consequence of industrialisation. Complete housing developments in the so-called Founding Epoch Architecture style arose in previously green fields, and even today in Central European cities large numbers of buildings from this time can be found together along one single road or even in complete districts. These 4- to 6-story buildings, often constructed by private property developers, often sported richly decorated façades in the form of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] such as Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, German Renaissance and Baroque Revival. Not only magnificent palaces for nouveau-riche citizens were built, but also infamous rental housing for the expanding urban lower classes.

This phase was also important for the integration of new technologies in architecture and design. A determining factor was the development of the [[Bessemer process]] in steel production, which made possible the construction of steel façades. A classical example of this new form is the steel and glass construction of the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], completed in 1851, which was revolutionary for the time and an inspiration to subsequent decades.

== Gründerzeit in Austria ==
In Austria the Gründerzeit began after 1840 with the industrialisation of Vienna, as well as the regions of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]]. Liberalism reached its zenith in Austria in 1867 during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and remained dominant until the mid-1870s.

Vienna, the capital and residence of Emperor Franz Joseph, after the failed uprising of 1848, became the fourth largest city in the world with the inclusion of suburbs and an influx of new residents from regions of Austria. In the place where the city wall had once stood, a [[Ringstraße|ring road]] was built, and ambitious civic buildings—including the [[Vienna State Opera|Opera House]], [[Rathaus, Vienna|Town Hall]], and [[Austrian Parliament Building|Parliament]]—were constructed. In contrast to agricultural workers and urban labourers, an increasingly wealthy upper-middle class built itself monuments and mansions. This occurred on a smaller scale in cities such as Graz, but on the periphery, thereby preserving the old city from destructive redevelopment.

== Gründerzeit in Germany ==
In the mindset of many Germans, the epoch is intrinsically linked with [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] and [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], but it did not end with them (in 1888/1890) but continued well into the reign of Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]]. It was a [[Golden Age]] for Germany in which the disasters of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were remedied, and the country competed internationally on a world-class level in the domains of science, technology, industry and commerce. This was the time when particularly the German middle class rapidly increased their standard of living, buying modern furniture, kitchen fittings and household machines.

The social effects of Industrialization were the same as in other European nations: Increased agricultural efficiency and introduction of new agricultural machines led to a polarized distribution of income in the countryside. The landowners won out to the disadvantage of the agrarian [[proletariat|unpropertied workforce]]. Emigration, most of all to America, and urbanization were a consequence.

[[Image:Aachen-ElegantStreet.JPG|thumb|220px|Typical Aachen street with early 20th-century {{lang|de|Gründerzeit}} houses]]
[[File:Typical Aachen street with early 20th-century Gründerzeit houses (2).JPG|thumb|Another example of Aachen early 20th-century Gründerzeit houses]]
In the rapidly growing industrial cities, new workers' dwellings were erected, lacking in comfort by today's standards but also criticized as unhealthy by physicians of the time: "without light, air and sun", quite contrary to the then prevailing ideas on town planning. The dark, cramped flats took a large part of the blame for the marked increase in [[tuberculosis]], which spread also to wealthier neighborhoods.

Nevertheless, the working class also saw improvements of living standards and other conditions, such as [[social security]] through laws on workers' [[health insurance]] and [[accident insurance]] introduced by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] in 1883/1884, and in the long run also through the foundation of a [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] that would remain the model for the European sister parties until [[Hitler]]'s ''[[Machtübernahme]]'' in 1933. Even today the model of social care developed by Bismarck in 1873 ([[:de:Reichsversicherungsordnung|Reichsversicherungsordnung]]) remains the contractual basis for health insurance in Germany.

The '''Heyward Shepherd memorial''' was erected in 1931 by the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. It commemorates Heyward (sometimes spelled "Hayward") Shepherd (1825–October 16, 1859), a free black man, who was the first person killed during [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]].
[[File:Heyward shepherd, a black porter who was the first killed during John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.jpg|thumb|This is from a 1906 book by Elijah Avey, ''The Capture and Execution of John Brown''.

==Heyward Shepherd==
Heyward Shepherd was a free black man who lived in [[Winchester, Virginia]], about {{convert|30|mi}} from Harpers Ferry. He owned property there, a small house, and had a wife and five children, according to the 1860 census. "It is unclear whether Shepherd was born a free man or was an emancipated slave because various anecdotal references present different opinions on that subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article

He had a job as a porter or baggage handler with the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], and worked on the trains going back and forth through Harpers Ferry, an important rail junction. When the stationmaster was absent, he was in charge of the station. During the early hours of the raid on October 16, 1859, he recognized Brown's party, and tried to warn the town instead of helping the liberators. The raiders unexpectedly met Heyward, and ordered him to stop when he turned to run. When he failed to stop, he was shot in the back and/or the head, and killed. He was buried in the Winchester-Fairfax Colored Cemetery, without a grave marker. He was "accorded public honors by the state of Virginia, his funeral being attended by a detachment of the Virginia State militia."&lt;ref&gt;

===1931 Monument===
In 1931 a monument to Shepherd {{nowrap|({{coord|39.32330|-77.73005|format=dms|type:landmark_region:US-WV|display=inline}})}} was erected by both the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. The text of the granite monument read: &lt;blockquote&gt;On the night of October 16, 1859, Heyward Shepherd, an industrious and respected colored freeman, was mortally wounded by John Brown's raiders, in pursuance of his duties as an employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, he became the first victim of this attempted insurrection. This boulder is erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans as a memorial to Heyward Shepherd, exemplifying the character and faithfulness of thousands of Negros who under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war. So conducted themselves that no stain was left upon a record which is the peculiar heritage of the American people, and an everlasting tribute to the best in both races.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1932 Plaque===
The monument was immediately challenged by many as perpetuating the "faithful slave" concept of slavery as a justification for the practice.

The NAACP responded by preparing a plaque to be displayed at [[Storer College]] in Harpers Ferry, where the firehouse used by John Brown as a fort had been placed. The president of the college refused to allow the plaque to be mounted because of the militant text. In 2006 the plaque was finally placed on the side of the firehouse. The text of the plaque reads:&lt;blockquote&gt; HERE JOHN BROWN AIMED AT HUMAN SLAVERY A BLOW THAT WOKE A GUILTY NATION. WITH HIM FOUGHT SEVEN SLAVES AND SONS OF SLAVES. OVER HIS CRUCIFIED CORPSE MARCHED 200,000 BLACK SOLDIERS AND 4,000,000 FREEDMEN SINGING  "JOHN BROWN'S BODY LIES A-MOULDERING IN THE GRAVE BUT HIS SOUL GOES MARCHING ON!" IN GRATITUDE THIS TABLET IS ERECTED THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE MAY 21, 1932&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1955 Plaque===
A plaque to contexualize the original 1931 monument was placed in 1955 by the National Park Service. The text of the plaque read: &lt;blockquote&gt;John Brown’s raid on the armory at Harpers Ferry caused the death of four townspeople. One of those died in the fighting was Heyward Shepherd, a railroad baggagemaster and a free black. Although the true identity of his assailant is uncertain, Shepherd soon became a symbol of the "faithful servant" among those who deplored Brown’s action against the traditional southern way of life. This monument, placed here in 1931, reflects those traditional views.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1994 Plaque===
Another plaque was installed near the 1931 monument to place the monument in context by the National Park Service. It reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;On October 17, 1859, abolitionist John Brown attacked Harpers Ferry to launch a war against slavery. Heyward Shepherd, a free African-American railroad baggage master, was shot and killed by Brown’s men shortly after midnight. Seventy-two years later, on October 10, 1931, a crowd estimated to 300 whites and 100 blacks gathered to unveil and dedicate the Shepherd Monument. During the ceremony, voices rose to praise and denounce the monument. Conceived around the turn of the century, the monument endured controversy. In 1905, the United Daughters of the Confederacy stated that erecting the monument would influence for good the present and coming generations, and prove that the people of the South who owned slaves valued and respected their good qualities as no one else ever did or will do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Horned God.JPG|thumb|A sculpture of the Horned God Bucca of Cornish traditional witchcraft, found in the [[Museum of Witchcraft]] in [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]].]]

The '''Horned God''' is one of the two primary deities found in [[Wicca]] and some related forms of [[Neopaganism]]. 
The term ''Horned God'' itself predates Wicca, and is an early 20th-century [[syncretism|syncretic]] term for a horned or antlered anthropomorphic god with partly [[pseudohistorical]] origins, partly based on historical [[Horned deity|horned deities]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Bailey ''Witchcraft Historiography (review)'' in Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft - Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp. 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horned God represents the [[God (Wicca)|male part]] of the religion's [[Wiccan ditheism|duotheistic theological system]], the [[Prince consort|consort]] of the female [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of the Moon or other [[Mother Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druidry.org/library/gods-goddesses/horned-god-unofficial-autobiography |title=from the library of the Order of Bards, Ovates &amp; Druids |publisher=Druidry.org |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In common Wiccan belief, he is associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality, hunting, and the life cycle.&lt;ref name=farrargod&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |first=Janet |last=Farrar |author2=Farrar, Stewart |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-3319-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–34}} Whilst depictions of the deity vary, he is always shown with either [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s or [[antler]]s upon his head, often depicted as being [[Theriocephaly|theriocephalic]] (having a beast's head), in this way emphasizing "the union of the divine and the animal", the latter of which includes [[human]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horns of Power |publisher=Avalonia |location=London |first=Sorita |last=d'Este |year=2008 |pages=|isbn=1-905297-17-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

In traditional Wicca ([[British Traditional Wicca]]), he is generally regarded as a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] god of twofold aspects: bright and dark, night and day,  summer and winter,  the Oak King and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]].  In this dualistic view, his two horns symbolize, in part, his dual nature.  (The use of horns to symbolize duality is also reflected in the phrase "on the horns of a dilemma.") The three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned God are sometimes mapped on to the five points of the [[Pentagram]],  although which points correspond  to which deity aspects  varies. In some other systems, he is represented as a [[triple deities|triune]] [[god]], split into three aspects that reflect those of the Triple Goddess: the [[wikt:youth|Youth]] ([[Warrior]]), the [[wikt:father|Father]], and the [[Sage (philosophy)|Sage]].

The Horned God has been explored within several [[psychology|psychological]] theories and has become a recurrent theme in [[fantasy]] literature.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia_of_fantasy"&gt;

==In Wicca==
[[File:Gundestrup Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|The "Cernunnos" type antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]]]]

In traditional and mainstream Wicca, the Horned God is viewed as the divine male principality, being both equal and opposite to the Goddess. The Wiccan god himself can be represented in many forms, including as the [[Solar deity|Sun God]], the Sacrificed God and the Vegetation God,&lt;ref name="farrargod"/&gt; although the Horned God is the most popular representation. The pioneers of the various Wiccan or Witchcraft traditions, such as [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], [[Doreen Valiente]] and [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]], all claimed that their religion was a continuation of the [[Paganism|pagan]] religion of the [[Witch-Cult]] following historians who had purported the Witch-Cult's existence, such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Margaret Murray]].

For Wiccans, the Horned God is "the personification of the life force energy in animals and the wild"&lt;ref&gt;"Starhawk" in News-Week On-faith [http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/starhawk/2006/11/some_basic_definitions.html Some basic definitions] 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with [[Lord of the animals|the wilderness]], virility and [[Hunting God|the hunt]].&lt;ref name="Davy"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} [[Doreen Valiente]] writes that the Horned God also [[Psychopomp|carries the souls of the dead to the underworld]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

Wiccans generally, as well as some other neopagans, tend to conceive of the universe as polarized into gender opposites of [[masculinity|male]] and [[femininity|female]] [[Energy (esotericism)|energies]]. In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently the symbolism of the Horned God is less developed than that of the [[Goddess (Wicca)|Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Wicca the cycle of the seasons is celebrated during eight sabbats called The [[Wheel of the Year]]. The seasonal cycle is imagined to follow the relationship between the Horned God and the Goddess.&lt;ref name="Davy" /&gt; The Horned God is born in winter, impregnates the Goddess and then dies during the autumn and winter months and is then reborn by the Goddess at Yule.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The different relationships throughout the year are sometimes distinguished by splitting the god into aspects, the Oak King and the Holly King.&lt;ref name="Davy" /&gt; The relationships between the Goddess and the Horned God are mirrored by Wiccans in seasonal rituals. There is some variation between Wiccan groups as to which sabbat corresponds to which part of the cycle. Some Wiccans regard the Horned God as dying at Lammas, August 1; also known as Lughnasadh, which is the first harvest sabbat. Others may see him dying at Mabon, the [[autumn equinox]], or the second harvest festival. Still other Wiccans conceive of the Horned God dying on October 31, which Wiccans call [[Samhain]], the ritual of which is focused on death. He is then reborn on Winter Solstice, December 21.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] says (in 1959's ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'') that The Horned God is an Under-god, a mediator between an unknowable supreme deity and the people. (In Wiccan liturgy in the Book of Shadows, this conception of an unknowable supreme deity is referred to as "Dryghtyn." It is not a personal god, but rather an impersonal divinity similar to the Tao of Taoism.)

Whilst the Horned God is the most common depiction of masculine divinity in Wicca, he is not the only representation. Other examples include the [[Green Man]] and the [[solar deity|Sun God]].&lt;ref name=farrargod/&gt; In traditional Wicca, however, these other representations of the Wiccan god are subsumed or amalgamated into the Horned God, as aspects or expressions of him. Sometimes this is shown by adding horns or antlers to the iconography. The Green Man, for example, may be shown with branches resembling antlers; and the Sun God may be depicted with a crown or halo of solar rays, that may resemble horns. These other conceptions of the Wiccan god should not be regarded as displacing the Horned God, but rather as elaborating on various facets of his nature. Doreen Valiente has called the Horned God "the eldest of gods" in both The Witches Creed and also in her Invocation To The Horned God.

Wiccans believe that The Horned God, as Lord of Death, is their "comforter and consoler" after death and before reincarnation; and that he rules the [[Underworld]] or [[The Summerland|Summerland]] where the souls of the dead reside as they await rebirth. Some, such as Joanne Pearson, believe that this is based on the [[Mesopotamian]] myth of [[Inanna]]'s [[Inanna#Inanna's descent to the underworld|descent into the underworld]], though this has not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Doreen Valiente]], a former High Priestess of the [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian tradition]], claimed that Gerald Gardner's [[Bricket Wood coven]] referred to the god as [[Cernunnos]], or '''Kernunno''', which is a Latin word, discovered on a [[pillar of the Boatmen|stone carving found in France]], meaning "the Horned One". Valiente claimed that the coven also referred to the god as '''Janicot''',{{needs IPA}} which she theorised was of [[Basque language|Basque]] origin, and Gardner also used this name in his novel ''High Magic's Aid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Rebirth of Witchcraft |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |first=Doreen |last=Valiente |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-8369-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}}

[[Stewart Farrar]], a High Priest of the [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian tradition]] referred to the Horned God as Karnayna, which he believed was a corruption of the word Cernunnos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=What Witches Do |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |first=Stewart |last=Farrar |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-9014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] has suggested that it instead came from the Arabic term [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] which meant "Horned One". This term had been used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] to refer to [[Cyrus the Great]] or alternatively [[Alexander the Great]], who considered himself the son of the horned deity Ammon-Zeus, and wore horns as a part of his regalia. Margaret Murray had mentioned this information in her 1933 book ''The God of the Witches'', and Hutton theorised that [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] had taken it from there, enjoying the fact that he shared his name with the ancient Macedonian emperor.&lt;ref name="triumph"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Triumph of the Moon: a History of Modern Pagan Witchcaraft |publisher=Oxford Paperbacks |first=Ronald |last=Hutton |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-19-285449-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}}

In the writings of [[Charles Cardell]] and [[Raymond Howard (Wiccan)|Raymond Howard]], the god was referred to as '''Atho'''. Howard had a wooden statue of Atho's head which he claimed was 2200 years old, but the statue was stolen in April 1967. Howard's son later admitted that his father had carved the statue himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/coven_of_atho%20article.htm#_ednref22 |title=The Coven of Atho |publisher=Thewica.co.uk |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z8swU6zn?url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/coven_of_atho%20article.htm |archivedate=2015-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cochrane's Craft]], which was founded by [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], the Horned God was often referred to by a Biblical name; [[Tubal-cain]], who, according to the [[Bible]] was the first blacksmith.&lt;ref name="Roebuck"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Mike |last=Howard |title=The Roebuck in the Thicket: An Anthology of the Robert Cochrane Witchcraft Tradition |publisher=Capall Bann Publishing |isbn=1-86163-155-3 |year=2001 }} Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; In this neopagan concept, the god is also referred to as [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]], a Welsh mythological figure, [[Wayland the Smith|Wayland]], the smith in Germanic mythology, and [[Herne the Hunter|Herne]], a horned figure from [[English folklore]].&lt;ref name="Roebuck"/&gt;

In the neopagan tradition of [[Stregheria]], founded by [[Raven Grimassi]] and loosely inspired by the works of [[Charles Godfrey Leland]], the Horned God goes by several names, including [[Janus|Dianus]], [[Faunus]], Cern, and [[Actaeon]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Jungian analysis===
[[File:Gehörnter Gott, Enkomi.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze figurine of a "Horned God" from [[Enkomi]], Cyprus]]

Sherry Salman considers the image of the Horned God in [[Jungian]] terms, as an archetypal protector and mediator of the outside world to the objective psyche. In her theory the male psyche's 'Horned God' frequently compensates for inadequate fathering.

When first encountered, the figure is a dangerous, 'hairy chthonic wildman' possessed of kindness and intelligence. If [[psychological repression|repressed]], later in life The Horned God appears as the lord of the Otherworld, or [[Hades]]. If split off entirely, he leads to violence, substance abuse and sexual perversion. When integrated he gives the male an ego 'in possession of its own destructiveness' and for the female psyche gives an effective [[anima and animus|animus]] relating to both the physical body and the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the Horned God as a symbol recurring in women's literature, Richard Sugg suggests the Horned God represents the 'natural Eros', a masculine lover subjugating the social-conformist nature of the female shadow, thus encompassing a combination of the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] and animus. One such example is [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] from [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. Sugg goes on to note that female characters who are paired with this character usually end up socially ostracised, or worse &amp;ndash; in an inverted ending to the male hero-story.&lt;ref&gt;

[[horned deity|Many horned deities]] are known to have been worshipped in various cultures throughout history. Evidence for horned gods appear very early in the human record.  The so-called [[The Sorcerer (cave art)|Sorcerer]] dates from perhaps 13,000 BCE.  Twenty-one red deer headdresses, made from the skulls of the [[red deer]] and likely fitted with leather laces, have been uncovered at the Mesolithic site of [[Star Carr]].  They are thought to date from roughly 9,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/mesolithic_headdress |title=British Museum headdresses |website= |publisher=Trustees of the British Museum |access-date=2018-01-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several theories have been created to establish historical roots for modern [[Neopagan]] worship of a Horned God.

===Margaret Murray===
Following the writings of [[suffragist]] [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and others, [[Margaret Murray]], in her 1921 book ''[[The Witch-Cult in Western Europe]]'', proposed the theory that the witches of the early-modern period were remnants of a pagan cult and that the Christian Church had declared the god of the witches was in fact [[the Devil]]. Without recourse to any specific representation of this deity, Murray speculates that the head coverings common in [[inquisition]]-derived descriptions of the devil "may throw light on one of the possible origins of the cult."&lt;ref name="MurrayWitch"&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Margaret Murray |last=Murray |first=Margaret |title=The Witch-cult in Western Europe (1921)|year=2006|publisher=Standard Publications|isbn=1-59462-126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nejamesa horned god of India.png|thumb|left|Horned God [[Naigamesha]] of the Indian sub-religion [[Kaumaram]]. Possibly from the Shunga period (1st-2nd century B.C), or earlier]]
In 1931 Murray published a sequel, ''The God of the Witches'', which tries to gather evidence in support of her witch-cult theory. In Chapter 1 "The Horned God".&lt;ref name="MurraGod"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Murray |first=Margaret |title=The God of the Witches (1931)|year=1970|isbn=0-19-501270-4|publisher=OUA USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray claims that various depictions of humans with horns from [[Europe]]an and [[India]]n sources, ranging from the [[paleolithic]] French cave painting of "[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer]]" to the Indic [[Pashupati]] to the modern English [[Dorset Ooser]], are evidence for an unbroken, Europe-wide tradition of worship of a singular Horned God. Murray derived this model of a horned god cult from [[James Frazer]] and [[Jules Michelet]].&lt;ref&gt;

In dealing with "[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer]]",&lt;ref name=MurrayWitch/&gt;{{rp|23–4}} the earliest evidence claimed, Murray based her observations on a drawing by [[Henri Breuil]], which some modern scholars such as Ronald Hutton claim is inaccurate. Hutton states that modern photographs show the original cave art lacks horns, a human torso or any other significant detail on its upper half.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}  However, others, such as celebrated prehistorian [[Jean Clottes]], assert that Breuil's sketch is indeed accurate.  Clottes stated that "I have seen it myself perhaps 20 times over the years".&lt;ref name="Cave Art Cobblers?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/07/06/cave-art-cobblers/|title=Cave Art Cobblers? - Beachcombing's Bizarre History Blog|date=6 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breuil considered his drawing to represent a shaman or magician - an interpretation which gives the image its name. Murray having seen the drawing called Breuil's image "the first depiction of a deity", an idea which Breuil and others later adopted.

Murray also used an inaccurate drawing of a [[mesolithic]] rock-painting at [[El Cogul|Cogul]] in northeast Spain as evidence of group religious ceremony of the cult, although the central male figure is not horned.&lt;ref name=MurrayWitch/&gt;{{rp|65}} The illustration she used of the Cogul painting leaves out a number of figures, human and animal, and the original is more likely a sequence of superimposed but unrelated illustrations, rather than a depiction of a single scene.&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;{{rp|197}}

Despite widespread criticism of Murray's scholarship some minor aspects of her work continued to have supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg |title=Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;"Other historians, like Byloff and Bonomo, have been willing to build upon the useful aspects of Murray's work without adopting its untenable elements, and the independent and careful researches of contemporary scholars have lent aspects of the Murray thesis considerable new strength." — J. B. Russell (1972) ''Witchcraft in the Middle Ages''. Cornell University Press. p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influences from literature====
The popular image of the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] was removed from its classical context in the writings of the [[Romantics]] of the 18th century and connected with their ideals of a pastoral England. This, along with the general public's increasing lack of familiarity of [[Greek mythology]] at the time led to the figure of Pan becoming generalised as a 'horned god', and applying connotations to the character, such as benevolence that were not evident in the original Greek myths which in turn gave rise to the popular acceptance of Murray's hypothetical horned god of the witches.&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;

{{Main|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches#Influence on Wicca and Stregheria}}
The reception of ''Aradia'' amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of [[Leo Martello]] and [[Raven Grimassi]], must be "match[ed] against", and compared with the claims in ''Aradia''. He further suggests that a lack of comfort with ''Aradia'' may be due to an "insecurity" within Neopaganism about the movement's claim to authenticity as a religious revival.&lt;ref name="Clifton"&gt;

Valiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of [[Lucifer]] as the god of the witches in ''Aradia'' was "too strong meat" for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name="Valiente61"&gt;[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]], quoted in Clifton, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis#Post-Murray}}
In 1985 Classical historian [[Georg Luck]], in his ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining [[pagan]]s, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the [[Devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt;

====Influences from occultism====
[[Image:Baphomet.png|thumb|upright|The 19th century image of a Sabbatic Goat, created by [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]]. Baphomet serves as an historical model for Murray's concept.]]

Eliphas Levi's image of "[[Baphomet]]" serves as an example of the transformation of the Devil into a benevolent fertility deity and provided the prototype for Murray's horned god.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Murray's central thesis that images of the Devil were actually of [[deities]] and that [[Christianity]] had demonised these worshippers as following [[Satan]], is first recorded in the work of Levi in the fashionable 19th-century [[Occult]]ist circles of England and France.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Juliette Wood, "[http://www.juliettewood.com/papers/Tarot.pdf The Celtic Tarot and the Secret Traditions: A Study in Modern Legend Making]": ''Folklore'', Vol. 109, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Levi created his image of Baphomet, published in his ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' (1855), by combining symbolism from diverse traditions, including the ''[[The Devil (Tarot card)|Diable]]'' card of the 16th and 17th century [[Tarot of Marseille]]. Lévi called his image "The Goat of Mendes", possibly following [[Herodotus]]' account&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' ii. 42, 46 and 166.&lt;/ref&gt; that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat's face and legs.  Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly [[Zoophilia|copulated with a goat]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' ii. 46. [[Plutarch]] specifically associates [[Osiris]] with the "goat at Mendes." [http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th140.htm ''De Iside et Osiride'', lxxiii.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] writes,

{{quote|At several places in the Delta, e.g. Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, the god Pan and a goat were worshipped; Strabo, quoting (xvii. 1, 19) Pindar, says that in these places goats had intercourse with women, and Herodotus (ii. 46) instances a case which was said to have taken place in the open day. The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity. Diodorus ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html#ref32 i. 88]) compares the cult of the goat of Mendes with that of Priapus, and groups the god with the Pans and the Satyrs. The goat referred to by all these writers is the famous Mendean Ram, or Ram of Mendes, the cult of which was, according to Manetho, established by Kakau, the king of the IInd dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SBLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|title=The Gods of the Egyptians: Or, Studies in Egyptian Mythology|first=Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis|last=Budge|date=28 July 2018|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Historically, the deity that was venerated at Egyptian Mendes was a ram deity [[Banebdjedet]] (literally Ba of the lord of djed, and titled "the Lord of Mendes"), who was the soul of [[Osiris]]. Lévi combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles Devil card and refigured the ram ''Banebdjed'' as a he-goat, further imagined by him as "copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes".

===Gerald Gardner and Wicca===
[[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of the historical origins of the Horned God has been used by Wiccans to create a myth of historical origins for their religion.&lt;ref name="Davy"/&gt;{{rp|110}}  There is no verifiable evidence to support claims that the religion originates earlier than the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="triumph"/&gt;

{{Main|Wicca#Theology}}
Modern scholarship has disproved Margaret Murray's theory, however various horned gods and mother goddesses were indeed worshipped in the British Isles during the ancient and early Medieval periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles |publisher=Blackwell |location= |first=Ronald |last=Hutton |year=1991 |pages=260–261 |isbn=0-631-17288-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "father of Wicca", [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who adopted Margaret Murray's thesis, claimed Wicca was a modern survival of an ancient pan-European pagan religion.&lt;ref name="NatureRelToday"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLYCOOUlsBcC&amp;pg=PA6#PPA6,M1 |title=Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World |first=Joanne |last=Pearson |author2=Roberts, Richard H |author3=Samuel, Geoffrey  |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |page=172 |date=December 1998 |isbn=0-7486-1057-X |oclc=39533917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner states that he had reconstructed elements of the religion from fragments, incorporating elements from [[Freemasonry]], the [[Occult]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], which came together in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], where Gardner met [[Aleister Crowley]], whose influence became the basis for Wiccan magical practices.&lt;ref&gt;

Gerald Gardner was initiated into [[Ordo Templi Orientis|the O.T.O.]] by Aleister Crowley and subsequently went on to found the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Various scholars on early Wiccan history, such as [[Ronald Hutton]], [[Philip Heselton]], and [[Leo Ruickbie]] concur that witchcraft's early rituals, as devised by Gardner, contained much from Crowley's writings such as the [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]]. The third degree initiation ceremony in Gardnerian Wicca (including the [[Great Rite]]) is derived almost completely from the Gnostic Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eocto.org/article/101 |title=Ecclesia Ordinis Caelestis Templum Olympicus - Thelemic Origins of Wicca |publisher=Eocto.org |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romano-Celtic fusion===
Georg Luck, repeats part of Murray's theory, stating that the Horned God may have appeared in late antiquity, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], an antlered god of the Continental Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name="LuckArcana"&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Georg Luck |last=Luck |first=Georg |year=1985 |title=Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts. |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of [[Devil|the devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name="LuckArcana"/&gt;

==Art, fantasy and science fiction==
[[Image:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Witches' Sabbath - WGA10007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco de Goya]]'s ''[[Witches' Sabbath (1789)|Witches Sabbat]]'' (1789), which depicts [[the Devil]] flanked by Satanic witches. The Witch Cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god]]

In 1908's ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]], in Chapter 7, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", Ratty and Mole meet a mystical horned being, powerful, fearsome and kind.&lt;ref name="Clifton"/&gt;{{rp|85}} Grahame's work was a significant part of the cultural milieu which stripped the Greek god Pan of his cultural identity in favor of an unnamed, generic horned deity which led to Murray's thesis of historical origins.

Outside of works that predate the publication of Murray's thesis, horned god motifs and characters appear in fantasy literature that draws upon her work and that of her followers.

In the novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' (1953) by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], all humans have a collective premonition, also described as a memory of the future, of horned aliens which arrive to usher in a new phase of human evolution. The collective subconscious image of the horned aliens is what accounts for mankind's image of the devil or Satan. This theme is also explored in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Dæmons]]'' in 1971,  where the local superstitions around a landmark known as The Devil's Hump prove to be based on reality, as aliens from the planet Dæmos have been affecting man's progress over the millennia and the Hump actually contains a spacecraft.  The only Dæmon to appear is a classic interpretation of a horned satyr-like being with hooves.

In the critically acclaimed and influential 1950s TV series created by [[Nigel Kneale]], ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', depictions of supernatural horned entities, with specific reference to prehistoric cave-art and shamanistic horned head-dress are revealed to be a "race-memory" of psychic [[Martian]] grasshoppers, manifested at the climax of the film by a fiery horned god.&lt;ref&gt;White, Eric (1996) ''Once they were men: Now they're Landcrabs: Monsterous Becomings in Evolutionist Cinema'', in

[[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], who acknowledges the influence of Murray, uses the figure of the "horned god" in her feminist fantasy transformation of [[King Arthur|Arthurian myth]], ''[[Mists of Avalon]]'' (1984), and portrays ritualistic incest between King Arthur as the representative of the horned god and his sister [[Morgan le Fay|Morgaine]] as the "spring maiden".&lt;ref&gt;

In the popular video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind|Morrowind]]'', its expansion ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon|Bloodmoon]]'' has a plot enemy known as Hircine, the Daedric god of the Hunt, who appears as a horned man with the face of a deer skull. He condemned his "hounds" ([[werewolves]]) to walk the mortal ground during the Bloodmoon until a champion defeats him or Bloodmoon falls. When in combat, Hircine appears as a horned wolf or bear.

The 1992 ''[[Discworld]]'' novel ''[[Lords and Ladies (novel)|Lords and Ladies]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]], features a King of the Elves who is strongly reminiscent of the Horned God.  Although not worshipped by [[Witches (Discworld)|the witches]] who are the heroines of the book (indeed, quite the reverse), they temporarily ally themselves with him out of necessity.

'''Joan Kent Dillon''' (30 April 1925 – 18 January 2009) was a teacher, a nationally known [[historic preservation]] activist and an author.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Joan Kent was born 30 April 1925 in Lafayette, Indiana, to Gladys and Richard Kent of Tuxedo Park, New York.&lt;ref name="GlobeObit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Negri |first=Gloria |date=16 March 2009 |title=Joan Kent Dillon, at 83; Was Theater Preservation Activist |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/03/16/joan_kent_dillon_at_83_was_theater_preservation_activist/ |newspaper=Boston Globe |location=Boston, Mass. |publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCTObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituaries: Joan Kent Dillon, 83 |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090129/OBITS02/901290337 |newspaper=Cape Cod Times |location=Hyannis, Mass. |publisher=Local Media Group, Inc. |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, spending summers at the family's summer home in Whalewalk Farm, [[Orleans, Massachusetts]]. She attended [[Wheeler School]] in Providence, Rhode Island but graduated from [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Mary Institute]] in St. Louis in 1943.  Dillon earned a Bachelor of Arts from [[Smith College]] in 1947. Her husband-to-be, George Chaffee Dillon of Liberty, Missouri, had served in the Navy during the Second World War, rising to the rank of Lt. Commander, then receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School. They met in Cambridge and married on 11 September 1948. That same year the couple moved to Kansas City, Missouri where George went to work first for J. Bruening &amp; Co. then Butler Manufacturing in 1949, eventually becoming president and chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="GeorgeObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: George C. Dillon |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/wickedlocal-orleans/obituary.aspx?pid=163242974 |newspaper=Cape Codder |location=Orleans, Mass. |publisher=Gatehouse Media, Inc. |date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dillons had two daughters and a son. Joan Dillon went on to complete a Masters Degree in Medieval History at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1969 with a thesis on Medieval architecture.&lt;ref name="GlobeObit" /&gt; From 1962 to 1971 she taught Ancient and Medieval History at Sunset Hill School (now [[The Pembroke Hill School]]).

===The Folly Theater===
[[File:Folly Theater burlesk.jpg|thumb|280p|right|The [[Folly Theater]] in 1973 as a burlesque house, 300 W. 12th St., Kansas City, Missouri, as documented by the [[Heritage Documentation Programs|Historic American Buildings Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loc.gov/pictures/item/mo0438/ |title=Standard Theatre, 300 West Twelfth Street, Kansas City, Jackson County, MO |date= |series=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division, Washington, D.C. |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Folly Theater]] is a historic theater in Kansas City, Missouri. It originally opened as the Standard Theater on 23 September 1900 and featured on the burlesque and vaudeville circuit.  Business started declining in 1928 and the theater was closed between 1932 and 1941. The theater began showing adult movies in 1969 but continued to physically decline. The balcony had been closed by the fire marshall in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028192142/http://www.follytheater.com/history_restoration.html |archive-date= 28 October 2002 |url=http://www.follytheater.org/history_restoration.html |deadurl=yes |title=Folly Theater History: Restoration / Renovation (1974-November 1981) |author= |website=Folly Theater |accessdate=22 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater again closed in January 1974.  The theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York, announced that if a buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot.&lt;ref name="APReprieve"&gt;{{cite news |last=Associated Press |date=February 15, 1975 |title=Historic Showhouse Gets Reprieve |newspaper=The Evening Standard |location=Uniontown, Penn. |publisher=Uniontown Newspapers, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of local historic preservation activists, including Dillon and [[William N. Deramus III]], formed the nonprofit Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. The Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation.&lt;ref name="APReprieve" /&gt;

Folly Theater was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Jackson County, Missouri: Downtown Kansas City|National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.

But preventing the building from being demolished was just the beginning. The building was in a considerable state of disrepair. Most of the windows were broken. A chandelier had fallen onto the balcony. Pornographic magazines rotted in closets. Nineteen tones of pigeon dung would be removed from the building. Between 1974 and 1987 Dillon and the Performing Arts Foundation raised $5 million for the restoration of the theater, including a $1 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The theater was reopened in 1981. A plaque was mounted on the stage recognizing Joan Dillon's work in saving the Folly Theater. A pair of plaster pigeons installed above the box office by architect Bob Berkebile are named Joan and George after the Dillons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/1439 |title=Folly Theater |last1=Francis |first1=Donna |website=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A national role===
Her work saving and restoring the Folly Theater made Dillon a nationally known historic preservation advocate. She became a board member of the [[The Broadway League|League of Historic American Theaters]] from 1978-1981 and 1992-1998, the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] from 1980-1990, President Reagan's [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities|Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] from 1982-1990 and the Smithsonian National Board from 1989-1995.&lt;ref name="StarObit"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Obituary: Joan Dillon |newspaper=Kansas City Star |location=Hyannis, Mass. |publisher=Local Media Group, Inc. |date=28 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her board and committee work required frequent travel to Washington, D.C.

===''American Theaters''===
For a number of years Dillon had been thinking about a book documenting America's nineteenth century historic theaters.  Through her work on historic preservation, Dillon met architectural historian [[David Arthur Naylor (architectural historian)|David Naylor]]. Naylor had already produced two books on movie theaters, ''American Picture Palaces: The Architecture of Fantasy'' (1981) and ''Great American Movie Theaters'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sah.org/about-sah/sah-news/2013/03/01/obituary-david-naylor |title=Obituary: David Naylor |last1=Maddex |first1=Diane |date=1 March 2013 |website=Society of Architectural Historians |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the years 1994-1996 the two worked together on Dillon's idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1344 |title=Joan Dillon papers, |last1=Curtis |first1=Peter |last2=Archer |first2=Joanne |date=October 2003 |publisher=University of Maryland Libraries |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began by contacting one thousand five hundred theaters by telephone and postcard. They then sent a follow-up questionnaire to more than a thousand from the first list. The two then traveled extensively with one or both Dillon and Naylor eventual visiting two hundred and fifty theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Joan |last2=Naylor |first2=David |date=1997 |title=American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=0-471-14393-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the two arrived upon a list of forty theaters, arranged into seven broad categories, they deemed representative of the breadth of American nineteenth century theaters (see [[Joan Dillon (historic preservation activist)#American Theaters 2|next section]] for detail on their list and categories). The record of their survey, ''American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century'', was published in 1997.

===Later life===
Throughout her life Dillon continued to spend summers in Cape Cod. In 1976 she bought a home in North Chatham, Massachusetts. Dillon continued her historic preservation activities in the Cape Cod region. She worked in Acquisitions for the [[Cape Cod Museum of Art]] from 2007-2009.&lt;ref name="StarObit" /&gt; In 2007 she published ''Barns of Cape Cod'' with her son, Kent C. Dillon and photographer Blandon Belushin.&lt;ref name="barns"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dillon |first=Joan |last2=Dillon |first2=Kent C. |last3=Belushin |first3=Blandon |date=2007 |title=Barns of Cape Cod |location=Atglen, Penn. |publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=9780764325649}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the last ten years of her life she lived in Cape Cod permanently&lt;ref name="CCTObit" /&gt; and it was in her home there that Joan Dillon died at the age of 83 of leukemia and cardiac arrest on 18 January 2009.

==American Theaters==
After a brief historical essay, the bulk of the book consists of the section, "A Revue of Nineteenth Century American Theaters." From the thousands of initially identified theaters, the forty that Dillon and Naylor selected as exemplary of nineteenth century theaters are the following.

The hypothesis draws on some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] sources such as the [[Khazar Correspondence]], according to which at some point in the 8th–9th centuries, the ruling elite of the Khazars was said by [[Judah Halevi]] and [[Abraham ibn Daud]] to have converted to [[Rabbinic Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of the [[Conversion to Judaism|conversion]] within the [[Khazar Khanate]] remains uncertain: the evidence used to tie the Ashkenazi communities to the Khazars is meager and subject to conflicting interpretations.&lt;ref name="Aderet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WayneState2013" /&gt;

This hypothesis has had a complex history within academia. While most contemporary scholars dismiss it, the hypothesis has often been argued in the past, and still finds occasional defenders of its plausibility. In the late 19th century, [[Ernest Renan]] and other scholars speculated that the Ashkenazi Jews of Europe [[ethnogenesis|originated]] among Turkic refugees who had migrated from the collapsed Khazarian Khanate westward into Europe, and [[language shift|exchanged]] their native [[Khazar language]] for [[Yiddish]] while continuing to practice [[Judaism]]. Though intermittently evoked by several scholars since that time, the Khazar-Ashkenazi hypothesis came to the attention of a much wider public with the publication of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[The Thirteenth Tribe]]'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="Sand 2010 240"&gt;{{harvnb|Sand|2010|p=240.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been revived recently by [[Eran Elhaik]], who in 2012 conducted a study aiming to vindicate it.&lt;ref name="rubin" /&gt;  Despite skepticism, he reformulated the concept in 2016 by developing a novel method of genetic analysis that uses the fringe [[linguistic]] theories of the Yiddish expert [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]].&lt;ref&gt;Batya Ungar-Sargon [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/176580/yiddishland 'The Mystery of the Origins of Yiddish Will Never Be Solved,'] [[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]] 23 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic studies on Jews]] have found no substantive evidence of a Khazar origin among Ashkenazi Jews, as opposed to evidence they have mixed [[Near East]]ern/Mediterranean and Southern European origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3032072 | pmid=20560205 | volume=86 | title=Abraham's children in the genome era: major Jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared Middle Eastern Ancestry | date=June 2010 | journal=Am.

The hypothesis has been used at times by [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionists]] to challenge the idea that Jews have ancestral ties to ancient Israel, and it has also played a role in [[anti-Semitic]] attitudes.

==History==

===1806–1918===
Some sources attribute to the Ukrainian Rabbi [[Isaac Baer Levinsohn]] (1788–1860) the first reference to a connection between the Ashkenazi Jews and the Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence J. Epstein]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=veJdBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 ''Converts to Judaism: Stories from Biblical Times to Today,''] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015 p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Levinsohn also recorded that the tradition of their forefathers was that Ashkenazi Jews had earlier spoken Russian before acquiring [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Spolsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xk9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 ''The Languages of the Jews;A Sociolinguistic History,''] Cambridge University Press 2014 p.297 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.it"&gt;[[Shlomo Sand]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgsP0DFkmp0C&amp;pg=PA243 ''The Invention of the Jewish People,''] Verso p.243.&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was advanced in 1808 by [[Gustav von Ewers|Johann Ewers]],&lt;ref&gt;''Vom Ursprung des Russischen Staats, ''. 1808&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of an early controversy over the foundations of the Russian state, which pitted scholars espousing a Norman origin for the [[Varangians]] against those who argued that these founders of the [[Kievan Rus']] were Slavic and indigenous. Ewers proposed the idea that the Viking/Varangian founders were in fact Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Vucinich, [https://books.google.com/books?id=czysAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA213 ''Science in Russian Culture: A History to 1860,'']'' Stanford University Press, vol.1 1963 p.213.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birgit Scholz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QPUrwrAABvEC&amp;pg=PA14 ''Von der Chronistik zur modernen Geschichtswissenschaft: die Warägerfrage in der russischen, deutschen und schwedischen Historiographie,''] Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2000 pp.13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vilhelm Thomsen|Vilhelm Ludvig Peter Thomsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6CMcqGmzuYC&amp;pg=PA16 ''The Relations Between Ancient Russia and Scandinavia, and the Origin of the Russian State: Three Lectures Delivered at the Taylor Institution. Oxford, in May, 1876,''] Cambridge University Press, reprint 2010 p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian historian  [[Nikolay Karamzin]] advanced the claim, asserting that considerable numbers of Khazars had left Khazaria for Kievan Rus' in the time of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir I]] (980–1015).&lt;ref name="Straten"&gt;Jits van Straten, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Sy4ZuWw8TgC&amp;pg=PA2 ''The Origin of  Ashkenazi Jewry:The Controversy Unravelled,''] Walter de Gruyter 2011 pp.2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The German Orientalist [[Karl Friedrich Neumann|Karl Neumann]] suggested as early as 1847 that the migration of Khazars might have contributed to the formation of the core population of the Jews of Eastern Europe, without however specifying whether he was referring to Judaizing Turks or ethnic Jewish residents of Khazaria.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Kizilov, [https://books.google.com/books?id=36t_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA388 'National Inventions:The Imperial Emancipation of the Karaites from Jewishness,'] in Roland Cvetkovski, Alexis Hofmeister (eds.),''An Empire of Others: Creating Ethnographic Knowledge in Imperial Russia and the USSR,'' Central European University Press, 2014 pp.369-393 p.399, citing [[Karl Friedrich Neumann|Karl Neumann]], [https://archive.org/details/dievlkerdessdli00neumgoog ''Die Völker des südlichen Russlands in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung,''] (1847) 2nd ed. Teubner 1855 pp.125-6:'Die Chasaren verschwinden nun als gebietende Horde aus der Geschichte, aber ihr Name hat sich, wie bekannt, in den Ländern und an den Meeren, wo sie ehemals herrschten, noch Jahrhunderte lang und zum Theil bis auf den heutigen Tag erhalten. Auch ist ja die Masse des Volkes von dem Jaik bis zur Donau immerdar dieselbe geblieben; es haben die Chasaren nur die Herrschaft verloren, welche auf andere Türken überging, auf Petschenegen, Usen und Komanen. Reste dieses Volkes, namentlich der zum Mosaismus sich bekennenden Abtheilung, sind die Karaim im südlichen Russland und den ehemaligen polnischen Ländern, welche türkisch sprechen  undauch in Körpergestalt und Gesichtszügen den Türken gleichen. Von der Krim aus mögen auch zuerst die Juden, welche, wie wir wissen, so zahlreich waren im Reiche der Chasaren, nach Russland und Polen gewandert sein.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, [[Abraham Harkavy|Abraham Eliyahu Harkavi]] suggested in 1869 that there might be a link between the Khazars and European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossman|2002|p=98}}: Abraham Harkavy, ''O iazike evreev, zhivshikh v drevnee vremia na Rusi i o slavianskikh slovakh, vstrechaiuschikhsia u evreiskikh pisatelei,'' St. Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, however, in 1872, a [[Crimean Karaite]], [[Abraham Firkovich]], alternatively proclaimed that the members of his Turkic-speaking sect were descended from Turkic converts to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nathans|1999|p=409}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis, that the descendents of Khazar converts to Judaism formed a major proportion of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], was first proposed to a Western public by [[Ernest Renan]] in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkun|1997|p=137}}: Ernest Renan, "Judaism as a Race and as Religion." Delivered on the January 27, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossman|2002|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a lecture delivered in Paris before the [[Saint-Simon Foundation|''Cercle du Saint-Simon'']] on 27 January 1883, Renan argued that conversion played a significant role in the formation of the Jewish people, stating that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This conversion of the kingdom of the Khazars has a considerable importance regarding the origin of those Jews who dwell in the countries along the Danube and southern Russia. These regions enclose great masses of Jewish populations which have in all probability nothing or almost nothing that is anthropologically Jewish in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renan|1883}}:Cette conversion du royaume des Khozars a une importance considérable dans la question de l’origine des juifs qui habitent les pays danubiens et le midi de la Russie. Ces régions renferment de grandes masses de populations juives qui n’ont probablement rien ou presque rien d’ethnographiquement juif.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renan's thesis found an echo soon after, in 1885, when [[Isidore Loeb]], a rabbi, historian and secretary of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]], in arguing for the cause of [[Jewish emancipation]], challenged the notion that nations were based on races, and the Jews therefore could be excluded as alien. To the contrary, he argued, they were no different from other  peoples and nations, all of which arose from miscegenation: the Jews were no exception, and one could assume, he added, that many German and Russian Jews descended from the Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore Loeb]] ‘Reflections on the Jews,’  in Mitchell Bryan Hart (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=556jcvWbwrcC&amp;pg=PA17 ''Jews and Race: Writings on Identity and Difference, 1880-1940,''] UPNE, 2011 pp.12-20  p.17. Cf. Isidore Loeb, ''Réflexions sur les Juifs,' [[Revue des Études Juives]], 27 (1893) pp.1-31). This was published posthumously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasional suggestions emerged that there was a small Khazar component in East European Jews in works by [[Joseph Jacobs]] (1886), [[Henri Jean Baptiste Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu|Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu]] (1893),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singerman|2004|pp=3–4}}, ''Israël chez les nations'' (1893):Eng.''Israel Among the Nations'' (1895).&lt;/ref&gt; Maksymilian Ernest Gumplowicz,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Polonsky|Basista|Link-Lenczowski|1993|p=120}}. In the book ''Początki religii żydowskiej w Polsce,'' Warsaw: E. Wende i S-ka, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Russian-Jewish anthropologist Samuel Weissenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|2006|p=131}}. Goldstein writes: ‘The theory that Eastern European Jews descended from the Khazars was originally proposed by . .Samuel Weissenberg in an attempt to show that Jews were deeply rooted on Russian soil and that the cradle of Jewish civilization was the Caucasus’. Weissenberg’s book ''Die Südrussischen Juden'', was published in 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leroy-Beaulieu, a critic of anti-Semitism who perhaps drew on Renan, queried whether or not thousands of [[Polish Jews|Polish]] and [[Russian Jews]] might have their origins traced back to the "old nomads of the steppes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singerman|1998|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 Hugo von Kutschera developed the notion into a book-length study,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koestler|1976|pp=134,150}}. ''Die Chasaren; historische Studie,'' A. Holzhauen, Vienna 1909. 2nd ed., 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Khazars formed the foundational core of the modern Ashkenazi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koestler|1976|pp=134,150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Fishberg]] introduced the notion to an [[United States|American]] audience in 1911 in his book, ''The Jews: A Study of Race and Environment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|2006|p=131}}. Maurice Fishberg, ''The Jews: A Study of Race and Environment.''&lt;/ref&gt;

When at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], a Jewish [[Zionist]] called [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] the land of the Jewish people's ancestors, [[Joseph Reinach]], a [[French Jews|French Jewish]] [[member of parliament]] who was opposed to Zionism, dismissed the idea, arguing that Jews descended from Israelites were a tiny minority. In his view, conversion had played a major role in the expansion of the Jewish people, and, in addition, he claimed, the majority of "Russian, Polish and [[Galician Jews]] descend from the Khazars, a Tatar people from the south of Russia who converted to Judaism in mass at the time of [[Charlemagne]]."&lt;ref&gt;John Quigley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GX8jX9dJXIAC&amp;pg=PA71 ''Palestine and Israel: A Challenge to Justice,''] Duke University Press, 1990 p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interwar years, 1918–1939===
The idea was also taken up by the Polish-Jewish economic historian and [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] Yitzhak Schipper in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Litman|1984|pp=85–110,109}}. Schipper’s first monograph on this was published in the ''Almanach Žydowski'' (Vienna) in 1918, While in the [[Warsaw ghetto]] before falling victim to the Holocaust at [[Majdanek]], Schipper (1884-1943) was working on the Khazar hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook|2009|p=210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by scholarly anthropologists, such as [[Roland Burrage Dixon|Roland B. Dixon]] (1923), and by writers like [[H. G. Wells]] (1921) who used it to argue that "The main part of Jewry never was in Judea",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|2004|p=2}}:"There were Arab tribes who were Jews in the time of Muhammad, and a Turkic people who were mainly Jews in South Russia in the ninth century. Judaism is indeed the reconstructed political ideal of many shattered peoples-mainly semitic. As a result of these coalescences and assimilations, almost everywhere in the towns throughout the Roman Empire, and far beyond it in the east, Jewish communities traded and flourished, and were kept in touch through the Bible, and through a religious and educational organization. The main part of Jewry never was in Judea and had never come out of Judea."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singerman|2004|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a thesis that was to have a political echo in later opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2003|p=22}}: [[John Bagot Glubb|Pasha Glubb]] held that Russian Jews ‘have considerably less Middle Eastern blood, consisting largely of pagan Slav proselytes or of Khazar Turks.’ For Glubb, they were not 'descendants of the Judeans . .The Arabs of Palestine are probably more closely related to the Judeans (genetically) than are modern Russian or German Jews'. . 'Of course, an anti-Zionist (as well as an anti-Semitic) point is being made here: The Palestinians have a greater political right to Palestine than the Jews do, as they, not the modern-day Jews, are the true descendants of the land's Jewish inhabitants/owners'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland Burrage Dixon ''The Racial History of Man,'' 1923; [[H. G. Wells]], [[The Outline of History]] (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote to [[Max Eitingon]] that the sculptor [[Oscar Nemon]], for whom he was sitting, showed the lineaments of a "Slavic Eastern Jew, Khazar or [[Kalmuck]] or something like that".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilman|1995|p=30|}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, [[Samuel Krauss]] ventured the theory that the biblical [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenaz]] referred to northern [[Asia Minor]], and he identified it with the Khazars, a position immediately disputed by Jacob Mann.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Malkiel|2008|p=263,n.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interwar period consolidated also a belief, originally developed by the Russian Orientalists V.V. Grigor’iev and V.D. Smirnov, that the East European congregations of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite sect]] of Judaism were descendants of Turkic Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Kizilov, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i6SlCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA450 ''The Sons of Scripture: The Karaites in Poland and Lithuania in the Twentieth Century,''] Walter de Gruyter 2015 pp.109ff., p.450.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a Khazarian origin of the Karaites was then adopted as their official viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Dov Walfish  (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7M0_Ba0lDjwC&amp;pg=PA146 ''Библиография Караитика: Аннотированная Библиография Караимов И Караимизма,''] BRILL, 2011 p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seraya Shapshal|Seraja Szapszal]] (1873–1961), from 1927, the [[Hakham|ḥakham]] of the Polish-Lithuanian Karaite community had begun to implement a thorough-going reform policy of dejudaizing Karaite culture and traditions and transforming along Turkic lines. As a secular Jew and orientalist he was influenced by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk's reforms]], and his policy was dictated by several considerations: Jews were suffering from harassment in public and private in Eastern Europe; he wished to forestall the threat he had intuited was imminent in both Fascism and Nazism, which were beginning to gain a foothold; he was passionate about the Karaites' language, [[Karaim language|Karaim]], and its Turkish tradition, and somewhat insouciant of the Judaic heritage of his people.  In 1934 [[Corrado Gini]], a distinguished  statistician, interested also in demography and anthropology, with close ties to the fascist elite, led an expedition in August–October 1934 to survey the  [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]. He concluded that Karaites were  ethnically mixed, predominantly [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] which he mistook to be [[Finno-Ugric]] descendants of the [[Cimmerians|Tauro-Cimmerians]] who at one point had been absorbed into the Khazars who for Gini however were not Turkic. A further conclusion was that the Ashkenazi arose from ‘Turko-Tatar converts to Judaism.’&lt;ref name="Kizilov"&gt;Mikhail Kizilov,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=hGILHIgEl7cC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281 ''The Karaites of Galicia: An Ethnoreligious Minority Among the Ashkenazim, the Turks, and the Slavs, 1772-1945,''] BRILL, 2009 pp.266,269-271,277ff.282, 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riccardo Calimani, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kMb_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT583 ''Storia degli ebrei italiani,''] vol.3, Mondadori 2015 p.583.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Khazar-Karaite theory is unsubstantiated by any historical evidence, - the early Karaite literature speaks of Khazars as [[mamzer]]im, 'bastards' or 'strangers' within Judaism - this  myth served a political purpose, of taking that community out of the stranglehold of anti-Semitic regulations and prejudices directed generally against Jews in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Kizilov" /&gt;

===1939–1945===
In 1943, [[Abraham Polak|Abraham N. Polak]] (sometimes referred to as ''Poliak''), later professor of the history of the Middle Ages at [[Tel Aviv University]], published a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[monograph]] in which he concluded that the East European Jews came from Khazaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=29}}. 'Poliak sought the origins of Eastern European Jewry in Khazaria'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sand |2010|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First written as an article in 1941, then as a monograph (1943), it was twice revised in 1944, and 1951 as ''Kazariyah: Toldot mamlacha yehudit be'Eropa'' (Khazaria: History of a Jewish Kingdom in Europe) Mosad Bialik, Tel Aviv, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nazi Germany, unlike most race theorists in Germany down to his time [[Hans F. K. Günther]] argued that the Jews were not a pure race, although he nevertheless considered them to be highly inbred.  He argued that the Ashkenazi were a mix of Near Eastern, Oriental, East Baltic, Eastern, Inner-Asian, Nordic, Hamite, and Negro peoples and separate from the Sephardim. Günther believed that the conversion of the Khazars, whom he took to have been a Near Eastern race  constituted a further external element in the  racial makeup of the Ashkenazi Jews, strengthening its Near Eastern component.&lt;ref name="Steinweis"&gt;{{cite book | title = Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany | author = Alan E.

===1946–1949===
In debates leading up to the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN plan in 1947 to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states]], the British politicians [[John Hope Simpson]] and [[Edward Spears]], intent on denying Zionism that part of its claim that drew on biblical arguments, asserted that Jewish immigrants to [[Mandatory Palestine]] were the descendants of pagan converts and not of the Israelites. The approach was one shared by both gentile and Jewish anti-Zionists. Rory Miller claims that their denial of a lineal descent from Israelites drew on the Khazar theory.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book | title = Divided Against Zion: Anti-Zionist Opposition to the Creation of a Jewish State in Palestine, 1945-1948 |author = Rory Miller| publisher = Routledge| year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 128}}

In anti-Zionist argumentation delivered at the UN during 1947 [[Faris al-Khoury]] and [[Jamal Al-Husseini]] used the theory to oppose the creation of a Jewish state on racial and historic grounds. [[Albert Hourani|Cecil Hourani]] claimed that the Arab leaders had been convinced of the value of the argument by [[Benjamin H. Freedman]]. Internal British documents seem to support the claim.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;{{rp| 129}} It would later play a role in [[Arab]] [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] polemics, taking on an antisemitic edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harkabi|1987|p=424}}:"Arab anti-Semitism might have been expected to be free from the idea of racial odium, since Jews and Arabs are both regarded by race theory as Semites, but the odium is directed, not against the Semitic race, but against the Jews as a historical group. The main idea is that the Jews, racially, are a mongrel community, most of them being not Semites, but of Khazar and European origin." This essay was translated from Harkabi Hebrew text 'Arab Antisemitism' in Shmuel Ettinger, ''Continuity and Discontinuity in Antisemitism,'' (Hebrew) 1968 (p.50).&lt;/ref&gt; though Bernard Lewis, noted in 1987 that serious Arab scholars had dropped it, remarked that it only occasionally emerged in Arab political polemics.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zjkiAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Semites+and+Anti-Semites:+An+Inquiry+into+Conflict+and+Prejudice&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihpsykvO_MAhUGWh4KHTvFDnMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=khazars&amp;f=false | title = Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry Into Conflict and Prejudice | author= Bernard Lewis | publisher = W.

===1950–1976===
[[D.M. Dunlop]], writing in 1954, thought very little evidence backed what he regarded as a mere assumption, and argued that the Ashkenazi-Khazar descent hypothesis went far beyond what "our imperfect records" permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1954|pp=261,263}}:'.'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]], while assuming the Jews of Western Europe resulted from a "panmixia" in the first millennium, asserted in 1955 that it was widely assumed that Europe's Eastern Jews descended from a mixture of Khazarian and [[German Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Poliakov|2005|p=285}}:'As for the Jews of Eastern Europe (Poles, Russians, etc.,) it has always been assumed that they descended from an amalgamation of Jews of Khazar stock from southern Russia and German Jews (the latter having imposed their superior culture).'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Polak|Polak]]'s work found some support from [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]] and [[Ben-Zion Dinur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sand|2010|pp=241–2}}. Sand cites [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]],{{harvnb|Baron|1957|pp=196–206, p.206}}:'before and after the Mongol upheaval the Khazars sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish center of Eastern Europe'; and [[Ben-Zion Dinur]], ''Yisrael ba-gola'' 5 vols., 3rd ed. (1961-1966) Tel-Aviv: Jerusalem:Dvir;Bialik Institute, 1961. (OCLC:492532282) vol.1 p.2,5:'The Russian conquests did not destroy the Khazar kingdom entirely, but they broke it up and diminished it And this kingdom, which had absorbed Jewish immigration and refugees from many exiles, must itself have become a diaspora mother, the mother of one of the greatest of the diasporas (''Em-galuyot, em akhat hagaluyot hagdolot'')-of Israel in Russia, Lithuania and Poland.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=55}}:’Salo Baron, who incorrectly viewed them as Finno-Ugrians, believed that the Khazars "sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish centers of eastern Europe’&lt;/ref&gt; but was dismissed by Bernard Weinryb as a fiction (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=55}}:’dismissed. . .rather airily’.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]], called by his biographer an "architect of Jewish history",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liberles|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; devoted a large part of a chapter in his ''Social and Religious History of the Jews'' to the Khazarian Jewish state, and the impact he believed that community exercised on the formation of East European Jewries in his ''Social and Religious History of the Jews'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|pp=196–222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The scarcity of direct Jewish testimonies did not disconcert Baron: this was to be expected since medieval Jews were "generally inarticulate outside their main centers of learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Khazarian turn to Judaism was, he judged, the "largest and last mass conversion", involving both the royal house and large sectors of the population. Jews migrated there to flee the recurrent intolerance against Jews and the geopolitical upheavals of the region's chronic wars, which often proved devastating to northern [[Asia Minor]], between [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], and the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Ummayad Caliphate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|p=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Baron, the fact of Jewish Khazaria played a lively role in stirring up among Western Jews an image of "[[red Jews]]", and among Jews in [[Islamic countries]] a beacon of hope. After the dissolution of Khazaria, Baron sees a diaspora drifting both north into Russia, Poland and the [[Ukraine]], and westwards into [[Pannonia]] and the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|pp=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; where their cultivated presence both established Jewish communities and paved the way, ironically, for the Slavonic conversion to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baron|1957|pp=208–210,221}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 11th and 12th centuries, these Eastern Jews make their first appearance in the Jewish literature of France and Germany. [[Maimonides]], bemoaning the neglect of learning in the East, laid his hopes for the perpetuation of Jewish learning in the young struggling communities of Europe but would, Baron concludes, have been surprised to find that within centuries precisely in Eastern Europe would arise thriving communities that were to assume leadership of the Jewish people itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bacon|1957|pp=173,222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koestler, ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' and contemporary views===
The Khazar-Ashkenazi hypothesis came to the attention of a much wider public with the publication of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[The Thirteenth Tribe]]'', which made sweeping claims for a Khazar legacy among the Ashkenazi in 1976.&lt;ref name="Sand 2010 240" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=9"&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koestler's work was both positively and negatively reviewed. Israel’s ambassador to Britain branded the book "an anti-Semitic action financed by the Palestinians", while [[Bernard Lewis]] claimed that the idea was not supported by any evidence whatsoever, and had been "abandoned by all serious scholars".&lt;ref name="Sand 2010 240" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1987|p=48}}:'Some limit this denial to European Jews and make use of the theory that the Jews of Europe are not of Israelite descent at all but are the offspring of a tribe of Central Asian Turks converted to Judaism, called the Khazars. This theory, first put forward by an Austrian anthropologist in the early years of this century, is supported by no evidence whatsoever. It has long since been abandoned by all serious scholars in the field, including those in Arab countries, where Khazar theory is little used except in occasional political polemics.' Assertions of this kind has been challenged by Paul Wexler{{harvnb|Wexler|2002|pp=538}} who also notes that the arguments on this issue are riven by contrasting ideological investments: "Most writers who have supported the Ashkenazi-Khazar hypothesis have not argued their claims in a convincing manner ... The opponents of the Khazar-Ashkenazi nexus are no less guilty of empty polemics and unconvincing arguments."(p.537).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphael Patai]], however, registered some support for the idea that Khazar remnants had played a role in the growth of Eastern European Jewish communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Patai|Patai|1989|p=71}}: "it is assumed by all historians that those Jewish Khazars who survived the last fateful decades sought and found refuge in the bosom of Jewish communities in the Christian countries to the west, and especially in Russia and Poland, on the one hand, and in the Muslim countries to the east and the south, on the other. Some historians and anthropologists go so far as to consider the modern Jews of East Europe, and more particularly of Poland, the descendants of the medieval Khazars."&lt;/ref&gt; and several amateur researchers, such as Boris Altschüler (1994)&lt;ref name="harvnb|Golden|2007a|p=9" /&gt; and Kevin Alan Brook, kept the thesis in the public eye. Brook's views evolved as new data became available: in the first edition of his book (1999), he contended that about one-fourth of Ashkenazic ancestry may trace back to the Khazars,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook|1999|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the second edition (2006) he regarded the Khazar contribution as "small"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook|2009|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the third edition (2018) he argued against any Khazar contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brook|2018|pp=207-208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koestler argued that this theory would mitigate European racially based antisemitism.&lt;ref name="Scammell"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bO7ANkFkH0UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Literary+and+Political+Odyssey+of+a+Twentieth-Century+Skeptic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1uxPVbmgHpKYyATKhYDIBA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Khazars%20&amp;f=false | title = Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic| author= Michael Scammell | publisher = Random House Publishing Group | year = 2009| page = 546}}: "Every prayer and ritual observance proclaims membership of an ancient race, which automatically separates the Jew from the racial and historic past of the people in whose midst he lives. It sets the Jew apart and invites his being set apart. It automatically creates physical and cultural ghettoes."&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has been used to counter the concept of Jewish nationhood.&lt;ref name="Sand 2010 240" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toch|2012|p=155,n.4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been revived recently in a variety of approaches, from linguistics ([[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wexler|2007|pp=387–398}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to historiography ([[Shlomo Sand]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sand|2010|pp=190–249}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[population genetics]] (Eran Elhaik).&lt;ref name="Elhaik 2012 61–74"&gt;{{harvnb|Elhaik|2012|pp=61–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In broad academic perspective, both the idea that the Khazars converted ''en masse'' to Judaism, and the suggestion that they emigrated to form the core population of Ashkenazi Jewry, remain highly polemical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2007 |pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics and the Khazar theory==
{{See also|Genetic studies on Jews}}
Before modern DNA population genetics entered the field, [[Raphael Patai]] described the Khazars in racial terms as being a Turkic people with some [[Mongoloid]] admixture.&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Myth of the Jewish Race |authors= Raphael Patai, Jennifer Patai |publisher= Wayne State University Press |year= 1989 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; After major advances in DNA [[sequence analysis]] and computing technology in the late 20th and early 21st century, a plethora of [[genetic research]] on Jewish and other human populations has been conducted worldwide. The Yiddish scholar [[Alexander Beider]] regards genetic studies as often offering contradictory information, further complicated by the fact that some researchers' work is influenced by personal views.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Beider]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zWK8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA553 ''Origins of Yiddish Dialects,''] Oxford University Press, 2015 p.553:’Unfortunately, genetic studies on Ashkenazi Jews, numerous since the 1990s, often provide contradictory information. Related methodological issues are huge: no access to the genetic pool of populations who lived centuries before us, the possibility of the genetic variation related to national selection, etc. To these objective problems one should add striking subjective elements: for certain authors, the way they proceed in their investigation and their interpretation of obtained results are clearly skewed by their political and/or religious feelings.'&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Martin B. Richards, presently available genetic studies, including his own study on Ashkenazi maternal lineages, all refute the Khazar theory.&lt;ref name="jewishvoiceny-ashkenazi" /&gt; The claim that Ashkenazis as a whole take their origin from Khazars has been widely criticized as there is no direct evidence to support it.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom"&gt;Melissa Hogenboom, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24442352 'European link to Jewish maternal ancestry] [[BBC News]], 9 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=No indication of Khazar genetic ancestry among Ashkenazi Jews |url= http://www.ashg.org/2013meeting/abstracts/fulltext/f130123130.htm |publisher=[[American Society of Human Genetics|ASHG]] |accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using four Jewish groups, one being Ashkenazi, Kopelman ''et al'' found no evidence for the Khazar theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kopelman |first1=NM |last2=Stone |first2=L |last3=Wang |first3=C |title=Genomic microsatellites identify shared Jewish ancestry intermediate between Middle Eastern and European populations |journal=BMC Genetics |volume=10 |page=80 |year=2009 |pmid=19995433 |pmc=2797531 |doi=10.1186/1471-2156-10-80|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Nebel et al., summarizing studies that reported a low-level European gene flow contributing to Ashkenazi paternal gene pool, suggested this influence might be reflected in the Eu 19 chromosomes common in Eastern Europe, or otherwise, that Ashkenazim with this component might descend from Khazars, an hypothesis the authors found "attractive".&lt;ref&gt;Almut Nebel, Dvora Filon, Bernd Brinkmann, Partha P.

In 2003 Behar, remarking on the high frequency haplogroup R1a1 NRYs in that former Khazar sphere of influence and noting [[Paul Wexler (linguist)|Paul Wexler]]'s theory of relexification, raised the possibility that the Khazar  theory might offer an attractive source for an important eastern component of the Ashkenazim.&lt;ref name="Behar2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Behar DM, Thomas MG, Skorecki K, etal |title=Multiple origins of Ashkenazi Levites: Y chromosome evidence for both Near Eastern and European ancestries |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=768–779 |date=October 2003 |pmid=13680527 |pmc=1180600 |doi=10.1086/378506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein2008"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goldstein |first=David B. |title=Jacob's legacy: A genetic view of Jewish history |publisher= Yale University Press |year=2008 |pages=location 873 (Kindle for PC) |chapter=3 |isbn=978-0-300-12583-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 [[David B.

A 2013 study by Rootsi, Behar et al. of Ashkenazi Levites (4% of the Jewish male line) found a high frequency of haplogroup R1a-M582 among them (64.9% of Ashkenazi Levites) pointing to a founding event and paternal ancestor common to half of them. Since R1a shows high frequency in Eastern Europe generally, it was thought possible, that the evidence might indicate  the founder was a non-Jewish European. Testing the 3 hypotheses of a European, a Near Eastern or a Khazarian origin, their data excluded both the European and Khazarian origin of a Levite founder  since they found no evidence of R1a-M582 Y-chromosomes was found in either group, other than singletons, while it occurs with significant frequency in Near Eastern  regions [[Kerman|Iranian Kerman]], [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azeri]], the Kurds from Cilician Anatolia and Kazakhstan, and among Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews. R1a-M582  was not detected among data from Iraqi, Bedouins, Druze and Palestinians sampled in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Rootsi, Behar et al., [http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3928 'Phylogenetic applications of whole Y-chromosome sequences and the Near Eastern origin of Ashkenazi Levites,'] Natures Communications  17 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elhaik study===
Eran Elhaik has argued, in two separate papers, the first in 2012 and the latest (2016) co-authored by Wexler, that his genetic analysis strengthens the Khazar hypothesis. Of the 2012 study Elhaik wrote: 

:"Strong evidence for the Khazarian hypothesis is the clustering of European Jews with the populations that in his opinion resided on opposite ends of ancient Khazaria: Armenians, Georgians, and [[Azerbaijani Jews]]. Because Caucasus populations remained relatively isolated in the Caucasus region and because there are no records of Caucasus populations mass-migrating to Eastern and Central Europe prior to the fall of Khazaria (Balanovsky et al. 2011), these findings imply a shared origin for European Jews and Caucasus populations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/61.full]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 study Wexler, Elhaik, et al. argued that the first Ashkenazi populations to speak the Yiddish language came from areas near four villages in Eastern Turkey along the Silk Road whose names derived from the word "Ashkenaz," rather than from Germanic lands as is the general consensus in scholarship. Elhaik and Wexler proposed a variant for the canonical Khazarian hypothesis, proposing that Iranians, Greeks, Turks, and Slavs converted to Judaism in Anatolia prior to migrating to Khazaria where a small-scale conversion had already occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-04/20/yiddish-origin-turkey-dna-analysis|last=Burgess|first=Matt|date=20 April 2016|title=Yiddish may have originated in Turkey, not Germany|website=Wired.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=R.|last2=Wexler|first2=P.|last3=Pirooznia|first3=M.|last4=Elhaik|first4=E.|year=2016|title=Localizing Ashkenazic Jews to primeval villages in the ancient Iranian lands of Ashkenaz|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|volume=8|issue=4|pages=1132–1149|url=http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/4/1132.full|doi=10.1093/gbe/evw046|pmid=26941229|pmc=4860683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Bernard Spolsky commenting on Elhaik’s earlier study wrote. “Recently, Elhaik (2013) claims to have found evidence supporting the Khazarian origin of Ashkenazim, but the whole issue of genetic evidence remains uncertain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spolsky|2014|p=297 n.12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stampfer study===
In June 2014, [[Shaul Stampfer]] published a paper challenging the Khazar hypothesis as ungrounded in sources contemporary with the Khazar period, stating: "Such a conversion, even though it’s a wonderful story, never happened".&lt;ref name="Aderet"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aderet|first1=Ofer|title=Jews are not descended from Khazars, Hebrew University historian says|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/1.601287|accessdate=1 October 2014|work=Haaretz|date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaul Stampfer]], [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jewish_social_studies/v019/19.3.stampfer.pdf "Did the Khazars Convert to Judaism?,"] Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society 19 (3) pp.1–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the Elhaik study===
Elhaik's 2012 study proved highly controversial. Several noted geneticists, among them [[Marcus Feldman]], [[Harry Ostrer]] and [[Michael Hammer (geneticist)|Michael Hammer]] have maintained - and the view has gained widespread support among scientists - that the worldwide Jewish population is homogeneous and shares common roots in the [[Middle East]], Feldman stated Elhaik's statistical analysis would not pass muster with most scientists; Hammer affirmed it was an outlier minority view without scientific support. Elhaik in reply described the group as ‘liars’ and ‘frauds’, noting Ostrer would not share genetic data that might be used ‘to defame the Jewish people’. Elhaik’s PhD supervisor [[Dan Graur]], likewise dismissed them as  a ‘clique’, and said Elhaik is ‘combative’ which is what science itself is.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Rubin, [http://forward.com/news/israel/175912/jews-a-race-genetic-theory-comes-under-fierce-atta/?p=all ‘Jews a Race’ Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert,'] [[The Forward]] 7 May  2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

Elhaik's 2012 study was specifically criticized for its use of Armenians and Azerbaijani Jews as proxies for Khazars and for using [[Bedouin]] and [[Jordan]]ian [[Hashemites]] as a proxy for the Ancient Israelites. The former decision was criticized because Armenians were assumed to have a monolithic Caucasian ancestry, when as an [[Anatolian people]] (rather than Turkic) they contain many genetically Middle Eastern elements. Azerbaijani Jews are also assumed for the purposes of the study to have Khazarian ancestry, when [[Mountain Jews]] are actually descended from [[Persian Jews]]. The decision to cast Bedouin/Hashemites as "proto-Jews" was especially seen as political in nature, considering that both have origins in [[Arab tribes]] from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] rather than from the Ancient Israelites, while the descent of the Jews from the Israelites is largely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Terra-Incognita-The-return-of-the-Khazar-myth Terra Incognita: Return of the Khazar Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&amp;context=humbiol_preprints No Evidence of Genome Wide Khazar Origin of Modern Jews]&lt;/ref&gt; The study was also criticized as interpreting information selectively—The study found far more genetic similarity between the [[Druze]] and Ashkenazim than the Ashkenazim and Armenians, but Elhaik rejected this as indicating a common Semitic origin, instead interpreting it as evidence of Druze having Turkic origins when they are known to come from Syria.

Geneticists conducting studies in Jewish genetics have challenged Elhaik's methods in his first paper. Michael Hammer called Elhaik's premise "unrealistic," calling Elhaik and other Khazarian hypothesis proponents "outlier folks… who have a minority view that’s not supported scientifically. I think the arguments they make are pretty weak and stretching what we know." [[Marcus Feldman]], director of [[Stanford University]]'s Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies, echoes Hammer. "If you take all of the careful genetic population analysis that has been done over the last 15 years… there’s no doubt about the common Middle Eastern origin," he said. He added that Elhaik’s first paper "is sort of a one-off." Elhaik’s statistical analysis would not pass muster with most contemporary scholars, Feldman said: "He appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data." &lt;ref name="rubin"&gt;Rita Rubin, [http://forward.com/news/israel/175912/jews-a-race-genetic-theory-comes-under-fierce-atta/?p=all 'Jews a Race' Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert,']. ''[[The Forward]]'', 7 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elhaik and Wexler's 2016 study was challenged by two prominent scholars of Jewish demography from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Shaul Stampfer, a professor of Soviet and East European Jewry, deemed it “basically nonsense.” Sergio DellaPergola, the primary demographer of the Jewish people at the university, called it a "falsification", criticizing its methodology, using a small population size and selectively removing population groups that refuted the findings they wanted, namely other Jewish groups such as the [[Italkim]] and [[Sephardic Jews]], to whom Ashkenazi Jews are closely related genetically. “Serious research would have factored in the glaring genetic similarity between Sephardim and Ashkenazim, which mean Polish Jews are more genetically similar to Iraqi Jews than to a non-Jewish Pole.”&lt;ref name="jta" /&gt; Elhaik replied that “studying the DNA of non-Ashkenazic Jews would not change the DNA of Ashkenazic Jews nor the predicted origin of their DNA.'.&lt;ref name="jta"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/prominent-scholars-blast-theory-tracing-ashkenazi-jews-to-turkey/ Prominent scholars blast theory tracing Ashkenazi Jews to Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a study by a team of biologists and linguists, led by Pavel Flegontov, a specialist in genomics, published a response to Das, Elhaik and Wexler's 2016 study, criticizing their methodology and conclusions. They argue that GPS allows inferences works for the origins of modern populations with an unadmixed genome, but not for tracing ancestries back 1,000 years ago. In their view, the paper tried to fit Wexler's  'marginal and unsupported interpretation' of Yiddish into a model that only permits valid deductions for recent unadmixed populations.

==Antisemitism==
{{Antisemitism}}
===United Kingdom and United States===
Maurice Fishberg and Roland B. Dixon's works were later exploited in racist and religious polemical literature, by advocates of [[British Israelism]], in both [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|2006|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly after the publication of [[Burton J. Hendrick]] ‘s ''The Jews in America'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singerman|2004|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it began to enjoy a vogue among advocates of immigration restrictions in the 1920s; racial theorists&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkun|2012|p=165}}:'Although the Khazar theory gets surprisingly little attention in scholarly histories of anti-Semitism, it has been an influential theme among American anti-Semites since the immigration restrictionists of the 1920s,'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|2002|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Lothrop Stoddard]]; antisemitic [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] like the [[Ku Klux Klan]]’s [[Hiram Wesley Evans]]; and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] polemicists like John O. Beaty&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boller |1992|pp=2,6–7}}; {{harvnb|Barkun |1997|pp=141–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Ezra Pound]], then strongly identifying with the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime of [[Benito Mussolini]], sent a query to fellow poet [[Louis Zukofsky]] concerning the Khazars after someone had written to him claiming that the ancient Jews had died out and that modern Jews were of Khazar descent. He returned to the issue in 1955, apparently influenced by a book called ''Facts are Facts'', which pushed the Jewish-Khazar descent theory, and which for Pound had dug up "a few savoury morsels".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pound|Zukovsky|1987|p=xxi}}, citing letterd of 10 July 1938 and 24/25 September 1955. Ahearn speculates that Pound may have thought:'If there were no such people as Jews, then the problem of indiscriminate anti-Semitism would disappear. On could focus one’s attention on usurers of whatever description.'&lt;/ref&gt; The booklet in question, by a [[Roman Catholic]] convert from [[Rabbinic Judaism]] [[Benjamin H. Freedman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an anti-Semitic tirade written to [[David Goldstein (Catholic apologist)|David Goldstein]] after the latter had converted to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaplan|1997|p=191 n.3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

John O. Beaty was an antisemitic, [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] professor of [[Old English]] at [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]], author of ''The Iron Curtain over America'' (Dallas 1952). According to him, "the Khazar Jews were responsible for all of America's – and the world's ills," beginning with [[World War I]]. The book had little impact until the former Wall Street broker and oil tycoon J. Russell Maguire promoted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boller|2013|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was adopted by Wilmot Robertson, whose views influenced [[David Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkun|1997|pp=140–141}}. His ''Dispossessed Majority'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; The British author [[Douglas Reed]] has also been influential. In his work the Ashkenazi are false Jews, descendants of the Khazars.&lt;ref name ="Papers"/&gt;{{rp| 355}}

A number of different variants of the theory came to be exploited by the [[Christian Identity]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkun |1997|pp=140–144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian Identity movement, which took shape from the 1940s to the 1970s, had its roots in British Israelism which had been planted on American evangelical soil in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2002|p=165}}.'The formative period of Christian Identity could roughly be said to be the three decades between 1940 and 1970. Through missionaries like [[Wesley A. Swift|Wesley Swift]], Bertrand Comparet and William Potter Gale, it took on a white [[Racialism|racialist]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Conservatism|conservative]] political outlook. Combined with the teachings of early disciples [[Richard Girnt Butler|Richard G. Butler]], Colonel Jack Mohr and James K. Warner, a distinctly [[Racism|racist]] [[theology]] was gradually formed. [[White people|Whites]] were said to be the Adamic people, created in His likeness. A notion of a pre-earthly existence is found in an important substratum, teaching that whites either had a spiritual or extraterrestrial pre-existence. Blacks were either [[Pre-Adamite|pre-Adamic]] soulless creatures or represented fallen, evil spirits, but they were not the chief target of fear and hatred. This position was reserved for Jews. The latent anti-Semitism found in British-Israelism rose to prominence. Jews were, at best, reduced to mongrelized imposters, not infrequently identified with Eurasian Khazars without any legitimate claim to a closeness with [[God]], and at worst denounced as the offspring of [[Satan]].'&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s the Khazar ancestry theory was an article of faith in the Christian Identity movement.&lt;ref name ="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaiaM77s6N4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Black-Sun-Esoteric-Politics-Identity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlsuv1ge3MAhWJMj4KHTwZDUEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=khazars%20&amp;f=false| title = Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity |author= [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]|publisher = NYU Press| page = 237| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Identity]] movement has associated two verses from the [[New Testament]], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2%3A9&amp;version=KJV Revelation 2:9] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A9&amp;version=KJV 3:9] with the Khazars. [[Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] calls these two passages the corner stone of Identity theology. He also reports that Christian Identity literature makes selective references to the [[Babylonian Talmud]], while the works of Francis Parker Yockey and Arthur Koestler work are raised almost to the status of Holy Writ.&lt;ref name =" Kaplan "&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qIilYBbxSbcC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=khazars+revelation+2:9&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR2OufwdXMAhVHOCYKHZfmA1U4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=identty&amp;f=false | title = Radical Religion in America: Millenarian Movements from the Far Right to the Children of Noah | author= Jeffrey Kaplan | publisher = Syracuse University Press | year = 1997 | pages = 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union and Russia===
The theory was prominent in Soviet antisemitism, gaining a place in Soviet historiography. The theory influenced Soviet historians including [[Boris Rybakov]], [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]] and [[Lev Gumilyov]] and was used to support soviet political theory.&lt;ref name ="Zhivkov"/&gt;{{rp| Vii-Viii }} Artamonov argued that the Khazars had played an important role in the development of Rus’. A view that Rybakov disputed instead regarding the Khazar state as parasitic.&lt;ref name ="klejn"&gt;{{cite book | title = Soviet Archaeology: Trends, Schools, and History | author= Leo S. Klejn | publisher = OUP Oxford| year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 260–261}} Official Soviet views on the Khazars hardened after December 1951 when [[Pravda]] published a critical review of Artamonov's work under the pen name P. Ivanov.&lt;ref name ="Tillett"&gt;{{cite book | title = The great friendship: Soviet historians on the non-Russian nationalities| author= Lowell Tillett| publisher = University of North Carolina Press | year = 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 313–314}} Rybakov for his part denied that he was Ivanov.&lt;ref name ="klejn"/&gt;{{rp| 261}} It has been speculated that Ivanov was in fact Stalin. In Ivanov’s review the Khazars were regarded as parasites and enemies.&lt;ref name ="sand"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Invention of the Jewish People| author= Shlomo Sand | publisher = Verso| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 237 }} Ivanov’s views became the certified Soviet position.&lt;ref name ="Tillett"/&gt;{{rp| 314}}

Lev Gumilyov’s theory of ethnogenesis draws heavily on the Khazars theory.

Since the 1970s the term Khazars has entered the Russian nationalist lexicon, it is used as a euphemism for Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shnirelman|2007|p=369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vadim V.

===Cults===
[[Aum Shinrikyo]] is a Japanese [[doomsday cult]]. The cult was active in Japan and Russia, with an estimated 10,000 and 30,000 followers respectively.&lt;ref name ="Knox"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jrWrbJAIyHQC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=aum+shinrikyo+russia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhxP2yzd3MAhWD7SYKHclQAYwQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aum%20shinrikyo%20russia&amp;f=false| title = Russian Society and the Orthodox Church: Religion in Russia After Communism | author= Zoe Knox|publisher = Routledge| year = 2004| page = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups “Manual of Fear” used the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in addition to other anti-Semitic material. The manual claimed that the Jews are really Khazars intent on world domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|Miyazawi |2000|pp=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Dikötter"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys5oy66VjisC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=Aum+khazar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLg7eCzt3MAhVKSyYKHdC_AYcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Aum%20khazar&amp;f=false| title = The Construction of Racial Identities in China and Japan: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives|editor= Frank Dikötter|publisher = University of Hawaii Press| year = 1997| page = 196}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Khazar theory has also become part of the [[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Masters]] theology. [[Master Jesus#Hatonn and the photon belt|Hatonn]], an extraterrestrial, transmits messages including the complete text of [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]. He identifies the authors of The Protocols as Khazars and speaks of false Zionist Jews who have usurped and controlled the true Jews.&lt;ref name ="Katz"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AQcUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=khazars+anti+semitism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSy7bgrN3MAhWHlR4KHV4iD7w4ChDoAQgsMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=khazars%20anti%20semitism&amp;f=false| title = The Paranoid Apocalypse: A Hundred-Year Retrospective on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion | editor = Richard Landes |editor2=Steven T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64448">This article lists the oldest free-standing buildings constructed in the world, including on each of the continents and within each country.
"[[Building]]" is defined as any human-made structure used or interface  for supporting or sheltering any use or continuous [[occupancy]]. In order to qualify for list a structure must:
* be a recognisable building;
* incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least 1.5 metres (4.9&amp;nbsp;ft) in height;
* be largely complete or include building work to this height for most of its perimeter.
* contains an enclosed area with at least one entry point.
This consciously excludes ruins of limited height and statues. The list also excludes:
* [[dolmen]]s&amp;mdash;a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb, usually consisting of three or more upright stones supporting a large flat horizontal capstone. Dolmens were typically covered with earth or smaller stones to form a [[tumulus]] (which are included in the list). In many instances, that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone "skeleton" of the burial mound intact. [[Neolithic]] dolmens are extremely numerous, with over 1,000 reported from [[Megaliths in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in Germany alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/holtorf/1.1.html "Megaliths in Mecklenburg–Vorpommern"]. University of Toronto. Retrieved 17 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[cairn]]s which are simply large piles of loose stones (as opposed to [[chambered cairn]]s.)

Dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by [[radiocarbon dating]] and should be considered approximate.

==By age==
The following are amongst the oldest buildings in the world that have maintained the requirements to be such.  Occupation sites with older human made structures such as those in [[Göbekli Tepe]] do exist, but the structures are monuments and do not meet the definition of building (which can be seen above).  Many of the buildings within the list contain primarily bricks, but most importantly maintain their walls and roof. There are numerous extant structures that survive in the [[Orkney]] islands of Scotland, some of the best known of which are part of the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/514/ "Heart of Neolithic Orkney"]. UNESCO. Retrieved 21 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The list also contains many large buildings from the Egyptian [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Age of the Pyramids]].

At Perperikon, a twelve days' journey from the sea, Medokos called himself king of Thrace after [[Sitalces]]'s death in 424 BC, but failed to hold a throne.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Webber and Angus McBride, ''The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46'' (Men-at-Arms), 2001, page 6: "... after Sitalkes' death, Xenophon would find that Medokos (based at Perperikon, twelve days' journey inland from the sea) called himself the king of [[Thrace]]. Medokos however was unable to stop Seuthes..."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perperikon]&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of pre-Columbian cultures''' includes those [[civilization]]s and [[culture]]s of [[the Americas]] which flourished prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas]].

==Cultural characteristics==
[[File:Watson Brake Aerial Illustration HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Watson Brake]], [[Louisiana]], 3500 BC]]
[[File:Tikal-Plaza-And-North-Acropolis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tikal]], [[Guatemala]], [[Maya civilization]].]]
Many [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations established permanent or urban settlements, [[agriculture]], and [[complex society|complex societal hierarchies]].
In North America, indigenous cultures in the [[Lower Mississippi Valley]] during the Middle Archaic period built complexes of multiple mounds, with several in Louisiana dated to 5600–5000 BP (3700 BC–3100 BC). [[Watson Brake]] is considered the oldest, multiple mound complex in the Americas, as it has been dated to 3500 BC.  It and other Middle Archaic sites were built by pre-ceramic, hunter-gatherer societies. They preceded the better known [[Poverty Point culture]] and its [[Poverty Point|elaborate complex]] by nearly 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="Preucel"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ccsmpug-xaoC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Hedgepeth+Middle+Archaic+site&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2wHOzYtK-q&amp;sig=3eKTCzKwSwl-S07zX8S-yEz7yv0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QI2yTou4BsKA2wXlmZHhAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hedgepeth%20Middle%20Archaic%20site&amp;f=false Robert W. Preucel, Stephen A. Mrozowski, ''Contemporary Archaeology in Theory: The New Pragmatism''], John Wiley and Sons, 2010, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The Mississippi Valley mound-building tradition extended into the Late Archaic period, longer than later southeastern mound building dependent on sedentary, agricultural societies.(Russo, 1996:285)&lt;ref name="Preucel"/&gt;

Some of these civilizations had long ceased to function by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th – early 16th centuries), and are known only through [[archaeology|archaeological]] investigations or [[oral history]] from nations today. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]], and [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] had their own written records.  However, most Europeans of the time viewed such texts as heretical and [[Book burning|burned]] most of them. Only a few documents were hidden and thus remain today, leaving modern historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.

From both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations at the time of European encounter possessed many impressive attributes, having populous cities, and having developed theories of astronomy and mathematics.

Where they persist, the societies and cultures which gave rise to these civilizations continue to adapt and evolve; they also uphold various traditions and practices which relate back to these earlier times, even if combined with those more recently adopted.

[[Human sacrifice]] was a religious practice principally characteristic of pre-Columbian Aztec civilization, although other Mesoamerican civilizations like the Maya and the Zapotec practiced it as well. The extent of the practice is debated by modern scholars.

'''Marc Léopold Benjamin Bloch''' ({{IPAc-en|b|l|ɒ|k}}; {{IPA-fr|maʁk blɔk|lang}}; 6 July 1886 – 16 June 1944) was a [[List of contemporary French historians|French historian]] who cofounded the highly influential [[Annales School]] of French social history. Bloch was a quintessential modernist. An assimilated [[History of Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jew]] from an academic family in Paris, he was deeply affected in his youth by the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. He studied at the elite [[École Normale Supérieure]]; in 1908–9 he studied at Berlin and Leipzig. He fought in the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for four years. In 1919 he became Lecturer in Medieval history at [[Strasbourg University]], after the German professors were all expelled; he was called to the University of Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history. He is best known for his pioneering studies ''French Rural History'' and ''Feudal Society'' and his posthumously-published unfinished meditation on the writing of history, ''[[The Historian's Craft]].'' A French soldier in both World Wars, he was captured and shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]] for his work in the [[French Resistance]].

English historian Denys Hays says he and [[Frederic William Maitland]] were "the two greatest historians of recent times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Denys Hay|title=Annalists and Historians: Western Historiography from the VIIIth to the XVIIIth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OV37CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=169|isbn=9781317274568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  French historian [[Fernand Braudel]] says Bloch and [[Lucien Febvre]] were, "the greatest historians of this century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=François Dosse|title=New History in France: The Triumph of the Annales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=279SfqpRV9EC&amp;pg=PA109|year=1994|publisher=U of Illinois Press|page=109|isbn=9780252063732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth and First World War==
Born in [[Lyon]] to a Jewish family, the son of the professor of ancient history [[Gustave Bloch]], Marc studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and [[Fondation Thiers]] in Paris, then at Berlin and Leipzig. He was an officer of infantry in [[World War I]], rising to the rank of captain and being awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]].

After the war, he went to the university at [[Strasbourg]], then in 1936 succeeded [[Henri Hauser]] as professor of [[economic history]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].

==Career==
In 1924 he published one of his most famous works ''Les rois thaumaturges: étude sur le caractère surnaturel attribué à la puissance royale particulièrement en France et en Angleterre'' (translated in English as ''The magic-working kings'' or ''The royal touch: sacred monarchy and scrofula in England and France'') in which he collected, described and studied the documents pertaining to the ancient tradition that the kings of the Middle Ages were able to cure the disease of [[scrofula]] simply by [[royal touch|touching]] people suffering from it.&lt;ref name="Dash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2011/11/history-heroes-marc-bloch/|title=History Heroes: Marc Bloch|last=Dash|first=Mike | authorlink = Mike Dash|date=December 9, 2011|work=Past Imperfect blog|publisher=[[Smithsonian magazine]]|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition has its roots in the magical role of kings in ancient societies. This work by Bloch had a great impact not only on the [[social history]] of the Middle Ages but also on [[cultural anthropology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Bloch's most important work centered on the study of [[feudalism]]. In 1939 he published a large work, available in a two-volume English translation as ''Feudal Society.'' In some ways, his most innovative work is his monograph 1931 ''French Rural History.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfnzN3uzXrAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=French Rural History: An Essay on its Basic Characteristics| isbn=9780520016606| last1=Bloch| first1=Marc| year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annales==
With colleague [[Lucien Febvre]] he founded the [[Annales School]] in 1929, by starting the new scholarly journal, ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' ("Annals of economic and social history"), which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities.

Bloch has had lasting influence in the field of [[historiography]] through his unfinished manuscript ''[[The Historian's Craft]]'', which he was working on at his death. Bloch's book is often considered one of the most important historiographical works of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Dash"/&gt;

==Historiography==
Bloch was highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)&lt;ref&gt;Jason Hilkovitch &amp; Max Fulkerson, "Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch" at [http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/geomet/histphil/test/vidal.html Vidal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909192633/http://wwwstage.valpo.edu/geomet/histphil/test/vidal.html |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917). In ''Méthodologie Historique'' (written in 1906 but not published until 1988), Bloch rejected the histoire événementielle (event history) of his mentors [[Charles-Victor Langlois]] and [[Charles Seignobos]] to argue for greater analysis of the role of structural and social phenomena in determining the outcome of historical events. Bloch was trying to reinvent history as a social science, but he departed significantly from Durkheim in his refusal to exclude psychology from history; Bloch maintained that the individual actor should be considered along with social forces. Bloch's methodology was also greatly influenced by his father, Gustave Bloch, a historian of the ancient world, and by 19th-century scholars such as [[Gabriel Monod]], [[Ernest Renan]], and [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]].

Bloch vigorously supported the idea of international scholarly cooperation and tried unsuccessfully to set up an international journal with American support. Bloch wrote some 500 reviews of German books and articles, While promoting the importance of German historiography and admiring its scholarly rigor, he repeatedly criticized [[Sonderweg|its nationalism]] and methodological limitations.

==Miracles and mentalities==
In ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Bloch looked at the long-standing [[folk belief]] that the king could cure [[Tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis|scrofula]] by touch. The kings of France and England indeed regularly practised the ritual. Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the [[royal touch]]—he acted like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long-duration studies spanning a thousand years (with specific events used as illustrations). By investigating the impact of [[rituals]], the efficacy of [[myths]], and all the possible sources of [[collective behavior]], he became the "father of historical anthropology." Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. Stirling (2007) examines this essentially stylistic trait alongside Bloch's peculiarly quixotic idealism, which tempered and sometimes compromised his work through his hope for a truly cooperative model of historical inquiry. While humanizing and questioning him, Stirling gives credit to Bloch for helping to break through the monotonous methodological alternance between [[positivism]] and [[narrative history]], creating a new, synthetic version of the historical practice that has since become so ingrained in the discipline that it is typically overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Stirling (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural history==
Bloch's own ideas on rural history were best expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'' (1939).

In ''L'Individualisme Agraire du XVIIIe Siècle'' (1978), Bloch characterized the [[agrarian reforms]] of 18th-century France as a "failed revolution," citing the persistence of regional traditions as evidence for their failure. A typical example of the Annales School's "total history," Bloch's argument weaves the connections between politics, culture, and economics against a backdrop of class conflict to illustrate how "the conscious actions of men have overcome the rhythms of the materialist causality of history." He argued that the anti-feudal sentiment of French peasants expressed in the 1789 ''cahier de doléances'' (list of grievances) was linked to the "seigneurial reaction" of the late 18th century in which lords significantly increased feudal dues. Bloch argued that it was this intensified exploitation that provoked peasant revolt, leading to the Revolution.

==History of technology==
The November 1935 issue of the ''Annales'' contains Febvre's introduction that defines three essential approaches to a [[history of technology]]: to investigate technology, to understand the progress of technology, and to understand the relationship of technology to other human activities. Bloch's article, "The Advent and Triumph of the Watermill in Medieval Europe," incorporates these approaches by investigating the connections between technology and broader social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela O. Long, "The Annales and the History of Technology: ''Annales D'histoire Economique et Sociale 7 (November 1935), Les Techniques, L'histoire et La Vie.''" ''[[Technology and Culture]]'' 2005 46(1): 177–186. {{ISSN|0040-165X}} Fulltext: [[Project Muse]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
In 1939 France declared war on Germany after its [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] and [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|occupation of Poland]]. As France [[Military mobilization|mobilized]] its troops, Marc Bloch left his position at the Sorbonne and took up his reserve status as a captain in the [[French Army]] at the age of 52. He was encouraged at the time by colleagues both in France and abroad to leave the country. He said it was his personal obligation to stand for the moral imperative.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was born in France, I have drunk the waters of her culture. I have made her past my own. I breathe freely only in her climate, and I have done my best, with others, to defend her interests.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, ''The Strange Defeat''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His memoir of the first days of World War II, ''[[Strange Defeat]],'' written in 1940 but not published until 1946, blamed the sudden total military defeat on the French military establishment, along with her social and political culture, and helped after the war to neutralize the traumatic memory of France's failure, and to build a new French identity.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, "Narratives of Resistance in Marc Bloch's ''L'etrange Defaite''." ''Modern and Contemporary France'' 2003 11(4): 443–452. {{ISSN|0963-9489}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloch joined the [[French Resistance]] in late 1942, driven by ardent patriotism, identification with his Jewish roots and a conception of France as the champion of liberty. His code name was "Narbonne". He was eventually captured in [[Lyon]] by [[Vichy France|Vichy]] police in March 1944 and turned over to the [[Gestapo]]. He was then imprisoned in Montluc prison, and was tortured by the Gestapo at their headquarters. He was interrogated by [[Klaus Barbie]] who was in charge of interrogations at the prison. Under such treatment Bloch remained "calm and stoic" throughout, according to his biographer [[Carole Fink]], reportedly providing no other information to his captors than his real name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dash|first1=Mike|title=History Heroes: Marc Bloch|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-heroes-marc-bloch-134082792/|website=Smithsonianmag|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
At around 8pm on the night of 16 June 1944, ten days after [[D-Day]], Marc Bloch was among twenty-eight Resistance prisoners taken by German troops in a ''camionette'' (an open truck) along the [[River Saone]] to a place called La Rousille just before the village of [[Saint-Didier-de-Formans]] in the [[Ain department]]. Here, shortly after 10.00 pm in a meadow surrounded by high bushes, Bloch was executed by firing squad, one of the first group of four of the twenty-eight,{{sfn| According to Georges Altman in 'Les Cahiers Politiques' 8 (1945): 2, Bloch, who had comforted a young fellow prisoner, was the first victim to fall, crying out, "Vive la France"; cited in Fink, p.322, n.89}} handcuffed in pairs, to face the machine guns, and one of twenty-six men to be murdered that night in a period of twenty minutes.{{sfn|Two of those shot, Jean Crespo and Charles Perrin, survived to bear witness to the murders in depositions taken 31 January and 2 February 1946}} The victims were stripped of all means of identification and left by the Germans in the field. The following day they were found by Marcel Pouveret, a schoolmaster, who informed the mayor of St Didier, to whom he was assistant, and the mayor called in the ''[[gendarmerie]]'' of [[Trevoux]] to bury the bodies.{{sfn|Carole Fink, 'Marc Bloch. A Life in History', pp.320-322}} &lt;ref name="Dash"/&gt; There is today a memorial to those killed in the meadow near where they were shot.

As Bloch had spent his final days in prison, he left unfinished one of his most intimate works and a classic of historiography, "The Historian's Craft" (''Apologie pour l'histoire ou Métier d'historien''), which was edited and published posthumously, by which time Marc Bloch had become a national martyr following the [[Liberation of France#Liberation of France|Allied liberation]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, by Bryce Lyon, of ''French Rural History'', X.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
*Bloch's focus on the ''[[longue durée]]'' and his emphasis upon structures underlying events led to misguided accusations of a denial of human agency and a marginalization of political history. In ''Strange Defeat'' he clearly states his view that individuals can change events and he castigates the French government's refusal to trust its own officers in the field of battle, thus leading to the surrender of France to the Nazis.
*In 1998 the University of Social Sciences in Strasbourg was renamed in honour of Bloch. [[Marc Bloch University]] became a constituent part of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on 1 January 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">'''Metahistorical Romance''' is a term describing postmodern historical fiction, defined by Amy J. Elias in ''Sublime Desire: History and Post-1960s Fiction.'' Elias defines metahistorical romance as a form of historical fiction continuing the legacy of historical romance inaugurated by [[Sir Walter Scott]] but also having ties to contemporary postmodern historiography. In particular, in metahistorical romance, poststructuralist play invokes the "historical sublime" as defined in the work of [[Hayden White]]. Metahistorical romance--such as [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]''--attempts to recuperate the sublime untouchability of the past, to reach History and know it, but paradoxically in the context of the political. As with the Kantian sublime, the postmodern historical sublime is not the grasp of the sublime object itself but a kind of ironic awareness of the inaccessibility of the sublime object. There is a yearning that resembles the yearning for mystical knowledge at the core of the search for the historical sublime, and thus the concept ties contemporary historical fiction to a literary history (that of the historical novel), a type of historiography (postmodern, post-''[[Annales School|Annales]]'' historiography), and a spiritual questing. Elias argues that the postmodern imagination confronts the historical sublime rather than represses it; confronts it as repetition and deferral; seeks sublime History but simultaneously has lost faith in the storytelling needed to do so; and consequently has ties to, but reverses the dominant of, the traditional Anglo-American historical novel. The term "metahistorical romance" also builds upon work by [[Linda Hutcheon]], whose term "[[historiographic metafiction]]" described the ironic stance of contemporary historical fiction.

[[File:Apollo 11 Crew During Training Exercise - GPN-2002-000032.jpg|thumb|[[Astronaut]]s [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Neil Armstrong]] in NASA's training [[mockup]] of the Moon and lander module. Conspiracy theorists say that the films of the missions were made using sets similar to this training mockup.]]

'''Moon landing conspiracy theories''' claim that some or all elements of the [[Apollo program]] and the associated [[Moon landing]]s were [[hoax]]es staged by [[NASA]], possibly with the aid of other organizations.

[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracists]] have managed to sustain public interest in their theories for more than 40 years, despite the rebuttals and third-party evidence. Opinion polls taken in various locations have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the manned landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television network]] documentary ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?'' claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the [[Space Race]].&lt;ref name="greatmoonhoax"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast23feb_2/ |title=The Great Moon Hoax |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=February 23, 2001 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
An early and influential book about the subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, ''We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle'', was [[Self-publishing|self-published]] in 1976 by [[Bill Kaysing]], a former [[U.S. Navy|US Navy]] officer with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Kaysing was hired as a senior [[technical writer]] in 1956 by [[Rocketdyne]], the company that built the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engines used on the [[Saturn V]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billkaysing.com/biography.php |title=A brief biography of Bill Kaysing |last=Kaysing |first=Wendy L. |publisher=BillKaysing.com |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked.&lt;ref name=k-pg7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], it would have been easier for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm |title=Did we land on the Moon? |last=Braeunig |first=Robert A. |date=November 2006 |website=Rocket and Space Technology |publisher=Robert Braeunig |accessdate=May 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522183404/http://www.braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billkaysing.com/hoaxtheory.php |last=Galuppini |first=Albino |title=Hoax Theory |publisher=BillKaysing.com |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Flat Earth Society]] accused NASA of faking the landings, arguing that they were staged by Hollywood with [[Walt Disney]] sponsorship, based on a script by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In 1968, Clarke and Kubrick had collaborated on the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', which realistically portrayed a Moon mission.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schadewald |first=Robert J. |authorlink=Robert Schadewald |date=July 1980 |title=The Flat-out Truth: Earth Orbits?

She notes that this happened during the post-[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] era, when American citizens were [[Credibility gap|inclined to distrust official accounts]].

After Kaysing, Moon-landing conspiracists include (in alphabetical order):
* [[Marcus Allen (publisher)|Marcus Allen]] – British publisher of ''[[Nexus (magazine)|Nexus]]'', who said photographs of the lander would not prove that the United States put men on the Moon, and "Getting to the Moon really isn't much of a problem – [[Luna 2|the Russians did that in 1959]].

He suggests that NASA sent robot missions because [[radiation]] levels in [[outer space]] would be deadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's biggest telescope to prove Americans really walked on Moon |first=Robert |last=Matthews |authorlink=Robert Matthews (scientist) |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1414144/Worlds-biggest-telescope-to-prove-Americans-really-walked-on-Moon.html |date=November 24, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |location=London |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this idea has it that NASA and its contractors did not recover quickly enough from the [[Apollo 1]] fire, and so all the early Apollo missions were faked, with [[Apollo 14|Apollos 14]] or [[Apollo 15|15]] being the first real mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosmoquest.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-1180.html |title=Irrefutable proof [Archive&amp;#93; – Bad Astronomy and Universe Today Forum |date=May 3, 2002 |publisher=[[Bad Astronomy]] |type=Forum |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claimed motives of the United States and NASA ==
Those who believe the Moon landings were faked give several theories about the motives of NASA and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. The three main theories are below.

=== The Space Race ===
Motivation for the United States to engage the [[Soviet Union]] in a [[Space Race]] can be traced to the then on-going [[Cold War]]. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim. But going to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as exemplified by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy#Space program|John F. Kennedy]] famously stating in [[We choose to go to the Moon|a 1962 speech]] that the [[United States]] chose to go ''because'' it was hard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 2007]], p. 2, "We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things – not because they are easy, but because they are ''hard.''" – Kennedy speaking at [[Rice University]], September 12, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoax theory-debunker [[Philip Plait]] says in his book ''[[Bad Astronomy]]'', that the Soviets – with [[Soviet manned lunar programs|their own competing Moon program]], an [[nuclear espionage|extensive intelligence network]] and a formidable scientific community able to analyze NASA data – would have cried foul if the United States tried to fake a Moon landing,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; especially since their own program had failed. Proving a hoax would have been a huge propaganda win for the Soviets. Conspiracist [[Bart Sibrel]] responded, "the Soviets did not have the capability to track deep space craft until late in 1972, immediately after which, the last three Apollo missions were abruptly canceled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmovie.com/faq.htm |title=Moon Hoax MOONMOVIE.COM Frequently Asked Questions |work=Moonmovie.com |publisher=AFTH, LLC |location=Nashville, TN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212134517/http://www.moonmovie.com/faq.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the Soviets had been sending [[unmanned spacecraft]] to the Moon since 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/gal114/SpaceRace/sec300/sec361.htm |title=Soviet Lunar Programs |website=Space Race |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Online version of exhibition on view in Gallery 114 |accessdate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "during 1962, deep space tracking facilities were introduced at IP-15 in [[Ussuriysk|Ussuriisk]] and IP-16 in [[Yevpatoria|Evpatoria]] (Crimean Peninsula), while Saturn communication stations were added to IP-3, 4 and 14,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kik.html |title=Russia's space command and control infrastructure |last=Zak |first=Anatoly |website=RussianSpaceWeb.com |publisher=Anatoly Zak |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708063431/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kik.html |archivedate=July 8, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter having a 100 million km range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/sovstems.htm |title=Soviet Space Tracking Systems |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |publisher=Mark Wade |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101224934/http://www.astronautix.com/articles/sovstems.htm |archivedate=November 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union tracked the Apollo missions at the Space Transmissions Corps, which was "fully equipped with the latest intelligence-gathering and surveillance equipment."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scheaffer|Scheaffer 2004]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasily Mishin]], in an interview for the article "The Moon Programme That Faltered," describes how the Soviet Moon program dwindled after the Apollo landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 1991 |title=The Moon Programme That Faltered |journal=[[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]] |volume=33 |pages=2–3 |location=London |publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]|bibcode=1991SpFl...33....2. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there was nothing "abrupt" about the [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo cancelations]], which were announced in January and September 1970 for cost-cutting reasons.&lt;ref name="Cancelled Apollos"&gt;"[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_18_20.html Apollo 18 through 20 – The Canceled Missions]", Dr. David R. Williams, NASA, accessed July 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (See '''Vietnam War''' below.)

=== NASA funding and prestige ===
Conspiracy theorists claim that NASA faked the landings to avoid humiliation and to ensure that it continued to get funding. NASA raised "about US$30 billion" to go to the Moon, and [[Bill Kaysing|Kaysing]] claimed in his book that this could have been used to "pay off" many people.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Since most conspiracists believe that sending men to the Moon was impossible at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Attivissimo|Attivissimo 2013]], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; they argue that landings had to be faked to fulfill Kennedy's 1961 goal, "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."&lt;ref name="Special Message"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Kennedy, John F. |date=May 25, 1961 |title=Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs |medium=Motion picture (excerpt) |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/xzw1gaeeTES6khED14P1Iw.aspx |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |location=Boston, MA |id=Accession Number: TNC:200; Digital Identifier: TNC-200-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, NASA accounted for the cost of Apollo to the US Congress in 1973, totaling US$25.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science and Astronautics |title=1974 NASA Authorization Hearings |type=Hearing on H.R. 4567 |year=1973 |publisher=[[93rd United States Congress|93rd Congress]], first session |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=23229007 |ref=93rd Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Bennett and David Percy have claimed in ''Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers'', that, with all the known and unknown hazards,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; NASA would not risk broadcasting an astronaut getting sick or dying on live television.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], pp. 330–31&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-argument generally given is that NASA in fact ''did'' incur a great deal of public humiliation and potential political opposition to the program by losing an entire crew in the [[Apollo 1]] fire during a ground test, leading to its upper management team being questioned by Senate and House of Representatives space oversight committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Vietnam War ===
The American Patriot Friends Network claimed in 2009 that the landings helped the United States government distract public attention from the unpopular [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Americanization|Vietnam War]], and so manned landings suddenly ended about the same time that the United States ended its involvement in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/moon.htm |title=Was The Apollo Moon Landing Fake? |date=July 21, 2009 |website=American Patriot Friends Network (APFN) |publisher=APFN.org |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the ending of the landings was not "sudden" (see '''The Space Race''' above). The war was one of several federal budget items with which NASA had to compete; NASA's budget peaked in 1966, and fell by 42.3% by 1972.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Office of Management and Budget&lt;/ref&gt; This was the reason the final flights were cut, along with plans for even more ambitious follow-on programs such as a permanent [[space station]] and manned flight to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Hepplewhite, T.A. [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/sp4221.htm ''The Space Shuttle Decision: NASA's Search for a Reusable Space Vehicle''], chapter 4. Washington, DC: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hoax claims and rebuttals==
Many Moon-landing conspiracy theories have been put forward, claiming either that the landings did not happen and that NASA employees have lied, or that the landings did happen but not in the way that has been told. Conspiracists have focused on perceived gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record of the missions. The foremost idea is that the whole manned landing program was a hoax from start to end. Some claim that the technology to send men to the Moon was lacking or that the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, [[solar flare]]s, [[solar wind]], [[coronal mass ejection]]s and [[cosmic ray]]s made such a trip impossible.&lt;ref name=k-pg7&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Vince Calder and Andrew Johnson, scientists from [[Argonne National Laboratory]], have given detailed answers to  conspiracists' claims on the laboratory's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen01/gen01278.htm |last1=Calder |first1=Vince |last2=Johnson |first2=Andrew, P.E.|last3=ProfHoff 503 |title=Ask A Scientist|date=October 12, 2002|work=Newton |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=August 14, 2009 |display-authors=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They show that NASA's portrayal of the Moon landing is fundamentally accurate, allowing for such common mistakes as mislabeled photos and imperfect personal recollections. Using the [[scientific process]], any hypothesis that is contradicted by the observable facts may be rejected. The 'real landing' hypothesis is a single story since it comes from a single source, but there is no unity in the hoax hypothesis because hoax accounts vary between conspiracists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ramsay|Ramsay 2006]] (page needed)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of conspirators involved ===
According to [[James Longuski]] (Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at [[Purdue University]]), the conspiracy theories are impossible because of their size and complexity. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people who worked on the Apollo project for nearly ten years, the 12 men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon.&lt;ref group=Note&gt; This number includes the crews of Apollos 8, [[Apollo 10|10]], and [[Apollo 13|13]], though the latter technically only performed a fly-by. These three missions account for only six additional astronauts because James Lovell orbited the Moon twice (Apollos 8 and 13) and John Young and Gene Cernan orbited on Apollo 10 both later landed on the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of people – including astronauts, scientists, engineers, technicians, and skilled laborers – would have had to keep the secret. Longuski argues that it would have been much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Longuski|Longuski 2006]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aaronovitch|Aaronovitch 2010]], pp. 1–2, 6&lt;/ref&gt; To date, nobody from the United States government or NASA linked to the Apollo program has said the Moon landings were hoaxes. [[Penn Jillette]] made note of this in the "Conspiracy Theories" episode of his television show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="bullshit"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Conspiracy Theories |series=[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]] |network=[[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] |airdate=May 9, 2005 |season=3 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the number of people involved, and noting the [[Watergate scandal]], Jillette noted that ''someone'' would have outed the hoax by now.

=== Photographic and film oddities ===
{{Main|Examination of Apollo Moon photographs}}

Moon-landing conspiracists focus heavily on NASA photos. They point to oddities in photos and films taken on the Moon. Photography experts (including those unrelated to NASA) have replied that the oddities are consistent with what should be expected from a real Moon landing, and are not consistent with tweaked or studio imagery. Some main arguments and counter-arguments are listed below.

1. In some photos, the [[Reticle|crosshairs]] appear to be behind objects. The cameras were fitted with a [[Réseau plate]] (a clear glass plate with a [[reticle]] etched on), making it impossible for any photographed object to appear "in front" of the grid. Conspiracists often use this evidence to suggest that objects were "pasted" over the photographs, and hence obscure the reticle.

:* ''This effect only appears in copied and scanned photos, not any originals. It is caused by overexposure: the bright white areas of the emulsion "bleed" over the thin black crosshairs. The crosshairs are only about 0.004 inches thick (0.1 mm) and emulsion would only have to bleed about half that much to fully obscure it. Furthermore, there are many photos where the middle of the crosshair is "washed-out" but the rest is intact. In some photos of the American flag, parts of one crosshair appear on the red stripes, but parts of the same crosshair are faded or invisible on the white stripes. There would have been no reason to "paste" white stripes onto the flag.&lt;ref name="clavius-crosshairs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/photoret.html |title=Clavius: Photography – Crosshairs |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Crosshairs are sometimes rotated or in the wrong place.

:* ''This is a result of popular photos being cropped and/or rotated for aesthetic impact.''&lt;ref name="clavius-crosshairs" /&gt;

3. The quality of the photographs is implausibly high.

4. There are no [[star]]s in any of the photos; the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts also stated in post-mission press conferences that they did not remember seeing any stars during [[Extravehicular activity|EVA]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], pp. 20, 21, 22, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracists contend that [[NASA]] chose not to put the stars into the [[photograph|photo]]s because [[astronomer]]s would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or the [[Moon]], by means of identifying them and comparing their celestial position and [[parallax]] to what would be expected for either observation site.

:* ''The astronauts were talking about naked-eye sightings of stars during the lunar daytime. They regularly sighted stars through the spacecraft navigation optics while aligning their inertial reference platforms, the [[Apollo PGNCS]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-AOTNavStarsDetents.html |title=Navigation Stars used in the AOT |last1=Jones |first1=Eric M. |date=January 21, 2012 |website=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Stars are rarely seen in [[Space Shuttle]], [[Mir]], Earth observation photos, or even photos taken at sporting events held at night. The light from the [[Sun]] in outer space in the Earth-Moon system is at least as bright as the [[sunlight]] that reaches the Earth's surface on a clear day at noon, so [[camera]]s used for imaging subjects illuminated by sunlight are set for a [[Sunny 16 rule|daylight exposure]]. The dim light of the stars simply does not provide enough [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] to record visible images. All manned landings happened during the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around them so that they could not see the relatively faint stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2011/09/28/where-are-the-stars/?src=twitter-em |title=Where are the stars? |last=Carlowicz |first=Mike |date=September 28, 2011 |work=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |publisher=NASA |type=Blog |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 158–60&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were in the shadow of the Moon.''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woods|Woods 2008]], pp. 206–07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Lamp-and-moon-example-2.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off. 

:* ''A special far [[ultraviolet]] camera, the [[Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph]], was taken to the lunar surface on [[Apollo 16]] and operated in the shadow of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM). It took photos of Earth and of many stars, some of which are dim in visible light but bright in the ultraviolet. These observations were later matched with observations taken by orbiting ultraviolet telescopes. Furthermore, the positions of those stars with respect to Earth are correct for the time and location of the Apollo 16 photos.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keel |first=William C. |date=July 2007 |title=The Earth and Stars in the Lunar Sky |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=47–50 |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/Apollo16EarthID.gif |title=Apollo16EarthID.gif |last=Keel |first=William C. |website=UA Astronomy Home Page  |format=[[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] |accessdate=May 8, 2013}} Base image: AS16-123-19657; Earth image start: 1233 CDT 21 April 1972; Field shown: 18.9 degrees.&lt;/ref&gt;

5. The angle and color of shadows are inconsistent. This suggests that artificial lights were used.

:* ''Shadows on the Moon are complicated by reflected light, uneven ground, [[wide-angle lens]] distortion, and [[lunar dust]]. There are several light sources: the Sun, sunlight reflected from the Earth, sunlight reflected from the Moon's surface, and sunlight reflected from the astronauts and the Lunar Module. Light from these sources is scattered by lunar dust in many directions, including into shadows. Shadows falling into craters and hills may appear longer, shorter and distorted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 167–72&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, shadows display the properties of [[vanishing point]] perspective, leading them to converge to a point on the horizon.''
:* This theory was further debunked on the ''[[MythBusters]]'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

6. There are identical backgrounds in photos which, according to their captions, were taken miles apart. This suggests that a painted background was used.

:* ''Backgrounds were not identical, just similar. What appear as nearby hills in some photos are actually mountains many miles away. On Earth, objects that are further away will appear fainter and less detailed.

7. The number of photos taken is implausibly high. Up to one photo per 50 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aulis.com/skeleton.htm |title=The skeleton in NASA's spacesuit |last=White |first=Jack |year=2005 |website=AULIS Online |publisher=AULIS Publishing |location=London |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Simplified gear with fixed settings allowed two photos a second. Many were taken immediately after each other as stereo pairs or panorama sequences. The calculation (one per 50 seconds) was based on a lone astronaut on the surface, and does not take into account that there were two astronauts sharing the workload and simultaneously taking photographs during an [[Extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA).''

8. The photos contain artifacts like the two seemingly matching 'C's on a rock and on the ground. These may be labeled studio props.

:* ''The "C"-shaped objects are most likely printing imperfections and do not appear in the original film from the camera. It has been suggested that the "C" is a coiled hair.&lt;ref name="whomourns" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/rover1.html |title=Clavius: Photo Analysis – lunar rover |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

9. A resident of [[Perth|Perth, Western Australia]], a woman named Una Ronald (a pseudonym created by the authors of the source&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;), said that for two or three seconds she saw a [[Coca-Cola]] bottle roll across the lower right quadrant of her television screen that was displaying the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 EVA. She also said that several letters appeared in ''[[The West Australian]]'' discussing the Coca-Cola bottle incident within ten days of the lunar landing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], pp. 319–20&lt;/ref&gt;

10. The book ''[[Moon Shot]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shepard &amp; Slayton|Shepard &amp; Slayton 1994]] (page needed)&lt;/ref&gt; contains an obviously fake composite photo of Alan Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon with another astronaut.

:* '' It was used instead of the only existing real images, from the TV monitor, which the editors seemingly felt were too grainy for their book. The book publishers did not work for NASA.''

11. There appear to be "hot spots" in some photos that look like a large spotlight was used in place of the sun.

:* '' Pits on the Moon's surface focus and reflect light like the tiny glass spheres used in the coating of street signs, or dewdrops on wet grass. This creates a glow around the photographer's own shadow when it appears in a photograph (see [[Heiligenschein]]).''
:* ''If the astronaut is standing in sunlight while photographing into shade, light reflected off his white spacesuit yields a similar effect to a spotlight.&lt;ref name="bootspot" /&gt;''
:* ''Some widely published Apollo photos were high-contrast copies. Scans of the original transparencies are generally much more evenly lit. An example is shown below:''

12. Who filmed Neil Armstrong stepping onto the Moon?

:* ''The Lunar Module did. While still on the Module's ladder steps, Armstrong deployed the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly from the side of the Lunar Module, unpacking, amongst other things, the TV camera. The TV camera was then powered on and a signal transmitted to the command module, which beamed the live signal back to Earth. This meant that upwards of 600 million people on Earth could watch the live feed with only a very slight delay. Similar technology was also used on subsequent Apollo missions.''

=== Environment ===
1. The astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to radiation from the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] and galactic ambient radiation (see [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]] and [[health threat from cosmic rays]]). Some conspiracists have suggested that [[Starfish Prime]] (a [[High-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test]] in 1962) was a failed attempt to disrupt the Van Allen belts.

:* ''There are two main Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a transient third belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/28feb_thirdbelt/ |title=Van Allen Probes Discover a New Radiation Belt |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |date=February 28, 2013 |editor-last=Phillips |editor-first=Tony |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons. The outer one has less-dangerous low-energy electrons ([[Beta particle]]s).&lt;ref name="vanallenbelts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/tour/AAvan.html |title=The Van Allen Belts |website=IMAGE Science Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="woods109"&gt;[[#Woods|Woods 2008]], p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo spacecraft passed through the inner belt in a matter of minutes and the outer belt in about {{frac|1|1|2}} hours.&lt;ref name="woods109" /&gt; The astronauts were shielded from the ionizing radiation by the aluminum hulls of the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="woods109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plait162"&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the orbital transfer trajectory from Earth to the Moon through the belts was chosen to lessen radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="plait162" /&gt; Even Dr. [[James Van Allen]], the discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belts, rebutted the claims that radiation levels were too harmful for the Apollo missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clavius.org/envrad.html |title=Clavius: Environment – radiation and the van allen belts |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plait cited an average dose of less than 1&amp;nbsp;[[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]] (10&amp;nbsp;[[Sievert|mSv]]), which is equivalent to the ambient radiation received by living at sea level for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 160–62&lt;/ref&gt; The total radiation received on the trip was about the same as allowed for workers in the nuclear energy field for a year''&lt;ref name="woods109" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/s2ch3.htm |title=Radiation Protection and Instrumentation |last=Bailey |first=J.

2. Film in the cameras would have been fogged by this radiation.

:* ''The film was kept in metal containers that stopped radiation from fogging the film's emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, film carried by unmanned lunar probes such as the [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] and [[Luna 3]] (which used on-board film development processes) was not fogged.''

3. The Moon's surface during the daytime is so hot that camera film would have melted.

:* ''There is no atmosphere to efficiently bind lunar surface heat to devices (such as cameras) that are not in direct contact with it. In a [[vacuum]], only radiation remains as a heat transfer mechanism. The physics of radiative heat transfer are thoroughly understood, and the proper use of passive optical coatings and paints was enough to control the temperature of the film within the cameras; Lunar Module temperatures were controlled with similar coatings that gave them a gold color. Also, while the Moon's surface does get very hot at lunar noon, every Apollo landing was made shortly after lunar sunrise at the landing site; the [[Lunar day|Moon's day]] is about 29½ Earth days long, meaning that one Moon day (dawn to dusk) lasts nearly fifteen Earth days. During the longer stays, the astronauts did notice increased cooling loads on their spacesuits as the sun and surface temperature continued to rise, but the effect was easily countered by the passive and active cooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 165–67&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not in direct sunlight, so it was not overheated.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clavius.org/envheat.html |title=Clavius: Environment – heat |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

4. The Apollo 16 crew could not have survived a big [[solar flare]] firing out when they were on their way to the Moon.

:* ''No large solar flare occurred during the flight of Apollo 16. There were large solar flares in August 1972, after Apollo 16 returned to Earth and before the flight of [[Apollo 17]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/27jan_solarflares/ |title=Sickening Solar Flares |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=January 27, 2005 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615021549/http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/27jan_solarflares/ |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Predicting Solar Eruptions |first=Selby |last=Cull |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3422566.html?page=1&amp;c=y |work=News from Sky &amp; Telescope |publisher=Sky Publishing |date=July 12, 2006 |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5. The [[Lunar Flag Assembly|flag]] placed on the surface by the astronauts fluttered despite there being no wind on the Moon. This suggests that it was filmed on Earth and a breeze caused the flag to flutter. Sibrel said that it may have been caused by indoor fans used to cool the astronauts since their spacesuit cooling systems would have been too heavy on Earth.

:* ''The flag was fastened to a'' Г-''shaped rod (see [[Lunar Flag Assembly]]) so that it did not hang down. The flag only seemed to flutter when the astronauts were moving it into position. Without air drag, these movements caused the free corner of the flag to swing like a [[pendulum]] for some time. The flag was rippled because it had been folded during storage – the ripples could be mistaken for movement in a still photo. Videos show that when the astronauts let go of the flagpole it vibrates briefly but then remains still''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/envflutter.html |title=Clavius: Environment: fluttering flags |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#McAdams|McAdams 2011]], p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

6. Footprints in the [[Moondust]] are unexpectedly well preserved, despite the lack of moisture.

:* ''Moondust has not been weathered like Earth sand and has sharp edges. This allows the dust particles to stick together and hold their shape in the vacuum. The astronauts likened it to "talcum powder or wet sand".''&lt;ref name="whomourns" /&gt;
:* This theory was further debunked on the ''MythBusters'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

7. The alleged Moon landings used either a sound stage or were filmed outside in a remote desert with the astronauts either using harnesses or slow-motion photography to make it look like they were on the Moon.

:* ''While the [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] "[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]", and a scene from the movie "[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]" used the sound-stage and harness setup, it is clearly seen from those films that when dust rose it did not quickly settle; some dust briefly formed clouds. In the film footage from the Apollo missions, dust kicked up by the astronauts' boots and the wheels of the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s rose quite high due to the lower lunar gravity, and settled quickly to the ground in an uninterrupted parabolic arc since there was no air to suspend the dust. Even if there had been a sound stage for hoax Moon landings that had the air pumped out, the dust would have reached nowhere near the height and trajectory as in the Apollo film footage because of Earth's greater gravity.

:* ''During the Apollo 15 mission, [[David Scott]] did an experiment by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather at the same time. Both fell at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time. This proved that he was in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |title=Hammer Versus Feather on the Moon |date=November 1, 2011 |access-date=April 20, 2013}} Source for video: {{YouTube|id=4mTsrRZEMwA|title="The Hammer and the Feather"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''If the landings were filmed outside in a desert, heat waves would be present on the surface in mission videos, but no such heat waves exist in the footage. If the landings were filmed in a sound stage, several anomalies would occur, including a lack of parallax, and an increase or decrease in the size of the backdrop if the camera moved (footage was filmed while the rover was in motion, and yet no evidence of any change in the size of the background is present).

:* This theory was further debunked on the ''MythBusters'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

=== Mechanical issues ===
[[File:Apollo11 under LM.jpg|right|thumb|Under the Apollo 11 Lunar Module]]

1. The Lunar Modules made no blast [[Explosion crater|craters]] or any sign of dust scatter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''No crater should be expected. The 10,000-pound thrust [[Descent Propulsion System]] was throttled very far down during the final landing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander's own weight, which was lessened by the Moon's gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about 10 [[Pascal (unit)|kilopascals]] (1.5 [[Pounds per square inch|PSI]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket exhaust gasses expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander's exhaust gasses, therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines &lt;u&gt;did&lt;/u&gt; scatter a lot of very fine surface dust as seen in [[16 mm film|16mm movies]] of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar [[regolith]] is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a "crater".&lt;ref name=ba-pg163-165&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 163–65&lt;/ref&gt; A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and how deep the lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface and it was found that the engine had eroded between 4 and 6 inches of regolith out from underneath the engine bell during the final descent and landing.''&lt;ref name="as11psr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/as11psr.pdf |title=Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report |year=1969 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |id=NASA SP-214 |accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. The second stage of the launch rocket and/or the Lunar Module [[Apollo Lunar Module#Ascent stage|ascent stage]] made no visible flame.

:* ''The Lunar Modules used [[Aerozine 50]] (fuel) and [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (oxidizer) propellants, chosen for simplicity and reliability; they ignite [[hypergolic propellant|hypergolically]] – upon contact – without the need for a spark. These propellants produce a nearly [[transparent materials|transparent]] exhaust.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woods|Woods 2008]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The same fuel was used by the core of the American [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] rocket. The transparency of their plumes is apparent in many launch photos. The plumes of rocket engines fired in a vacuum spread out very quickly as they leave the engine nozzle (see above), further lessening their visibility. Finally, rocket engines often run "rich" to slow internal corrosion. On Earth, the excess fuel burns in contact with atmospheric oxygen, enhancing the visible flame. This cannot happen in a vacuum.''

&lt;/center&gt;

3. The Lunar Modules weighed 17 tons and made no mark on the Moondust, yet footprints can be seen beside them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#René|René 1994]] pp. n, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''On the surface of the Earth, Apollo 11's fueled and crewed Lunar Module, Eagle, would have weighed approximately 17 [[short ton]]s (15,300&amp;nbsp;kg). On the surface of the Moon, however, after expending fuel and oxidizer on her descent from lunar orbit, the lander weighed about {{convert|2698|lb|kg|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |website=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |isbn=0-16-050631-X |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |accessdate=May 31, 2013}} See Statistical Tables: [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-37_Selected_Mission_Weights.htm "Selected Mission Weights (lbs)"] and [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-28a_LM_Descent_Stage_Propellant_Status.htm "LM Descent Stage Propellant Status"].&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts were much lighter than the lander, but their boots were much smaller than the lander's approximately {{convert|3|ft|cm|adj=on}} diameter footpads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM_Landing%20Gear1973010151.pdf |title=Apollo Lunar Module Landing Gear |last=Rogers |first=William F. |work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure (or force per unit area) rather than mass determines the amount of regolith compression. In some photos, the footpads &lt;u&gt;did&lt;/u&gt; press into the regolith, especially when they moved sideways at touchdown. (The bearing pressure under Apollo 11's footpads, with the lander being about 44 times the weight of an EVA-configured astronaut, would have been of similar magnitude to the bearing pressure exerted by the astronauts' boots.)''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heiken|Heiken 1991]], pp. 475–476&lt;/ref&gt;

4. The air conditioning units that were part of the astronauts' spacesuits could not have worked in an environment of no atmosphere.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

:* ''The cooling units could &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; work in a vacuum. Water from a tank in the backpack flowed out through tiny pores in a metal [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimator]] plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of vaporization froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice on the outside of the plate that also sublimated into space (turning from a solid directly into a gas). A separate water loop flowed through the LCG ([[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment|Liquid Cooling Garment]]) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. {{convert|12|lb|kg|spell=In}} of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.

[[File:Surveyor 3-Apollo 12.jpg|thumb|right|[[Surveyor 3]] with [[Apollo 12]] lander in background]]

=== Transmissions ===
1. There should have been more than a two-second delay in communications between Earth and the Moon, at a distance of {{convert|400000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

:* ''The round trip light travel time of more than two seconds is apparent in all the real-time recordings of the lunar audio, but this does not always appear as expected. There may also be some documentary films where the delay has been edited out. Reasons for editing the audio may be time constraints or in the interest of clarity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/Radio.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729183941/http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/Radio.htm |archivedate=July 29, 2008 |title=Radio Lag |publisher=Redzero.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Typical delays in communication were about 0.5 seconds.

:* ''Claims that the delays were only half a second are untrue, as examination of the original recordings shows. Also, there should not be a consistent time delay between every response, as the conversation is being recorded at one end – [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]]. Responses from Mission Control could be heard without any delay, as the recording is being made at the same time that Houston receives the transmission from the Moon.''

3. The [[Parkes Observatory]] in Australia was billed to the world for weeks as the site that would be relaying communications from the first moonwalk. However, five hours before transmission they were told to stand down.

:* ''The timing of the first moonwalk was changed after the landing.

Dr. David R. Williams (NASA archivist at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]) and Apollo 11 flight director [[Gene Kranz|Eugene F. Kranz]] both acknowledged that the original high-quality Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed.&lt;ref name="didwego" /&gt; The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV) camera (see [[Apollo TV camera]]). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a [[scan conversion]] had to be done. The [[radio telescope]] at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon at the time of the Apollo 11 moonwalk.&lt;ref name="eagleswings2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |title=On Eagle's Wings: The Parkes Observatory's Support of the Apollo 11 Mission |year=2001 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=287–310 |location=Collingwood, Victoria |publisher=[[CSIRO Publishing]] for the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]] |doi=10.1071/AS01038 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/|bibcode = 2001PASA...18..287S }} October 2000 website version, part 1 of 12: "Introduction."

It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]]. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/Parkes_Apollo11_TV_quality.html |title=The Parkes Apollo 11 TV Quality |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |publisher=[[Parkes Observatory|CSIRO Parkes Observatory]] |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur [[8 mm film]] camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|ALSEP]] scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.&lt;ref name="Amalfi"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lost Moon landing tapes discovered |last=Amalfi |first=Carmelo |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/lost-moon-landing-tapes-discovered/ |work=COSMOS Online |publisher=Cosmos Media Pty Ltd |location=Australia |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214030100/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/lost-moon-landing-tapes-discovered/ |archivedate=February 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are looking for the missing telemetry tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The tapes are believed to have been stored rather than re-used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/Apollo_11/tapes/Search_for_SSTV_Tapes.pdf |title=The Search for the Apollo 11 SSTV Tapes |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |date=May 21, 2006 |website=Honeysucklecreek.net |publisher=CSIRO Parkes Observatory |format=PDF |accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670010532_1967010532.pdf| accessdate=September 5, 2009| format=PDF| title=The GSFC Scientific Data Storage Problem| publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; even before the Moon landings.

In November 2006, [[Cosmos (magazine)|COSMOS Online]] reported that about 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in a small marine science laboratory in the main physics building at the [[Curtin University of Technology]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]]. One of the old tapes has been sent to NASA for analysis. The slow-scan television images were not on the tape.&lt;ref name="Amalfi" /&gt;

In July 2009, NASA indicated that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could re-use the tape. In December 2009 NASA issued a final report on the Apollo 11 telemetry tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/Apollo_11_TV_Tapes_Report.pdf |title=The Apollo 11 Telemetry Data Recordings: A Final Report |date=December 2009 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior engineer Dick Nafzger, who was in charge of the live TV recordings during the Apollo missions, was put in charge of the restoration project. After a three-year search, the "inescapable conclusion" was that about 45 tapes (estimated 15 tapes recorded at each of the three tracking stations) of Apollo 11 video were erased and re-used, said Nafzger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/07/17/nasa-lost-moon-footage-but-hollywood-restores-it |title=NASA lost moon footage, but Hollywood restores it |date=July 17, 2009 |first=Seth |last=Borenstein |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[US News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, [[Lowry Digital]] had been tasked with restoring the surviving footage. Lowry Digital president Mike Inchalik said that, "this is by far and away the lowest quality" video the company has dealt with. Nafzger praised Lowry for restoring "crispness" to the Apollo video, which will remain in black and white and contains conservative digital enhancements. The US$230,000 restoration project took months to complete and did not include sound quality improvements. Some selections of restored footage in high-definition have been made available on the NASA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/hd/apollo11.html |title=Apollo 11 Partial Restoration HD Video Streams |date=August 7, 2009 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Robert |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology ===
{{See also|Space Race|List of space exploration milestones, 1957–1969}}

Bart Sibrel cites the relative level of the United States and USSR space technology as evidence that the Moon landings could not have happened. For much of the early stages of the Space Race, the USSR was ahead of the United States, yet in the end, the USSR was never able to fly a manned craft to the Moon, let alone land one on the surface. It is argued that, because the USSR was unable to do this, the United States should have also been unable to develop the technology to do so.

For example, he claims that, during the Apollo program, the USSR had five times more manned hours in space than the United States, and notes that the USSR was the first to achieve many of the early milestones in space: the first man-made [[satellite]] in [[orbit]] (October 1957, [[Sputnik 1]]);&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to the 2007 ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' episode "[[List of Nova episodes#Season 35: 2007–2008|Sputnik Declassified]]," the United States could have launched the ''[[Explorer 1]]'' probe before Sputnik, but the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration hesitated, first because they were not sure if international law meant that national borders kept going all the way into orbit (and, thus, their orbiting satellite could cause an international uproar by violating the borders of dozens of nations), and second because there was a desire to see the not yet ready [[Project Vanguard|Vanguard satellite program]], designed by American citizens, become America's first satellite rather than the Explorer program, that was mostly designed by former rocket designers from [[Nazi Germany]]. A transcript of the appropriate section from the show is available at "[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/sputnik-impact-on-america.html Sputnik's Impact on America]."&lt;/ref&gt; the first living creature in orbit (a [[dog]] named [[Laika]], November 1957, [[Sputnik 2]]); the first man in space and in orbit ([[Yuri Gagarin]], April 1961, [[Vostok 1]]); the first woman in space ([[Valentina Tereshkova]], June 1963, [[Vostok 6]]); and the first spacewalk (EVA) ([[Alexei Leonov]] in March 1965, [[Voskhod 2]]).

However, most of the Soviet gains listed above were matched by the United States within a year, and sometimes within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful [[space rendezvous]]), which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by the Soviets are not as impressive as they seem; that a number of these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, ''e.g.'', the first woman in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/techsoviet.html |title=Clavius: Technology – beating the soviets |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/2013/06/17/women-in-space-part-one-female-firsts-in-flight-for-space-exploration-and-research/ |title=Women in Space Part One, Female Firsts in Flight for Space Exploration and Research |last=Warren |first=Liz |date=June 17, 2013 |work=A Lab Aloft |publisher=NASA Blogs |type=Blog |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by the time of the launch of the first manned Earth-orbiting Apollo flight ([[Apollo 7]]), the USSR had made only nine [[spaceflight]]s (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See [[List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970]], and refer to individual flights for the length of time.)

Moreover, the USSR did not develop a successful rocket capable of a manned lunar mission until the 1980s – their [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] failed on all four launch attempts between 1969 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sovnding.htm |title=Soviet Lunar Landing |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |publisher=Mark Wade |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224200322/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sovnding.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet [[LK (spacecraft)|LK]] lunar lander was tested in unmanned low-Earth-orbit flights three times in 1970 and 1971.

=== Deaths of NASA personnel ===
In a televised program about the moon-landing hoax allegations, [[Fox Entertainment Group]] listed the deaths of ten astronauts and two civilians related to the manned spaceflight program as part of an alleged cover-up.
* [[Theodore Freeman]] (killed ejecting from a [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] which had suffered a [[bird strike]], October 1964)
* [[Elliot See]] and [[Charles Bassett|Charlie Bassett]] ([[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 crash in bad weather]], February 1966)
* [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] (killed in a fire during the "plugs-out test" preceding [[Apollo 1]], January 1967)
* [[Edward Givens|Edward "Ed" Givens]] (killed in a car accident, June 1967)
* [[Clifton Williams|Clifton "C. C." Williams]] (killed ejecting from a T-38, October 1967)
* [[Michael James Adams|Michael J. "Mike" Adams]] (died in an [[North American X-15|X-15]] crash, November 1967. Adams was the only pilot killed during the X-15 flight test program. He was a test pilot, not a NASA astronaut, but had flown the X-15 above 50 miles.)
* [[Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr.]] (killed in an [[F-104 Starfighter|F-104]] crash, December 1967, shortly after being selected as a pilot with the [[United States Air Force]]'s (later cancelled) [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) program.)
* [[Thomas Baron|Thomas Ronald Baron]] ([[North American Aviation]] employee. Baron died in an automobile collision with a train, April 27, 1967, six days after testifying before [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[Olin E. Teague]]'s House Subcommittee on NASA Oversight hearings held following the Apollo 1 fire, after which he was fired). Baron was a quality control inspector who wrote a report critical of the Apollo program and was an outspoken critic of NASA's safety record after the Apollo 1 fire. Baron and his family were killed as their car was struck by a train at a train crossing. The deaths were an accident.&lt;ref name="not_faked"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/~jscotti/NOT_faked/FOX.html |title=Comments on the FOX special on the Hoax |first=Jim | last=Scotti |website=Lunar and Planetary Laboratory |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/barron.html |title=NASA Apollo Mission Apollo-1 – Baron Report |website=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921155820/https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/barron.html |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the above, X-15 pilot Mike Adams and MOL pilot Robert Lawrence, had no connection with the civilian manned space program that oversaw the Apollo missions. All of the deaths listed besides Welch occurred at least 20 months ''before'' Apollo 11 and subsequent flights.

As of November 2018, four of the twelve [[List of Apollo Astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|Apollo astronauts who landed on the Moon]] between 1969 and 1972 are still alive, including Buzz Aldrin. Also, nine of the twelve [[List of Apollo Astronauts#Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing|Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing]] between 1968 and 1972 are still alive, including [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].

The number of deaths within the American astronaut corps during the run-up to Apollo and during the Apollo missions is similar to the number of deaths incurred by the Russians. During the period 1961 to 1972, at least eight Russian serving and former cosmonauts died:
* [[Valentin Bondarenko]] (ground training accident, March 1961)
* [[Grigori Nelyubov]] (suicide, February 1966)
* [[Vladimir Komarov]] (''[[Soyuz 1]]'' accident, April 1967)
* [[Yuri Gagarin]] ([[MiG-15]] crash, March 1968)
* [[Pavel Belyayev]] (complications following surgery, January 1970)
* [[Georgi Dobrovolski]], [[Vladislav Volkov]], and [[Viktor Patsayev]] (''[[Soyuz 11]]'' accident, June 1971)

Additionally, the overall chief of their manned-spaceflight program, [[Sergei Korolev]], died while undergoing surgery in January 1966.

=== NASA response ===
In June 1977, NASA issued a fact sheet responding to recent claims that the Apollo Moon landings had been hoaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/media/2001/lunar_landing.pdf |title=Did U.S. Astronauts Really Land on the Moon |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 14, 2001 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Reissue (June 1977) |format=PDF |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact sheet is particularly blunt and regards the idea of faking the Moon landings to be preposterous and outlandish. NASA refers to the rocks and particles collected from the Moon as being evidence of the program's legitimacy, as they claim that these rocks could not have been formed under conditions on earth. NASA also notes that all of the operations and phases of the Apollo program were closely followed and under the scrutiny of the news media, from liftoff to splashdown. NASA responds to Bill Kaysing's book, ''We Never Went to the Moon'', by identifying one of his claims of fraud regarding the lack of a crater left on the Moon's surface by the landing of the lunar module, and refuting it with facts about the soil and cohesive nature of the surface of the Moon.

The fact sheet was reissued on February 14, 2001, the day before Fox television's broadcast of ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?'' The documentary reinvigorated the public's interest in conspiracy theories and the possibility that the Moon landings were faked, which has provoked NASA to once again defend its name.

=== Alleged Stanley Kubrick involvement ===

Filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] is accused of having produced much of the footage for Apollos 11 and 12, presumably because he had just directed ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', which is partly set on the Moon and featured advanced special effects.&lt;ref name="clydelewis" /&gt; It has been claimed that when ''2001'' was in [[post-production]] in early 1968, NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three Moon landings. The launch and splashdown would be real but the spacecraft would stay in Earth orbit and fake footage broadcast as "live from the Moon." No evidence was offered for this theory, which overlooks many facts. For example, ''2001'' was released before the first Apollo landing and Kubrick's depiction of the Moon's surface differs greatly from its appearance in Apollo video, film, and photography. Movements of astronauts in ''2001'' differs from that of the Apollo astronauts, and does not resemble an environment with 1/6 the gravity of Earth. Several scenes of ''2001'' show billowing of dust as spacecraft landed, something that would not happen in the vacuum environment of the Moon. Kubrick did hire [[Frederick I. Ordway III|Frederick Ordway]] and [[Harry Lange (film designer)|Harry Lange]], both of whom had worked for NASA and major aerospace contractors, to work with him on ''2001''. Kubrick also used some 50&amp;nbsp;mm f/0.7 lenses that were left over from a batch made by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] for NASA. However, Kubrick only got this lens for ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975). The lens was originally a still photo lens and needed changes to be used for motion filming.

The [[mockumentary]] based on this idea, ''[[Dark Side of the Moon (documentary)|Dark Side of the Moon]]'', could have fueled the conspiracy theory. This French mockumentary, directed by William Karel, was originally aired on Arte channel in 2002 with the title ''Opération Lune''. It parodies conspiracy theories with faked interviews, stories of assassinations of Stanley Kubrick's assistants by the CIA, and a variety of conspicuous mistakes, puns, and references to old movie characters, inserted through the film as clues for the viewer. Nevertheless, ''Opération Lune'' is still taken at face value by some conspiracy believers.

An article entitled "Stanley Kubrick and the Moon Hoax" appeared on Usenet in 1995, in the newsgroup "alt.humor.best-of-usenet". One passage – on how Kubrick was supposedly coerced into the conspiracy – reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;NASA further leveraged their position by threatening to publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick's younger brother, Raul, with the [[American Communist Party]]. This would have been an intolerable embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kubrick had no such brother – the article was a spoof, complete with a giveaway sentence describing Kubrick shooting the moonwalk "on location" on the Moon. Nevertheless, the claim was taken up in earnest;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/bibkubrick.html |title=Clavius: Bibliography – the kubrick article |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clyde Lewis used it almost word-for-word,&lt;ref name="clydelewis" /&gt; whereas [[Room 237|Jay Weidner]] gave the brother a more senior status within the party:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one knows how the powers-that-be convinced Kubrick to direct the Apollo landings. Maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way. The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, was the head of the American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weidner |first=Jay |url=http://jayweidner.com/AlchemicalKubrickIIa.html |title=How Stanley Kubrick Faked the Apollo Moon Landings |work=jayweidner.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123205838/http://jayweidner.com/AlchemicalKubrickIIa.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, Weidner posted on his webpage "Secrets of the Shining", where he states that Kubrick's ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) is a veiled confession of his role in the scam project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/luna_apollomissions10.htm |title=Secrets of the Shining |last=Weidner |first=Jay |website=Bibliotecapleyades.net |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|7hRgQ-Qk7u8|Faked Moon Landing Hidden Subliminal Messages in Stanley Kubrick's Movie 'The Shining'}}.

The 2015 movie ''[[Moonwalkers (film)|Moonwalkers]]'' is a fictional account of a CIA agent's claim of Kubrick's involvement.

In December 2015, a video surfaced which allegedly shows Kubrick being interviewed shortly before his 1999 death; the video purportedly shows the director confessing to T. Patrick Murray that the Apollo Moon landings had been faked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/626119/MOON-LANDINGS-FAKE-Shock-video-Stanley-Kubrick-admit-historic-event-HOAX-NASA |title=Moon Landings 'Fake': Shock video shows 'Stanley Kubrick' admit historic event was 'HOAX' |last=Austin |first=Jon |publisher=''[[Daily Express]]'' |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research quickly found, however, that the video was a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/false-stanley-kubrick-faked-moon-landings/ |title=Lie Me to the Moon |last=Evon |first=Dan |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, NASA granted US$15,000 to James Oberg for a commission to write a point-by-point rebuttal of the hoax claims. However, NASA canceled the commission later that year, after complaints that the book would dignify the accusations.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt; Oberg said that he meant to finish the book.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2424927.stm| accessdate=August 26, 2009| title=Nasa pulls Moon hoax book| date=November 8, 2002| first=David| last=Whitehouse|work=BBC News | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, [[Peter Jennings]] said "NASA is going to spend a few thousand dollars trying to prove to some people that the United States did indeed land men on the Moon," and "NASA had been so rattled, [they] hired [somebody] to write a book refuting the conspiracy theorists." Oberg says that belief in the hoax theories is not the fault of the conspiracists, but rather that of teachers and people (including NASA) who should provide information to the public.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt;

=== ''MythBusters'' special ===
{{Main|MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|l1=Mythbusters "NASA Moon Landing" episode}}

An episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'' in August 2008 was dedicated to the Moon landings. The ''MythBusters'' crew tested many of the conspiracists' claims. Some of the testings were done in a NASA training facility. All of the conspiracists' claims examined on the show were labeled as having been "Busted", meaning that the conspiracists' claims were not true.

Moon-landing conspiracists claim that observatories and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] should be able to photograph the landing sites. This implies that the world's major observatories (as well as the Hubble Program) are complicit in the hoax by refusing to take photos of the landing sites. Photos of the Moon have been taken by Hubble, including at least two Apollo landing sites, but the Hubble resolution limits viewing of lunar objects to sizes no smaller than {{convert|60|–|75|yds|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, which is insufficient resolution to see any landing site features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/hubble_moon.html |title=Hubble Shoots The Moon |editor-last=Stoyanova |editor-first=Silvia |date=September 10, 2007 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Space Agency]]'s [[SMART-1]] unmanned probe sent back photos of the landing sites, according to [[Bernard Foing]], Chief Scientist of the ESA Science Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/847-conspiracy-theories-spacecraft-snoops-apollo-moon-sites.html |title=End of Conspiracy Theories?

In 2002, Alex R. Blackwell of the [[University of Hawaii]] pointed out that some photos taken by Apollo astronauts&lt;ref name="apolloclempix" /&gt; while in orbit around the Moon show the landing sites.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published a story in 2002 saying that European astronomers at the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) would use it to view the landing sites. According to the article, Dr. [[Richard Martin West|Richard West]] said that his team would take "a high-resolution image of one of the Apollo landing sites." Marcus Allen, a conspiracist, answered that no photos of hardware on the Moon would convince him that manned landings had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1414144/Worlds-biggest-telescope-to-prove-Americans-really-walked-on-Moon.html |accessdate=August 26, 2009| title=World's biggest telescope to prove Americans really walked on Moon| date=November 24, 2002| first=Robert| last=Matthews| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the VLT is capable of resolving equivalent to the distance between the headlights of a car as seen from the Moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Stee |first=Philippe |title=To Be or Not to Be: Is It All About Spinning? |date=September 20, 2006 |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |location=Garching, Germany |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0635/ |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be able to photograph some features of the landing sites.

The [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) launched their [[SELENE]] Moon orbiter on September 14, 2007 (JST), from [[Tanegashima Space Center]]. SELENE orbited the Moon at about {{convert|100|km}} altitude.

The Apollo program collected {{convert|838|lb|kg|order=flip}} of [[Moon rock]]s during the six manned missions.

Conspiracists argue that [[Marshall Space Flight Center#Directors|Marshall Space Flight Center Director]] [[Wernher von Braun]]'s trip to [[Antarctica]] in 1967 (about two years before the Apollo 11 launch) was to gather [[lunar meteorite]]s to be used as fake Moon rocks.

NASA said that von Braun's mission was "to look into environmental and logistic factors that might relate to the planning of future space missions, and hardware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/yy/y1967.html | title = Marshall Highlights for 1967 | publisher =[[Marshall Space Flight Center]] History Office}} Originally "published in a news release issued in late 1967 by the Marshall Center Public Affairs Office."&lt;/ref&gt; NASA continues to send teams to work in Antarctica to mimic the conditions on other planets.

On the makeup of the Moon rocks, Kaysing asked: "Why was there never a mention of gold, silver, diamonds or other precious metals on the moon? Wasn't this a viable consideration? Why was this fact never discussed [''sic''] in the press or by the astronauts?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Geologists realize that gold and silver deposits on Earth are the result of the action of hydrothermal fluids concentrating the precious metals into veins of ore. Since in 1969 water was believed to be absent on the Moon, no geologist would bother discussing the possibility of finding these on the Moon in any great amount.

{{Main|Third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings#Apollo missions tracked by independent parties|l1=Apollo missions tracked by independent parties}}
Aside from NASA, a number of groups and individuals tracked the Apollo missions as they happened. On later missions, NASA released information to the public explaining where and when the spacecraft could be sighted. Their flight paths were tracked using radar and they were sighted and photographed using telescopes. Also, radio transmissions between the astronauts on the surface and in orbit were independently recorded.

There are subcultures worldwide which advocate the belief that the Moon landings were faked. By 1977 the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] magazine ''[[Back to Godhead]]'' called the landings a hoax, claiming that, since the [[Sun]] is 93,000,000 miles away, and "according to [[Hindu mythology]] the Moon is 800,000 miles farther away than that", the Moon would be nearly 94,000,000 miles away; to travel that span in 91 hours would require a speed of more than a million miles per hour, "a patently impossible feat even by the scientists' calculations."&lt;ref name="Goswami"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Satsvarūpa dāsa Goswami |authorlink=Satsvarupa dasa Goswami |date=May 1977 |title=Man on the Moon: A Case of Mass Brainwashing |url=http://back2godhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/123_1977_12-05.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Back to Godhead]] |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=10–11, 13–14 |issn=0005-3643 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scheaffer|Scheaffer 2011]], p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Oberg]] of [[ABC News]] said that the conspiracy theory is taught in [[Cuba]]n schools and wherever Cuban teachers are sent.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Getting Apollo 11 Right |first=James |last=Oberg |authorlink=James Oberg |url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC2000/abc2000science/oberg2000.html |accessdate=August 13, 2009 |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC |location=New York |date=July 1999|quote=I'm told that this is official dogma still taught in schools in Cuba, plus wherever else Cuban teachers have been sent (such as [[Sandinista]] Nicaragua and Angola). |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402094521/http://abcnews.go.com/ABC2000/abc2000science/oberg2000.html |archivedate=April 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted in the 1970s by the [[United States Information Agency]] in several countries in [[Latin America]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]] found that most respondents were unaware of the Moon landings, many of the others dismissed them as [[propaganda]] or [[science fiction]], and many thought that it had been the [[Russia]]ns that landed on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oberg|Oberg 1982]], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GriotsSambala.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Griots.]]
Circa 1230s-1600s, the '''Mali''' '''Empire''' was created in Western Africa along the Niger River. Often associated with being founded by [[Sunjata Keita]], the history of Mali is extremely based on oral history. The story of the founder of Mali, Sunjata Keita, is largely based on oral history. Oral history may be defined as the preservation and interpretation of historical, cultural or personal experiences by way of a speaker. In Mali, such a speaker can be described as a poet, a storyteller, a praise singer or a musician. A large amount of Mali’s history is transferred via oral historians. Such oral historians in Mali are known as '''griots, Jalis, and Jelis'''. The origins of oral history in Mali may be traced back to the story of Sunjata Keita. Modern-day oral history in Mali has transformed from the history based griots to a more contemporary musical and negotiator based griots. The current state of oral history in Mali has travelled to other realms like popular culture and politics.

==What is a griot?==
One cannot become a [[Griot]]; one must be born into a family of griots to hold that position. Sometimes, a key aspect to signify who is a griot can be found in the last name. Jeliyas are similar to griots but are not born into a griot family. Jeliya described as the "art of the griot" refers to a type of "musical and verbal artist".&lt;ref name=Jeliya&gt;[http://djembefola.com/jeliya.php "Jeliya- The Art of Jeli (Griot)".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920202539/http://djembefola.com/jeliya.php |date=2010-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jelis have an "exclusive right to play the kora".&lt;ref name=Jeliya /&gt; Jelis are similar to griots because they also recount history but the jelis role is to "Sing and recount Mande social and political life".&lt;ref name=Jeliya /&gt; In reference to a griot, griots are only supposed to marry other griots. Like jelis, griots in Mali often use instruments and music to recite history which ultimately renders the history a performance and not just a story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ias.umn.edu/2012/10/11/ryan-skinner/ Ryan Skinner discusses griots (and other matters) in an interview with Peter Shea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral history in the Mali Empire==
In the '''Mali Empire''', an evident example of '''oral history''' is the Sunjata Keita or [[Sundiata Keita]] story. The Sunjata Keita story remains a strong representation of oral history. Because there are a plethora of versions of the Sunjata story, this exemplifies how oral history can change slightly depending on the griot reciting the history. Also, oral history can be traced back to Sunjata because in the story Sunjata’s griots play a major part to his success. Bamba Suso in his version of ''Sunjata'' writes:
{{quotation |
		After that had happened they went into the circumcision shed.
		After they had come out of there,
		It was not long before his father died.
		Sunjata announced, ‘As for myself,
		However extensive my father’s property may be, 
		I want no part of it except the griots.’
		They asked him, ‘Do you want the griots?’
		They said, Leave it; 
		A person who has nothing will not have griots for long.’
		The griots said, ‘Since he has let all his inheritance go, 
		And says that it is only us that he wants,
		We will not abandon him.
		If he does not die, we shall not desert him.’
		The griots were at his side.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, Bamba, and Banna Kanute (1974). ''Sunjata.'' London: Penguin Books, pp. 122-135.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Suso’s story of Sunjata shows how griots often remain within the family lineage. When Sunjata’s father died, like other parts of his father’s estate, Sunjata was able to choose griots from his father’s estate as well. The ''Sunjata'' story shows that in the Mali Empire, noble families needed griots in order to spread family history. Sunjata states, “I want no part of it [father’s property] except the griots”.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunjata’s need for a griot emphasizes how noble families and griots were often seen as undividable. In the Mali Empire, griots were associated with noble families because such families needed oral historians to accompany them in order to tell the history of their life. Emperors and great warriors often had griots and with such griots, oral history in Mali spreads. The oral historians who were “assigned” to or rather “chosen” for a family were set to remain loyal to that family for life. Loyalty was an important quality a griot must have. In Suso’s version of the Sunjata story says: “We [griots] will not abandon him”.&lt;ref&gt;Suso, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mali Empire, the bond between griots and the emperor, warrior-king, or family they served was meant to be a lifelong bond. In ''Sunjata'', Sunjata’s griot, Bala Faaseega Kuyate acted as both the oral historian for Sunjata and his advisor at times. Throughout Suso’s version of ''Sunjata'', '''Bala Faaseega Kuyate''' accompanies Sunjata. Suso writes:
		&lt;poem&gt;"A day will come
		When bush fowls will lay their eggs on the site of your
		deserted town.
		He says here is your gold.’
		When he had done that, Sunjata buried his mother; 
		Then he and Nyakhaleng Juma Suukho,
		And his younger brother,
		And Bala Faaseega Kuyate
		Rose up and went.
		When he and Bala Faaseega Kuyate were on their way,
		They had gone far into the bush,
		And they had been travelling for a long time when Bala said, ‘I
		Am terribly hungry.’
		Sunjata said, ‘Wait here.’
		He went into a clump of thick bush,
		He examined the calf of his leg where there was plenty of flesh
		and he cut some off.
		When he had cut it into thin strips, he cooked it,
		Then he pounded the leaves of a medicinal shrub and then tied up his leg,
		He came back,
		And he said to Bala, ‘Here is some meat’".&lt;ref&gt;Suso, pp. 432-451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
The relationship between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate describes the relationship between oral historians and emperors or aristocrats in the Mali Empire. Sunjata was very protective of Kuyate, in turn; Kuyate was extremely loyal to Sunjata. It is the job of the griots to be loyal to the family or person they “work” for. Griots did not merely work for the nobility, griots in the Mali Empire also worked for villages. Such griots were used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the village.

Not only were griots used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the villages, but oral historians and griots are also an important cultural facet in Mali in terms of language. Because oral history, is exactly as the name describes, a means of passing history verbally, language is also passed on by oral historians.

==Skills of oral historians in modern Mali==
In present-day Mali, oral historians / griots are sometimes seen as “intermediaries” between two parties. Oral historians in modern Mali often act as mediators between those from different political parties. [[Jan Jansen (historian)|Jan Jansen]] in ''The Griot’s Craft: An Essay on Oral Tradition and Diplomacy'' discusses the role and skills of oral historians in modern-day Mali:
{{quotation |
		"‘Being sent’ is a strategy that is used often in Mande.
		It is a way to create a space for negotiation. Griots are
		conscious of their role as intermediaries, a role which 
		necessitates contact with both parties for whom they
		act as negotiators. They deliberately keep the parties
		apart so that they do not encounter each other, unless
		at a reconciliation festivity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Jansen (historian)|Jansen, Jan]] (2000). ''The Griot's Craft: An Essay on Oral Tradition and Diplomacy'', New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He writes about “being sent” as a strategy for modern-day griots. Similarly to griots during the Mali Empire, modern-day griots must also pass messages between different parties. The skill of “being sent” allows for “negotiation” to occur between parties that may not have negotiated without the help of griots. The oral historians understand that their role does not merely rest on capturing and narrating history, but their role goes as far as encompassing negotiator between two different parties with distinct ideals. Oral historians in modern-day Mali provide a source of communication between such parties. Not only do oral historians chronicle history but they also create a means to communicate. Once the “negotiator” / oral historian completes his goal of mediating tensions between the different parties, the parties are able to have a “reconciliation festivity,” the griots position as both a negotiator and historian are exemplified. Throughout Western Africa and Africa as a continent, oral historians act as mediators between conflicting parties. Oral historians are often essential to solve certain problems. Jansen’s work provides a detailed account of other skills that oral historians / griots need in modern-day Mali. Jansen describes a griot’s skills as a means to “master and manipulate the processes of ‘heating’ and ‘cooling down’ social situations”.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the skills that Jansen describes are:
# 	Don’t [initially] let the parties meet
# 	Don’t [initially] allow parties to talk directly to each other
# 	Repetitive talking
# 	Slowing down of negotiations

Because oral historians in modern Mali are often used as negotiators, the above stated skills ease the process of solving problems between the different political parties. Oral historians in modern Mali acting as negotiators do not allow the parties to meet until the problem at hand is solved. The reasoning behind not allowing the parties to initially meet acts as a way to ease the anger members of the conflicting parties may feel toward each other. Jansen writes: “[a member of a conflicting party] must never express his opinions to the person he is in conflict with since this person will die of anger”.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the job of the griot to keep both parties separate to eliminate the chance of this anger occurring. Similarly to the reason why the griot does not allow both parties to meet initially, the griot does not allow both parties to meet as a means to eliminate tensions that can occur if both parties were to meet. The skill of repetitive talking that Jansen lists is used for “serious matters”.&lt;ref name=Jansen44&gt;Jansen, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen writes:
		"Serious matters are not left to only one person to communicate.
		A small group is created in order to communicate the message. 
		The messenger asks a member of the group to transmit a certain
		message to the person to whom the message is directed. The
		message is then transmitted from person to person until it reaches
		its destination."&lt;ref name=Jansen44 /&gt; 

The repetitive talking of oral history transforms the message being passed into a “supra-personal phenomenon” and allows the message to “gain a semblance of authority”.&lt;ref name=Jansen44 /&gt; Likewise, the repetitive nature of oral history transforms messages and creates similar yet slightly different versions of historical events. Jansen describes “slowing down negotiations” as essential to appease both sides of conflicting parties.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen’s presentation of griots in modern Mali as messengers depicts the transformation of oral historians over time. During the Mali Empire, oral historians often were limited to working with a specific family or emperor but in current Mali, oral historians are no longer limited but can act as messengers between various political parties or other groups.

==Modern-day relations between griots and nobles in Mali==
The relationship between griots and nobles may appear to be a difficult one to understand. As seen through the relationship described between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate, the noble and griot relationship is sometimes represented as a partnership. Dr. Barbara G. Hoffman, an associate professor of Anthropology at [[Cleveland State University]], discusses in her book ''Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande'' the relationship between griots and nobles. She writes that “tension is often expressed through nobles’ criticism of griots’ “empty speech” or griots’ disdain for nobles lack of self-knowledge”.&lt;ref name=Hoffman53&gt;Hoffman, Barbara (2000). ''Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande.'' Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; While griots take pride in understanding themselves and life around them, nobles are often more focused on worldly aspects. Despite the relationship that is suggested in ''Sunjata'', the relationship between nobles and griots can be seen as extremely different from that of loyalty and partnership. Hoffman views the relationship between griots and nobles as showing a sharp distinction between castes. Hoffman writes, “This [the caste system] was a central issue for the griots and nobles present at this Kita celebration. They generated social difference and the reinforcement of social boundaries through a repertoire of strategies for recreating old social structures as well as for creating new ones”.&lt;ref name=Hoffman53 /&gt; In modern Mali, griots are often seen as being a part of a lower caste then nobles despite the help and history they provide to nobles and society. In Hoffman's work addresses the position of oral historians in  castes "Mande-style".&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman writes, "Living up to one's caste ideals is a source of pride in Mande; violating them a cause for disgrace." The position of griots in the Mande caste system was that of extremely lower stature then the nobles griots and oral historians have a tendency to work for. Oral historians molded their way into the caste system and although they are of a lower caste then nobles, they are extremely influential in Mali. In ''Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande'', David C. Conrad also discusses the relationship between nobles and griots, writing: "Another revealing aspect of the relationship between nobles and griots is the asymmetry of their mutual accountability. For example, nobles almost never blame individual griots for the general character of the group".&lt;ref name=Conrad29&gt;Conrad, David C. (1995). '' Status and Identity in West Africa: Nyamakalaw of Mande.'' Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad then goes on to describe how griots "openly criticize nobles in public as well as in private".&lt;ref name=Conrad29 /&gt; Although griots are seen as being inferior to nobles, griots have no issue criticizing the faults of the family they work for. Such a willingness to criticize emphasizes the fact that griots do have in Mali despite their position in the caste system. Also included in Conrad's book is Cherif Keita's essay "Jaliya in the Modern World: A Tribute to Banzumana Sissoko and Massa Makan Diabate", in which Cherif Keita presents a "tribute to contemporary bards".&lt;ref name=Conrad16&gt;Conrad, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Keita praises the griots and claims that griots "have contributed positively to toward the building of a modern nation-state".&lt;ref name=Conrad16 /&gt; Contrary to beliefs that griots were seen as a part of a lower class, Keita presents an "aristocratic view of contemporary griots".&lt;ref name=Conrad16 /&gt; Keita's perspective on griots provides a different outlook on the position of griots in modern Mali. Although griots are looked at as being a part of a low caste, griots have added to cultural and historical modern Mali society.

==Popular modern-day griots in Mali==
In modern-day Mali, griots are often singers or musicians. For example, [[Abdoulaye Diabaté]], a singer from Mali, was born into a family of griots in 1956. Diabaté has a plethora of experience in contemporary and popular music. [[Baba Sissoko]] is also considered a Malian griot because he was born into a family of griots. Another griot from Mali, [[Toumani Diabaté]], also has a plethora of experience in other forms of performing. Toumani Diabaté has experience in flamenco, blues and jazz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12212">The '''phantom time hypothesis''' is a historical [[conspiracy theory]] asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, it hypothesizes a conspiracy by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III]], [[Pope Sylvester II]], and possibly the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII]], to fabricate the [[Anno Domini]] dating system retrospectively, in order to place them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Ulrich Niemitz, [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/Niemitz-1997.pdf ''Did the Early Middle Ages Really Exist?''] pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.&lt;ref name="fomenko1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly | year = 2007 | publisher = Mithec | isbn = 2-913621-07-4 | title = History: Chronology 1: Second Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this scenario, the entire [[Carolingian period]], including the figure of [[Charlemagne]], is a fabrication, with a "phantom time" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The proposal has been universally rejected by mainstream historians.

== Heribert Illig ==
Illig was born in 1947 in [[Vohenstrauß]], [[Bavaria]].
He was active in an association dedicated to [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[catastrophism]] and [[historical revisionism]],
''Gesellschaft zur Rekonstruktion der Menschheits- und Naturgeschichte''.
From 1989 to 1994 he acted as editor of the journal ''Vorzeit-Frühzeit-Gegenwart''.
Since 1995, he has worked as a publisher and author under his own publishing company, ''Mantis-Verlag'', and publishing his own journal, ''Zeitensprünge''.
Outside of his publications related to revised chronology, he has edited the works of [[Egon Friedell]].

Before focusing on the early medieval period, Illig published various proposals for revised chronologies of prehistory and of Ancient Egypt.
His proposals received prominent coverage in German popular media in the 1990s. His 1996 ''Das erfundene Mittelalter'' also received scholarly recensions, but was universally rejected as fundamentally flawed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Fried: ''Wissenschaft und Phantasie. Das Beispiel der Geschichte'', in: Historische Zeitschrift Band 263,2/1996, 291–316.
Matthias Grässlin, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 1. Oktober 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the journal ''Ethik und Sozialwissenschaften'' offered a platform for critical discussion to Illig's proposal, with a number of historians commenting on its various aspects.&lt;ref&gt;EuS 1997 Heft 4.
Theo Kölzer (Bonn University) refused to contribute, and the journal printed his letter of refusal instead in which Kölzer criticizes the journal for lending credibility to Illig's "abstruse" idea.
A favourable review was published by sociologist Gunnar Heinsohn, which later led to a collaboration between Illig and Heinsohn until 2011, when Heinsohn left the board of editors of Illig's journal and published his rejection of Illig's core idea that the figure of Charlemagne is a high medieval fiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1997, there has been little scholarly reception of Illig's ideas, although they continued to be discussed as [[pseudohistory]] in German popular media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Borgolte]]. In: [[Der Tagesspiegel]] vom 29. Juni 1999. Stephan Matthiesen: ''[http://www.stephan-matthiesen.de/de/texte/archaeologie-geschichte/erfundenes-mittelalter-illig.html Erfundenes Mittelalter – fruchtlose These!]'', in: Skeptiker 2/2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Illig continued to publish on the "phantom time hypothesis" until at least 2013.
Also in 2013, he published on an unrelated topic of [[art history]], on [[German Renaissance]] master [[Anton Pilgram]], but again proposing revisions to conventional chronology, and arguing for the abolition of the art historical category of [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Anton, gen. Pilgram, oder Abschied vom Manierismus'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal ==
The bases of Illig's hypothesis include:&lt;ref name="Illig 1"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Wer hat an der Uhr gedreht? |isbn=3-548-75064-8 | publisher = Econ Verlag | year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illig 2"&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Heribert | last = Illig
 | title = Das erfundene Mittelalter |isbn=3-548-36429-2 | publisher = | year =
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scarcity of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence that can be reliably dated to the period AD 614–911, the perceived inadequacies of radiometric and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] methods of dating this period, and the over-reliance of medieval historians on written sources.
* The presence of [[Romanesque architecture]] in tenth-century Western Europe, suggesting the Roman era was not as long ago as conventionally thought.
* The relation between the [[Julian calendar]], [[Gregorian calendar]] and the underlying astronomical [[tropical year|solar or tropical year]]. The Julian calendar, introduced by [[Julius Caesar]], was long known to introduce a discrepancy from the tropical year of around one day for each century that the calendar was in use. By the time the Gregorian calendar was introduced in AD 1582, Illig alleges that the old Julian calendar should have produced a discrepancy of thirteen days between it and the real (or tropical) calendar. Instead, the astronomers and mathematicians working for [[Pope Gregory XIII]] had found that the civil calendar needed to be adjusted by only ten days. (The Julian calendar day Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by the first day of the Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October 1582). From this, Illig concludes that the [[Anno Domini|AD]] era had counted roughly three centuries which never existed.

== Criticism ==
* The most difficult challenge to the theory is through observations in [[Archaeoastronomy|ancient astronomy]], especially those of [[solar eclipse]]s cited by European sources prior to 600 AD (when phantom time would have distorted the chronology). Besides several others that are perhaps too vague to disprove the phantom time hypothesis, two in particular are dated with enough precision to disprove the hypothesis with a high degree of certainty. One is reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] in 59 AD&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder.

In addition, observations during the [[Tang dynasty]] in China, and [[Halley's Comet]], for example, are consistent with current astronomy with no "phantom time" added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|surname1=Dieter Herrmann|periodical=Beiträge zur Astronomiegeschichte&amp;nbsp;3|title=Nochmals: Gab es eine Phantomzeit in unserer Geschichte? |year=2000|at=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–14|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutch|first=Stephen|title=Is a Chunk of History Missing?|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/Phantom%20Time.HTM|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Gregorian reform was never purported to bring the calendar in line with the Julian calendar as it had existed at the time of its institution in 45 BC, but as it had existed in 325, the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], which had established a method for [[Computus|determining the date]] of [[Easter Sunday]] by fixing the [[vernal equinox]] on March 21 in the Julian calendar. By 1582, the astronomical equinox was occurring on March 10 in the Julian calendar, but Easter was still being calculated from a nominal equinox on March 21. In 45 BC the astronomical vernal equinox took place around March 23. Illig's "three missing centuries" thus correspond to the 369 years between the institution of the Julian calendar in 45 BC, and the fixing of the Easter Date at the Council of Nicaea in AD 325.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mütz: ''Die „Phantomzeit“ 614 bis 911 von Heribert Illig.

* If [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] were fabricated, there would have to be a corresponding fabrication of the history of the rest of Europe, including [[Anglo-Saxon England]], the [[History of the papacy|Papacy]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The "phantom time" period also encompasses the life of [[Muhammad]] and the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] into the areas of the former Roman Empire, including the conquest of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Iberia]]. This history too would have to be forged or drastically misdated. It would also have to be reconciled with the history of the [[Tang dynasty]] of China and its contact with Islam, such as at the [[Battle of Talas]].&lt;ref name="Dutch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did the Middle Ages Not Really Happen?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2992/did-the-middle-ages-not-really-happen|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63551">{{short description|The Americans prior to European influences}}The '''Pre-Columbian era''' incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|period subdivisions]] in the [[history of the Americas|history and prehistory of the Americas]] before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continent, spanning the time of the [[migration to the New World|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[Early Modern period]].

While the phrase "pre-Columbian era" literally refers only to the time preceding [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages of 1492, in practice the phrase is usually used to denote the entire history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americas cultures]] until those cultures were exterminated, diminished, or extensively altered by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's first landing. For this reason the alternative terms of '''Precontact Americas''', '''Pre-Colonial Americas''' or '''Prehistoric Americas''' are also in use. In areas of [[Latin America]] the term usually used is '''Pre-Hispanic'''.

Many pre-Columbian [[civilization]]s established hallmarks which included permanent settlements, cities, [[agriculture]], civic and [[monument]]al [[architecture]], major [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]], and [[Complex society|complex societal hierarchies]]. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European colonies and the arrival of enslaved Africans (c. late 16th–early 17th centuries),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tripline.net/trip/Early_European_Settlements_in_North_America-066434737501100388EFEC49781BFFB4|title=Early European Settlements in North America|work=Tripline|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are known only through [[archaeology of the Americas|archaeological investigations]] and [[oral history]]. Other civilizations were contemporary with the colonial period and were described in European historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the [[Maya civilization]], had their own written records. Because many Christian Europeans of the time viewed such texts as [[heresy|heretical]], men like [[Diego de Landa]] destroyed many texts in pyres, even while seeking to preserve native histories. Only a few hidden documents have survived in their original languages, while others were transcribed or dictated into Spanish, giving modern historians glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.

Indigenous American cultures continue to evolve after the pre-Columbian era. Many of these peoples and their descendants continue traditional practices while evolving and adapting new cultural practices and technologies into their lives.

==History==
{{Human history}}Before the development of archaeology in the 19th century, historians of the pre-Columbian period mainly interpreted the records of the European conquerors and the accounts of early European travelers and antiquaries. It was not until the nineteenth century that the work of men such as [[John Lloyd Stephens]], [[Eduard Seler]] and [[Alfred P. Maudslay]], and of institutions such as the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] of [[Harvard University]], led to the reconsideration and criticism of the European sources. Now, the scholarly study of pre-Columbian cultures is most often based on scientific and multidisciplinary methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ignition |last=Bernal |title=A History of Mexican Archaeology: The Vanished Civilizations of Middle America |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |date=1980 |isbn=978-0-5007-8008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement of the Americas===
{{main article|Settlement of the Americas|Paleo-Indians}}
{{further|Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}

Asian nomads are thought to have entered the [[Americas]] via the [[Bering Land Bridge]] (Beringia), now the [[Bering Strait]] and possibly along the coast. Genetic evidence found in [[Amerindian]]s' maternally inherited [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) supports the theory of multiple genetic populations migrating from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberwest.com/cw09/v9scwst1.html |title=Study confirms Bering land bridge flooded later than previously believed |work=Cyberwest |date=July 31, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/bering.htm |title=Bering Land Bridge National Preserve |publisher=National Park System}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of millennia, [[Paleo-Indians]] spread throughout North and South America. Exactly when the first group of people migrated into the Americas is the subject of much debate. One of the earliest identifiable cultures was the [[Clovis culture]], with sites dating from some 13,000 years ago. However, older sites dating back to 20,000 years ago have been claimed. Some [[Indigenous Amerindian genetics|genetic]] studies estimate the colonization of the Americas dates from between 40,000 and 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="SpencerWells2"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Spencer |last1=Wells |first2=Mark |last2=Read |title=The Journey of Man - A Genetic Odyssey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAsKm-_zu5sC&amp;pg=PA138 |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-8129-7146-9 |year=2002 |pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The chronology of migration models is currently divided into two general approaches. The first is the ''short chronology theory'' with the first movement beyond [[Alaska]] into the [[New World|Americas]] occurring no earlier than 14,000–17,000 years ago, followed by successive waves of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stefan |last=Lovgren |title=Americas Settled 15,000 Years Ago, Study Says |work=National Geographic News |date=March 13, 2008 |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080313-first-americans.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dnaa"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_701509129___0/First_Americans.html |title=First Americans |work= Encarta Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Microsoft |first=David J. |last=Meltzer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx7zKJiO?url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_701509129___0/First_Americans.html |archivedate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.11.013 |last1=Fagundes |first1=Nelson J.R. |first2=Ricardo |last2=Kanitz |first3=Roberta |last3=Eckert |first4=Ana C.S. |last4=Valls |first5=Mauricio R. |last5=Bogo |first6=Francisco M. |last6=Salzano |first7=David Glenn |last7=Smith |first8=Wilson A. |last8=Silva |first9=Marco A. |last9=Zago |first10=Andrea K. |last10=Ribeiro-dos-Santos |first11=Sidney E.B. |last11=Santos |first12=Maria Luiza |last12=Petzl-Erler |first13=Sandro L. |last13=Bonatto |display-authors=3 |title=Mitochondrial Population Genomics Supports a Single Pre-Clovis Origin with a Coastal Route for the Peopling of the Americas |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=82 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=583–592 |pmid=18313026 |pmc=2427228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Paul Robert |editor-last=Magocsi |title=Beginnings to 1500 C.E. |work=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples |publisher=Multicultural History Society of Ontario |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-8020-2938-6 |url=http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/p4/1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206163225/http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/p4/1 |archivedate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second belief is the ''long chronology theory'', which proposes that the first group of people entered the hemisphere at a much earlier date, possibly 50,000–40,000 years ago or earlier.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web |title=Atlas of the Human Journey |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501094643/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-01 |work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marder|first=William|title=Indians in the Americas: The Untold Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Obgdz8auwkMC&amp;pg=PA11|year=2005|publisher=Book Tree|isbn=978-1-58509-104-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/ |title=Journey of mankind |work=BradShaw Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Vaughn M., Jr. |last=Bryant |title=Pre-Clovis |editor-last=Gibbon |editor-first=Guy E. |work=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0u2y_SVnmoC&amp;pg=PA682 |year=1998 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8153-0725-9 |pages=682-683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts have been found in both North and South America which have been [[carbon dating|dated]] to 14,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilford |first=John Noble |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/science/04fossil.html |title=Evidence Supports Earlier Date for People in North America |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accordingly humans have been proposed to have reached [[Cape Horn]] at the southern tip of South America by this time. In that case, the [[Inuit|Eskimo peoples]] would have arrived separately and at a much later date, probably no more than 2,000 years ago, moving across the ice from [[Siberia]] into Alaska.

]]The North American climate was unstable as the ice age receded. It finally stabilized by about 10,000 years ago; climatic conditions were then very similar to today's.&lt;ref name="icaage"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Imbrie|first1=John|last2=Imbrie|first2=Katherine Palmer|title=Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIxRp9fRDGwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=1979|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this time frame, roughly pertaining to the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]], numerous [[archaeological culture]]s have been identified.

The unstable climate led to widespread migration, with early [[Paleo-Indian]]s soon spreading throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2002).{{full|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paleo-Indians were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, likely characterized by small, mobile bands consisting of approximately 20 to 50 members of an extended family. These groups moved from place to place as preferred resources were depleted and new supplies were sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/281017 |last=Kelly |first=Robert L. |first2=Lawrence C. |last2=Todd |title=Coming into the Country: Early Paleo-Indian Hunting and Mobility |jstor=281017 |journal=[[American Antiquity]] |volume=53 |issue=2 |year=1988 |pages=231–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During much of the Paleo-Indian period, bands are thought to have subsisted primarily through hunting now-extinct [[megafauna|giant land animals]] such as [[mastodon]] and [[bison antiquus|ancient bison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breitburg |first1=Emanual |first2=John B. |last2=Broster |first3=Arthur L. |last3=Reesman |first4=Richard G. |last4=Stearns  |title=Coats-Hines Site: Tennessee's First Paleo-Indian Mastodon Association |journal=Current Research in the Pleistocene |volume=13 |year=1996 |pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleo-Indian groups carried a variety of tools. These included distinctive projectile points and knives, as well as less distinctive implements used for butchering and hide processing.

The vastness of the North American continent, and the variety of its climates, [[ecology]], [[vegetation]], [[fauna]], and landforms, led ancient peoples to coalesce into many distinct [[linguistics|linguistic]] and cultural groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fagan|first1=Dr. Brian|last2=Durrani|first2=Nadia|title=People of the Earth: An Introduction to World Prehistory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8lwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|edition=fourteenth|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34682-1}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the oral histories of the indigenous peoples, described by a wide range of traditional [[creation stories]] which often say that a given people have been living in a certain territory since the creation of the world.

Over the course of thousands of years, paleo-Indian people domesticated, bred and cultivated a number of plant species. These species were very nutritious, and they now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/agriculture-forestry-fishing-hunting/331083-1.html |title=Native Americans: The First Farmers |work=AgExporter |date=October 1, 1999 |publisher=Allbusiness.com |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Arctic, Subarctic, and coastal peoples continued to live as hunters and gatherers, while agriculture was adopted in more temperate and sheltered regions. But wherever it was adopted, [[plant cultivation]] permitted a dramatic rise in population.&lt;ref name="icaage"/&gt;

=====Middle Archaic period=====
[[File:PreColumbian American cultures.png|thumb|Major cultural areas of the pre-Columbian Americas: {{legend0|#4747a1|Arctic}} {{legend0|#50828e|Northwest}} {{legend0|#40895d|Aridoamerica}} {{legend0|#b4581b|Mesoamerica}} {{legend0|#548434|Isthmo-Colombian}} {{legend0|#b1c759|Caribbean}} {{legend0|#b94343|Amazon}} {{legend0|#8b782a|Andes}}]]After the migration or migrations, it was several thousand years before the first complex societies arose, the earliest emerging about seven to eight thousand years ago.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} As early as 6500 BCE, people in the Lower Mississippi Valley at the [[Monte Sano (mound complex)|Monte Sano]] site were building complex [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]]s, probably for religious purposes. This is the earliest dated of numerous mound complexes found in present-day [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Florida]]. Since the late twentieth century, archeologists have explored and dated these sites.  They have found that they were built by [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, whose people occupied the sites on a seasonal basis, and who had not yet developed ceramics. [[Watson Brake]], a large complex of eleven platform mounds, was constructed beginning in 3400 BCE and added to over 500 years. This has changed earlier assumptions that complex construction arose only after societies had adopted agriculture, become sedentary, often developed stratified hierarchy, and generally also developed ceramics. These ancient people had organized to build complex mound projects from a different basis.

=====Late Archaic period=====
[[File:Poverty Point Aerial HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Poverty Point]], 1500 BCE]]
Until the accurate dating of [[Watson Brake]] and similar sites, the oldest mound complex was thought to be [[Poverty Point]], also located in the [[Lower Mississippi Valley]]. Built about 1500 BCE, it is the centerpiece of a culture extending over 100 sites on both sides of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. The Poverty Point site has earthworks in the form of six concentric half-circles, divided by radial aisles, together with some mounds. The entire complex is nearly a mile across.

Mound building was continued by succeeding cultures, who built numerous sites in the middle Mississippi and [[Ohio River]] valleys as well, adding [[effigy mounds]], conical and ridge mounds and other shapes.

====Woodland period====
{{Main article|Woodland period}}
[[File:Mound City Chillicothe Ohio HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Hopewell mounds from the [[Hopewell Culture National Historical Park|Mound City Group]] in Ohio]]
The [[Woodland period]] of North American pre-Columbian cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000 [[Common Era|BCE]] to 1000 CE in the eastern part of North America. The term "Woodland" was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites between the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] and the [[Mississippian culture]]s. The [[Adena culture]] and the ensuing [[Hopewell tradition]] during this period built monumental earthwork architecture and established continent-spanning trade and exchange networks.

This period is considered a developmental stage without any massive changes in a short period, but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools, leather working, textile manufacture, tool production, cultivation, and shelter construction. Some Woodland peoples continued to use spears and [[atlatl]]s until the end of the period, when they were replaced by [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]].

====Mississippian culture====
{{Main article|Mississippian Culture}}
[[File:Cahokia Aerial HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Cahokia]], the largest Mississippian culture site]]
The Mississippian culture was spread across the Southeast and Midwest from the Atlantic coast to the edge of the plains, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Upper Midwest, although most intensively in the area along the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. One of the distinguishing features of this culture was the construction of complexes of large earthen [[Platform mound|mounds]] and grand plazas, continuing the [[mound builder (people)|moundbuilding]] traditions of earlier cultures. They grew [[maize]] and other crops intensively, participated in an extensive trade network and had a complex stratified society.  The Mississippians first appeared around 1000 CE, following and developing out of the less agriculturally intensive and less centralized Woodland period. The largest urban site of this people, [[Cahokia]]—located near modern [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]—may have reached a population of over 20,000.  Other chiefdoms were constructed throughout the Southeast, and its trade networks reached to the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia was the most populous city in North America. (Larger cities did exist in Mesoamerica and South America.) [[Monk's Mound]], the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric [[New World|Americas]]. The culture reached its peak in about 1200–1400 CE, and in most places, it seems to have been in decline before the arrival of Europeans.

Many [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|Mississippian peoples]] were encountered by the expedition of [[Hernando de Soto]] in the 1540s, mostly with disastrous results for both sides. Unlike the Spanish expeditions in Mesoamerica, who conquered vast empires with relatively few men, the de Soto expedition wandered the American Southeast for four years, becoming more bedraggled, losing more men and equipment, and eventually arriving in [[Mexico]] as a fraction of its original size. The local people fared much worse though, as the fatalities of diseases introduced by the expedition devastated the populations and produced much social disruption. By the time Europeans returned a hundred years later, nearly all of the Mississippian groups had vanished, and vast swaths of their territory were virtually uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=Charles M.|authorlink=Charles M.

====Historic tribes====
[[File:Nordamerikanische Kulturareale en.png|thumb|Cultural areas of pre-Columbian North America|alt=]]When the Europeans arrived, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples of North America]] had a wide range of lifeways from sedentary, agrarian societies to semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Many formed new [[tribe]]s or confederations in response to European colonization. These are often classified by [[cultural region]]s, loosely based on geography. These can include the following:
* [[Circumpolar peoples|Arctic]], including [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Inuit]], and [[Yupik peoples]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic|Subarctic]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains|Great Plains]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|Great Basin]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Northwest Plateau]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of California|California]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southwest|Southwest]] ([[Oasisamerica]])

Numerous pre-Columbian societies were sedentary, such as the [[Pueblo peoples]], [[Mandan]], [[Hidatsa]] and others, and some established large settlements, even cities, such as [[Cahokia]], in what is now [[Illinois]]. The [[Iroquois]] League of Nations or "People of the Long House" was a politically advanced, democratic society, which is thought by some historians to have influenced the [[United States Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Effect of the Iroquois Constitution on the United States Constitution |first=Janet L. |last=Daly |url=http://www.ipoaa.com/iroquois_constitution_united_states.htm |work=IPOAA Magazine  |year=1997 |archive-date=July 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.ipoaa.com/iroquois_constitution_united_states.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Thomas E.|title=33 Questions about American History You're Not Supposed to Ask|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCMcnBRKR-0C&amp;pg=PA62|year=2007|publisher=Crown Forum|isbn=978-0-307-34668-1|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[United States Senate|Senate]] passing a resolution to this effect in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/hconres331.pdf |title=H.

===Mesoamerica===
{{further|Mesoamerican chronology}}
[[File:Yaxchilan 1.jpg|thumb|One of the pyramids in the upper level of [[Yaxchilán]]|alt=|left]][[Mesoamerica]] is the region extending from central Mexico south to the northwestern border of [[Costa Rica]] that gave rise to a group of stratified, culturally related agrarian civilizations spanning an approximately 3,000-year period before the visits to the Caribbean by Christopher Columbus. ''Mesoamerican'' is the adjective generally used to refer to that group of pre-Columbian cultures. This refers to an environmental area occupied by an assortment of ancient cultures that shared religious beliefs, art, architecture, and technology in the Americas for more than three thousand years.
Between 2000 and 300 BCE, complex cultures began to form in Mesoamerica. Some matured into advanced pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations such as the [[Olmec]], [[Teotihuacan]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], [[Tarascan state|Purepecha]], [[Toltec]], and [[Mexica]]/[[Aztec]]s. The Mexica civilization is also known as the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]], since they were three smaller kingdoms loosely united together.&lt;ref name=1491Book&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C. Mann |title=[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]] |orig-year=2005 |year=2006 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=1-4000-3205-9 |pages=199–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|Atlantes at [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]|alt=|left]]

These indigenous civilizations are credited with many inventions: building [[pyramid]]-temples, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], medicine, writing, highly accurate [[calendar]]s, [[Native American art|fine arts]], intensive agriculture, [[engineering]], an [[abacus]] calculator, and complex [[theology]]. They also invented the wheel, but it was used solely as a toy. In addition, they used native [[copper]], [[silver]] and [[gold]] for metalworking.

Archaic inscriptions on rocks and rock walls all over northern Mexico (especially in the state of [[Nuevo León]]) demonstrate an early propensity for counting. Their number system was [[base 20]] and included [[zero]]. These early count-markings were associated with astronomical events and underscore the influence that astronomical activities had upon Mesoamerican people before the arrival of Europeans. Many of the later Mesoamerican civilizations carefully built their cities and ceremonial centers according to specific astronomical events.

The biggest Mesoamerican cities, such as [[Teotihuacan]], [[Tenochtitlan]], and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], were among the largest in the world. These cities grew as centers of commerce, ideas, ceremonies, and theology, and they radiated influence outwards onto neighboring cultures in central Mexico.

While many city-states, kingdoms, and empires competed with one another for power and prestige, Mesoamerica can be said to have had five major civilizations: the Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Toltec, the Mexica and the Maya. These civilizations (with the exception of the politically fragmented Maya) extended their reach across Mesoamerica—and beyond—like no others. They consolidated power and distributed influence in matters of trade, art, politics, technology, and theology. Other regional power players made economic and political alliances with these civilizations over the span of 4,000 years. Many made war with them, but almost all peoples found themselves within one of their spheres of influence.

[[Regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica]] have been the subject of considerable research. There is evidence of trade routes starting as far north as the [[Mexican Plateau|Mexico Central Plateau]], and going down to the Pacific coast. These trade routes and cultural contacts then went on as far as [[Central America]]. These networks operated with various interruptions from pre-Olmec times and up to the Late Classical Period (600–900 CE).

====Olmec civilization====
{{Main article|Olmec}}
The earliest known civilization is the Olmec. This civilization established the cultural blueprint by which all succeeding indigenous civilizations would follow in Mexico. Pre-Olmec civilization began with the production of pottery in abundance, around 2300 BCE in the [[Grijalva River]] delta. Between 1600 and 1500 BCE, the Olmec civilization had begun, with the consolidation of power at their capital, a site today known as [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] near the coast in southeast [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name=OLMECS&gt;{{cite book|title=The Olmecs: America's First Civilization|authorlink= Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-500-28503-9|pages=9–25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXd-QgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olmec influence extended across Mexico, into [[Central America]], and along the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. They transformed many peoples' thinking toward a new way of government, pyramid-temples, writing, astronomy, art, mathematics, economics, and religion. Their achievements paved the way for the Maya civilization and the civilizations in central Mexico.

====Teotihuacan civilization====
{{Main article|Teotihuacan}}
The decline of the Olmec resulted in a power vacuum in Mexico. Emerging from that vacuum was Teotihuacan, first settled in 300 BCE. By 150 CE, Teotihuacan had risen to become the first true [[metropolis]] of what is now called North America. Teotihuacan established a new economic and political order never before seen in Mexico. Its influence stretched across Mexico into Central America, founding new dynasties in the Maya cities of [[Tikal]], [[Copan]], and [[Kaminaljuyú]].  Teotihuacan's influence over the Maya civilization cannot be overstated: it transformed political power, artistic depictions, and the nature of economics. Within the city of Teotihuacan was a diverse and cosmopolitan population. Most of the regional ethnicities of Mexico were represented in the city, such as [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]] from the Oaxaca region. They lived in apartment communities where they worked their trades and contributed to the city's economic and cultural prowess.  Teotihuacan's economic pull impacted areas in northern Mexico as well. It was a city whose monumental architecture reflected a monumental new era in Mexican civilization, declining in political power about 650 CE—but lasting in cultural influence for the better part of a millennium, to around 950 CE.
[[File:Uxmal-mexico.jpg|thumb|Maya architecture at [[Uxmal]]]]

====Tarascan/Purepecha Civilization====
{{Main article|Tarascan State}} 
Initially, the lands that would someday comprise the lands of the powerful Tarascan Empire was inhabited by several independent communities. Around 1300, however, the first Cazonci, Tariacuri, united these communities and built them into one of the most advanced civilizations in Mesoamerica. Their capital at Tzintzuntzan was just one of the many cities--there were ninety more under its control. The Tarascan Empire was among the largest in Central America, so it is no surprise that they routinely came into conflict with the neighboring [[Aztec Empire]]. 
Out of all the civilizations in its area, the Tarascan Empire was the most prominent in metallurgy, harnessing copper, silver, and gold to create items such as tools, decorations, and even weapons and armor. Bronze was also used. 
The great victories over the Aztecs by the Tarascans cannot be understated. Nearly every war they fought in resulted in a Tarascan victory. 
Because the Tarascan Empire had little links to the former [[Toltec Empire]], they were also quite independent in culture from their neighbors. The Aztecs, [[Confederacy of Tlaxcala| Tlaxcalans]], Olmec, Mixtec, Maya, and others were very similar to each other, however. This is because they were all directly preceded by the Toltecs, and they therefore shared almost identical cultures. The Tarascans, however, possessed a unique religion, as well as other things.  

====Maya civilization====
{{Main article|Maya civilization}}
Contemporary with Teotihuacan's greatness was that of the Maya civilization. The period between 250 CE and 650 CE was a time of intense flourishing of Maya civilized accomplishments. While the many Maya city-states never achieved political unity on the order of the central Mexican civilizations, they exerted a tremendous intellectual influence upon Mexico and Central America. The Maya built some of the most elaborate cities on the continent, and made innovations in mathematics, astronomy, and calendrics. The Mayans also evolved the only true writing system native to the Americas using pictographs and syllabic elements in the form of [[text (literary theory)|texts]] and [[codex|codices]] inscribed on stone, pottery, wood, or highly perishable books made from bark paper.

====Aztec/Mexica/Triple Alliance civilization====
{{Main article|Aztec}}
With the decline of the [[Toltec]] civilization came political fragmentation in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Into this new political game of contenders to the Toltec throne stepped outsiders: the [[Mexica]]. They were also a desert people, one of seven groups who formerly called themselves "Azteca", in memory of [[Aztlán]], but they changed their name after years of migrating. Since they were not from the Valley of Mexico, they were initially seen as crude and unrefined in the ways of [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] civilization. Through political maneuvers and ferocious fighting skills, they managed to become the rulers of Mexico as the head of the 'Triple Alliance' (which included two other "Aztec" cities, Texcoco and Tlacopan).

Latecomers to Mexico's central [[plateau]], the Mexica thought of themselves, nevertheless, as heirs of the civilizations that had preceded them. For them, arts, sculpture, architecture, engraving, feather-mosaic work, and the calendar, were bequest from the former inhabitants of Tula, the Toltecs.

The Mexica-Aztecs were the rulers of much of central Mexico by about 1400 (while Yaquis, Coras and Apaches commanded sizable regions of northern desert), having subjugated most of the other regional states by the 1470s.  At their peak, 300,000 Mexica{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} presided over a wealthy tribute-empire variously estimated at 5–8 million people in total a population of 8–12 millions. The actual population is never more than an estimate. The modern name "Mexico" comes from their name.

Their capital, [[Tenochtitlan]], is the site of modern-day capital of Mexico, [[Mexico City]].  At its peak, it was one of the largest cities in the world with population estimates of 200–300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Conquistador: Hernán Cortés, King Montezuma, and the last stand of the Aztecs |last=Levy |first=Buddy |date=2008 |publisher=Bantam Books Trade Paperbacks |isbn=9780553384710 |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSfO7xFo3BIC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The market established there was the largest ever seen by the [[conquistador]]s on arrival.

=== South America ===

{{see also|Andean civilizations}}
[[File:Fazenda Colorada.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Geoglyphs on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest]]
By the first millennium, South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains, and coasts were the home of millions of people. Estimates vary, but 30–50 million are often given and 100 million by some estimates. Some groups formed permanent settlements. Among those groups were [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]-speaking peoples ("[[Muisca people|Muisca]]" or "Muysca"), Valdivia, [[Quimbaya culture|Quimbaya]], [[Calima culture|Calima]] and the [[Tairona]]. The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] of [[Colombia]], postdating the [[Herrera Period]], [[Valdivia culture|Valdivia]] of [[Ecuador]], the [[Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]  of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] were the four most important sedentary Amerindian groups in South America. From the 1970s, numerous [[geoglyph]]s have been discovered on deforested land in the [[Amazon rainforest]], [[Brazil]], supporting Spanish accounts of a complex, possibly ancient Amazonian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/americas/land-carvings-attest-to-amazons-lost-world.html |title=Once Hidden by Forest, Carvings in Land Attest to Amazon's Lost World |first=Simon |last=Romero |work=The New York Times |date=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |date=December 2009 |volume=83 |issue=322 |pages=1084–1095 |title=Pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in the upper Purús: a complex society in western Amazonia  |first1=Martti |last1=Pärssinen |first2=Denise |last2=Schaan  |first3=Alceu |last3=Ranzi |doi= 10.1017/s0003598x00099373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of pre-Columbian contact across the South Pacific Ocean between South America and [[Polynesia]] has received support from several lines of evidence, although solid confirmation remains elusive. A diffusion by human agents has been put forward to explain the pre-Columbian presence in [[Oceania]] of several [[plant cultivation|cultivated plant]] species native to South America, such as the [[bottle gourd]] (''Lagenaria siceraria'') or [[sweet potato]] (''Ipomoea batatas''). Direct archaeological evidence for such pre-Columbian contacts and transport have not emerged. Similarities noted in names of edible roots in Maori and Ecuadorian languages ("kumari") and Melanesian and Chilean ("gaddu") have been inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Polynesian Society#Publications|Journal of the Polynesian Society]] |year=1923 |volume=32 |issue=128 |first=F.

A 2007 paper published in ''[[PNAS]]'' put forward [[DNA]] and archaeological evidence that domesticated [[chicken]]s had been introduced into South America via Polynesia by late pre-Columbian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Storey |first1=Alice A. |first2=José Miguel |last2=Ramírez |first3=Daniel |last3=Quiroz |first4=David V. |last4=Burley |first5=David J. |last5=Addison |first6=Richard |last6=Walter |first7=Atholl J. |last7=Anderson |first8=Terry L. |last8=Hunt |first9=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; The origin and dating remains an open issue.  Whether or not early Polynesian–American exchanges occurred, no compelling human-genetic, archaeological, cultural or linguistic legacy of such contact has turned up.

====Norte Chico or Caral====
{{Main article|Norte Chico civilization}}
[[File:Caral-Supe in Peru.jpg|thumb|The ancient city of [[Caral]]]]
On the north-central coast of present-day [[Peru]], Norte Chico or Caral (as known in Peru) was a civilization that emerged around 3000 BCE (contemporary with urbanism's rise in [[Mesopotamia]].) It is considered one of the six [[cradles of civilization]] in the world.&lt;ref name=1491Book/&gt; It had a cluster of large-scale urban settlements of which the [[Sacred City of Caral]], in the Supe valley, is one of the largest and best studied sites. Norte Chico or Caral is the oldest known [[civilization]] in the [[Americas]] and persisted until around 1800 BCE.{{citation needed|date= January 2016}}

====Valdivia====
{{Main article|Valdivia culture}}
The [[Valdivia culture]] was concentrated on the coast of [[Ecuador]]. Their existence was recently discovered by archeological findings. Their culture is among the oldest found in the Americas, spanning from 3500 to 1800 BCE. The Valdivia lived in a community of houses built in a circle or oval around a central plaza.  They were sedentary people who lived off farming and fishing, though occasionally they hunted for deer. From the remains that have been found, scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated [[maize]], [[kidney bean]]s, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[cassava]], hot peppers, and [[cotton]] plants, the last of which was used to make clothing. Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical, but it became showy, delicate, and big over time. They generally used red and gray colors; and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period. In its ceramics and stone works, the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works.

====Cañaris====
{{Main article|Cañari}}
The Cañari were the indigenous natives of today's Ecuadorian provinces of [[Cañar Province|Cañar]] and [[Azuay Province|Azuay]]. They were an elaborate civilization with advanced architecture and complex religious beliefs.  The Inca destroyed and burned most of their remains.  The Cañari's old city was replaced twice, first by the Incan city of [[Tumebamba]] and later on the same site by the colonial city of [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]. The city was also believed to be the site of [[El Dorado]], the city of gold from the mythology of Colombia. (see Cuenca)

The Cañari were most notable for having repelled the Incan invasion with fierce resistance for many years until they fell to [[Tupac Yupanqui]]. Many of their descendants are still present in Cañar.  The majority did not mix with the colonists or become Mestizos.
[[File:Museolarco.jpg|thumb|[[Larco Museum]] houses the largest private collection of pre-Columbian art. [[Lima]], [[Peru]].]]

====Chavín====
{{Main article|Chavín culture}}
The Chavín, a South American preliterate civilization, established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BCE, according to some estimates and archeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. The Chavín civilization spanned from 900 to 300 BCE.

==== Muisca ====
{{Main article|Muisca people}}
The [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]-speaking communities were the most numerous, the most territorially extended and the most socio-economically developed of the pre-Hispanic Colombians. By the 8th century, the indigenous people had established their civilization in the northern [[Andes]]. At one point, the Chibchas occupied part of what is now [[Panama]], and the high plains of the Eastern Sierra of [[Colombia]].

The areas which they occupied in Colombia were the present-day Departments of Santander (North and South), Boyacá and Cundinamarca.  This is where the first farms and industries were developed.  It is also where the independence movement originated. They are currently the richest areas in Colombia. The Chibcha developed the most populous zone between the Mayan and Inca empires. Next to the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] of Peru and the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] in Bolivia, the Chibcha of the eastern and north-eastern Highlands of Colombia developed the most notable culture among the [[sedentism|sedentary]] indigenous peoples in South America.

In the Colombian Andes, the Chibcha comprised several tribes who spoke similar languages ([[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]). They included the following: the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Guane people|Guane]], [[Lache people|Lache]], [[Cofán]], and [[Chitarero people|Chitareros]].

====Moche====
{{Main article|Moche culture}}
The Moche thrived on the north coast of Peru from about 100 to 800 CE.  The heritage of the Moche is seen in their elaborate burials.  Some were recently excavated by [[UCLA]]'s [[Christopher B. Donnan]] in association with the [[National Geographic Society]].

As skilled artisans, the Moche were a technologically advanced people.  They traded with distant peoples such as the Maya.  What has been learned about the Moche is based on study of their ceramic pottery; the carvings reveal details of their daily lives. The [[Larco Museum]] of [[Lima]], [[Peru]] has an extensive collection of such ceramics.  They show that the people practiced [[human sacrifice]], had blood-drinking rituals, and that their religion incorporated non-procreative sexual practices (such as [[fellatio]]).

====Tiwanaku empire====
{{main|Tiwanaku empire}}
[[File:Zonnepoort tiwanaku.jpg|thumb|right|Gate of the Sun in Tiwanaku]]
The Tiwanaku empire was based in western [[Bolivia]] and extended into present-day [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] from 300 to 1000. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important South American civilizations prior to the [[Inca Empire]]; it was the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power for approximately five hundred years. The ruins of the ancient city state are near the south-eastern shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] in [[Tiwanaku Municipality]], [[Ingavi Province]], [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz Department]], about {{convert|72|km|miles}} west of [[La Paz, Bolivia|La Paz]].

====Inca Empire====
{{Main article|Inca Empire}}
Holding their capital at the great [[cougar]]-shaped city of [[Cuzco]], the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.  Known as  ''Tawantinsuyu'', or "the land of the four regions", in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed.  Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 40,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise  stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful [[brain surgery]] in Inca civilization.
{{wide image|95 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009.jpg|600px|The iconic [[Machu Picchu]], symbol of the Inca civilization.|center}}

====Cambeba====
{{Main article|Cambeba people}}
Also known as the Omagua, Umana and Kambeba, the Cambeba are an [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous people]] in Brazil's [[Amazon basin]]. The Cambeba were a populous, organized society in the late Pre-Columbian era whose population suffered steep decline in the early years of the [[Columbian Exchange]]. The Spanish explorer [[Francisco de Orellana]] traversed the [[Amazon River]] during the 16th century and reported densely populated regions running hundreds of kilometers along the river. These populations left no lasting monuments, possibly because they used local wood as their construction material as stone was not locally available. While it is possible Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development among the Amazonians, their semi-nomadic descendants have the odd distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary, yet landless, [[aristocracy]]. Archaeological evidence has revealed the continued presence of semi-domesticated orchards, as well as vast areas of land enriched with [[terra preta]]. Both of these discoveries, along with Cambeba ceramics discovered within the same archaeological levels suggest that a large and organized civilization existed in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090302302.html |title=Scientists find evidence discrediting theory Amazon was virtually unlivable |first=Juan |last=Forero |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural development==
{{see|Agriculture on the prehistoric Great Plains|Incan agriculture|Hoe-cultivation belt}}
{{See also|Columbian Exchange|List of pre-Columbian engineering projects in the Americas}}
Early inhabitants of the Americas developed agriculture, developing and breeding [[maize]] (corn) from ears 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm in length to the current size are familiar today. [[Potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[tomatillo]]s (a husked green tomato), [[pumpkin]]s, [[chili pepper]]s, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[bean]]s, [[pineapple]], [[sweet potato]]es, the [[Cereal|grains]] [[quinoa]] and [[amaranth]], [[cocoa bean]]s, [[vanilla]], [[onion]], [[peanut]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[Blueberry|blueberries]], [[Blackberry|blackberries]], [[papaya]], and [[avocado]]s were among other plants grown by natives. Over two-thirds of all types of food crops grown worldwide are native to the Americas.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The natives began using fire in a widespread manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories, thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants that were important for both food and medicines.  This created the [[Pre-Columbian savannas of North America]].&lt;ref name="Owen2002"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/sustain/report/terra2/terra2.htm |title=Chapter 2 (TERRA–2): The History of Native Plant Communities in the South |last=Owen |first=Wayne |work=Southern Forest Resource Assessment Final Report |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[United States Forest Service]], Southern Research Station |date=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not as widespread as in other areas of the world (Asia, Africa, Europe), indigenous Americans did have [[livestock]]. [[Domesticated turkey]]s were common in Mesoamerica and in some regions of North America; they were valued for their meat, feathers, and, possibly, eggs. There is documentation of Mesoamericans utilizing hairless dogs, especially the [[Xoloitzcuintle]] breed, for their meat. Andean societies had [[llama]]s and [[alpaca]]s for meat and wool, as well as for [[Working animal|beasts of burden]]. [[Guinea pig]]s were raised for meat in the [[Andes]]. [[Iguana]]s and a range of wild animals, such as deer and [[pecari]], were another source of meat in Mexico, Central, and northern South America.

By the 15th century, maize had been transmitted from [[Mexico]] and was being farmed in the [[Mississippi embayment]], as far as the [[East Coast of the United States]], and as far north as southern Canada. Potatoes were utilized by the Inca, and [[chocolate]] was used by the Aztecs.

The initial peopling of Berinigia (depicted in light yellow) was followed by a standstill after which the ancestors of indigenous Americans spread swiftly all over the New World while some of the Beringian maternal lineages–C1a-spread westwards. More recent (shown in green) genetic exchange is manifested by back-migration of A2a into Siberia and the spread of D2a into north-eastern America that post-dated the initial peopling of the New World.]]

These SNPs mark the branch of a haplogroup, and indicate that all descendents of that haplogroup at one time shared a common ancestor. The Y-DNA SNP mutations were passed from father to son over thousands of years. Over time, additional SNPs occur within a haplogroup, leading to new lineages.  These new lineages are considered subclades of the haplogroup.  Each time a new mutation occurs, there is a new branch in the haplogroup, and therefore a new subclade. Haplogroup Q, possibly the youngest of the 20 Y-chromosome haplogroups, originated with the SNP mutation M242 in a man from Haplogroup P that likely lived in Siberia approximately 15,000 to 20,000 years before present}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the determinant factor for the number of [[gene]] lineages and founding [[haplotype]]s present in today's Indigenous Amerindian [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|populations]].&lt;ref name=Genebase/&gt;

'''The Regional Oral History Office''' (ROHO) is part of The [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The office was founded in 1954. ROHO conducts, analyzes, teaches about, and preserves [[oral history]] interviews on a wide range of topics related to the history of California and the United States. ROHO staff also conduct research on a wide range of historical topics, utilizing oral history as a central primary source to their scholarship.

ROHO's original name was the Regional Cultural History Office. It was the second oral history office founded in the country, following only Columbia University. The first interview conducted at the office, before it was officially recognized as a unit on campus, was with [[Alice B. Toklas]], the long-time partner of [[Gertrude Stein]].

Since its founding in 1954, ROHO has conducted thousands of interviews in a wide variety of subject areas ranging from law and jurisprudence to food and wine. ROHO features especially strong collections on the development of the arts and letters, science and technology, and labor, social, political, and community history in California. ROHO has also conducted numerous interviews on the history of the University of California. ROHO's interviews with scientists include [[Nobel Prize]] winners such as [[Arthur Kornberg]], [[Paul Berg]], [[Donald A. Glaser]], and [[Charles Townes]]. Other notable interviews with scientists include [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley N. Cohen]]. ROHO has also conducted significant oral histories with well-known artists and authors, such as [[Dorothea Lange]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[Carl Rakosi]].

ROHO houses collections of oral histories related to [[women's suffrage]] and the [[home front]] during World War II.

The interviews conducted by ROHO are deposited in over 700 manuscript libraries worldwide. Many of the interviews are accessible online. The [[Bancroft Library]] also houses the original tapes for all of the interviews conducted by ROHO. Once completed, the oral histories are referenced by both scholars and students around the world.

ROHO's first director was Corinne Gilb, who led the program from 1954 to 1958.  Between 1958 and 2000, [[Willa Baum]] directed ROHO. Under her tenure, ROHO amassed over 1,600 oral histories on a wide variety of subjects. Richard Cándida Smith, who is also a professor in the Department of History at the University of California, Berkeley, directed the office until spring of 2012. During Cándida Smith's tenure, the number of oral history transcripts made available online expanded dramatically. Neil Henry, formerly Dean of the Department of Journalism  at the University of California, Berkeley, is the current director, serving a two-year appointment that commenced in September 2012.

==Shapell Roster Project==

The Shapell Roster Project is the ongoing research of Jewish Civil War soldiers and their stories.  As part of the Foundation's contribution to the Civil War Sesquicentennial Celebration, the Shapell Manuscript Foundation is preparing a new roster of Jewish Civil War soldiers. The Roster is based on a parallel section in [[Simon Wolf]]'s book, The American Jew as Soldier, Patriot and Citizen, (1895), but uses modern research tools and technology to expand and correct the almost 120-year-old roster.

In addition, the Roster will provide documentation (letters, photographs and official documents) for each soldier discussed in the list. At the completion of the project all information and documents will be available online as well as be available in book form. The Roster is scheduled to be published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sellers|first1=John R.|title=Jewish Participation in the Civil War|url=http://lincolncottage.org/jewish-participation-in-the-civil-war/|publisher=President Lincoln's Cottage|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Shapell Roster|url=http://shapellroster.org/about-the-shapell-roster.html|website=Shapell Roster|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish American Historical Research==
In addition to a general focus on the historic manuscripts of universally recognized world-renowned individuals, the foundation's collection frequently relates to the history of American Jewish life. The collected manuscripts explore such topics as the lives of Jewish soldiers during the American Civil War and other topics which bring light to bear on the role of American Jews on the general society around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Menachem M.

==Exhibitions==

The documents and artifacts in the Foundation's holdings have been on display at various exhibitions internationally.  While the Foundation produces its own exhibitions, it also serves as a resource for other institutions' research efforts and exhibitions. The Foundation has collaborated with various historical institutes by creating and enhancing exhibitions with items on loan, and by contributing original research.

The Foundation regularly exhibits at the [[National Library of Israel]] at the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shapell Manuscript Foundation|url=http://merhav.nli.org.il/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do;jsessionid=FC02B0DEC16943F0F635F9AD1B26FD0D?fn=search&amp;ct=search&amp;initialSearch=true&amp;mode=Basic&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;indx=1&amp;dum=true&amp;srt=rank&amp;vid=NLI&amp;frbg=&amp;vl%28freeText0%29=shapell+manuscript+foundation&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28NNL%29|website=Merhav|publisher=The National Library of Israel|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The administrative offices are located in the United States and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shapell Manuscript Foundation in Beverly Hills, California (CA)|url=http://www.faqs.org/tax-exempt/CA/Benjamin-Shapell-Family-Foundation.html#overview_a|publisher=FAQS.org|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|Sigillography}}[[Image:sealtaglarge.jpg|thumb|right|Pine [[resin]] seal on [[vellum]] tag or tail of an  English [[deed]] ''(1638)''.]]

'''Sigillography''' (sometimes referred to under its Greek name, '''sphragistics''') is one of the [[auxiliary sciences of history]]. It refers to the study of [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] attached to [[document]]s as a source of historical information. It concentrates on the legal and social meaning of seals, as well as the evolution of their design. It has links to [[diplomatics]], [[heraldry]], [[social history]], and the [[Art history|history of art]].

[[Antiquarian|Antiquaries]] began to record historic seals in the 15th century, and in the 16th and 17th centuries their study became a fairly widespread antiquarian activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=P.D.A. |last1=Harvey |first2=Andrew |last2=McGuinness |title=A Guide to British Medieval Seals |location=London |publisher=British Library and Public Record Office |year=1996 |pages=22–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Elizabeth |last=New |title=Seals and Sealing Practices |publisher=British Records Association |series=Archives and the User |volume=11 |year=2010 |location=London |ISBN=978-0-900222-15-3 |pages=29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sigillography is first found in the works of [[Jean Mabillon]] in the late 17th century, and in those of [[Johann Michael Heineccius]] soon afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Initially thought of as a branch of [[diplomatics]], the discipline gradually became an independent branch of historical studies.

In the second half of the 19th century sigillography was further developed by German and French historians, among them [[Hermann Grotefend]], [[Otto Posse]], [[Louis-Claude Douet d'Arcq]] and [[Germain Demay]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Sigillography is also an important subdiscipline of [[Byzantine studies]], involving the study of Byzantine lead seal impressions and the text and images thereon. Its importance derives from both the scarcity of surviving Byzantine documents themselves, and from the large number (over 40,000) of extant seals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first = Alexander| editor-last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=1894–1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest compendiums of Byzantine seals can be found in the large-volume by Gustave Schlumberger, "Sigillographie de l'empire Byzantin", published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first = Gustave| editor-last = Schlumberger | title = [[Sigillographie de l'empire Byzantin]] | publisher = Ernest Leroux | year = 1904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture ==

Sigillography features in the plot of "[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]", one of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10946">'''Temple denial''' refers to the assertion that none of the [[Temples in Jerusalem]] ever existed or were not located on the [[Temple Mount]]. Israeli writer [[David Hazony]] has described the phenomenon as "a campaign of intellectual erasure [by Palestinian leaders, writers, and scholars] ... aimed at undermining the Jewish claim to any part of the land", and compared the phenomenon to [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazony, David. "[http://www.nysun.com/article/49985 Temple Denial In the Holy City]", ''[[The New York Sun]]'', March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold, pp. 10 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Levin (writer)|Daniel Levin]] calls Temple denial a "relatively new phenomenon" that "has become a central tenet of [[Palestinian nationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/116770 Daniel Levin, Denial on the Temple Mount, The Forward, Oct. 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated: "The [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Islamic land trust]] is destroying Judeo-Christian ruins beneath the Temple Mount so as to deny any connection between Judaism and Christianity and Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/story.htm?sid=5&amp;id=253204 |title='EMBERS' OF TRUTH IN NEW THRILLER |work=Chicago Jewish News |date=August 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014134653/http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/story.htm?sid=5&amp;id=253204 |archive-date=October 14, 2013 |access-date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dore Gold]], president of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] and former [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations|Israeli ambassador to the United Nations]], used the term "Temple denial" in his 2007 book, ''The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City''.

The ''New York Times'' noted that "Temple denial, increasingly common among Palestinian leaders, also has a long history: After Israel became a state in 1948, the Waqf removed from its guidebooks all references to King Solomon's Temple, whose location at the site it had previously said was "beyond dispute.""&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/world/middleeast/mistrust-threatens-delicate-balance-at-a-sacred-site-in-jerusalem-.html Mistrust Threatens Delicate Balance at a Sacred Site in Jerusalem, The New York Times, Nov. 22, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Brief Guide to al-Haram al-Sharif'', a booklet published in 1925 (and earlier) by the "Supreme Moslem Council", a body established by the British government to administer [[waqf]]s and headed by Hajj [[Amin al-Husayni]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] period, states on page 4: "The site is one of the oldest in the world. Its sanctity dates from the earliest (perhaps from pre-historic) times. Its identity with the site of Solomon's Temple is beyond dispute. This, too, is the spot, according to universal belief, on which 'David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.'(''2 Samuel 24:25'')"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-is-beneath-the-temple-mount-920764/?device=ipad&amp;no-ist=&amp;page=3 |title=What is Beneath the Temple Mount? |author=Joshua Hammer |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |access-date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gold and [[Dennis Ross]], at the [[2000 Camp David Summit]] [[Yasser Arafat]] insisted that "the Temple"  existed near [[Nablus]], not on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Gold_11&gt;Gold, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Ross and Gidi Grinstein, reply by Hussein Agha and Robert Malley,  [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/14529 "Camp David: An Exchange,"] ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', September 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brit Hume, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,50830,00.html Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722060043/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,50830,00.html |date=2009-07-22 }} with [[Dennis Ross]], ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', [[Fox News]], April 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  And in the recollection of [[Ehud Barak]], referring to a conversation he had with Clinton, Arafat said to the US President, "there is nothing there [i.e., no trace of a temple on the Temple Mount]." &lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/06/13/camp-david-and-after-an-exchange-1-an-interview-wi/ "Camp David and After: An Exchange (1.

Ross later wrote about an August 2000 meeting he had with Arafat: "Since we would be discussing the options on the Haram, I anticipated that Arafat might well again declare that the Temple—the most sacred place in Jewish tradition—did not exist in Jerusalem, but was in Nablus.... I wanted Gamal, a Christian of Coptic origin who was originally from Egypt, to tell Arafat that this was an outrageous attempt to delegitimize the Israeli connection to Jerusalem....  Finally, after nearly ten minutes of increasing invective, I intervened and said 'Mr. Chairman, regardless of what you think, the President of the United States ''knows'' that the Temple existed in Jerusalem. If he hears you denying its existence there, he will never again take you seriously. My advice to you is never again raise this issue in his presence.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the fight for Middle East Peace'' by Dennis Ross (2004, {{isbn|0-374-19973-6}}), p. 718&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gold, in the wake of Arafat's remark at Camp David, Temple denial "spread across the Middle East like wildfire", and even "subtly slipped into the writing of Middle-East based western reporters".&lt;ref name=Gold_12&gt;Gold, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in a book entitled ''From Jerusalem to Mecca and Back; The Islamic Consolidation of Jerusalem'', [[Yitzhak Reiter]] describes the growing tendency of Islamic authorities to deny the existence of the Jewish Temples on the Temple Mount, characterizing it as part of a campaign to increase the status of Jerusalem and the Temple mount in Islam as part of the effort to make Jerusalem a Muslim city under Arab governance. According to Reiter, this narrative "reflects the mainstream in many Islamic communities around the world", and is promoted by "religious figures, politicians, academics and journalists".&lt;ref&gt;"From Jerusalem to Mecca and Back; The Islamic Consolidation of Jerusalem", Yitzhak Reiter, Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the beginning was Al-Aqsa; A new study exposes the systematic Muslim denial of the existence of Solomon's Temple by clergymen, historians and statesmen.

Not all Islamic scholars accept Temple denialism. Imam [[Abdul Hadi Palazzi]], leader of the Italian Muslim Assembly and a co-founder and a co-chairman of the Islam-Israel Fellowship, quotes the [[Quran]] to support Judaism's special connection to the Temple Mount. According to Palazzi, "[t]he most authoritative Islamic sources affirm the Temples". He adds that Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims because of its prior holiness to Jews and its standing as home to the biblical prophets and kings David and Solomon, all of whom he says are sacred figures also in Islam. He claims that the Quran "expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims".&lt;ref name="margolis"&gt;

==Journalistic response==
In October 2015, the ''[[New York Times]]'' published an article stating that "The question, which many books and scholarly treatises have never definitely answered, is whether the 37-acre site, home to Islam's sacred Dome of the Rock shrine and al-Aqsa Mosque, was also the precise location of two ancient Jewish temples, one built on the remains of the other, and both long since gone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Historical Certainty Proves Elusive at Jerusalem’s Holiest Place (original version) | newspaper=The New York Times | date=8 October 2015 | author=Gladstone, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few days, the newspaper responded to feedback by changing the text to "The question, which many books and scholarly treatises have never definitively answered, is where on the 37-acre site, home to Islam’s sacred Dome of the Rock shrine and Al Aqsa Mosque, was the precise location of two ancient Jewish temples, one built on the remains of the other, and both long since gone."&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/world/middleeast/historical-certainty-proves-elusive-at-jerusalems-holiest-place.html | title=Historical Certainty Proves Elusive at Jerusalem’s Holiest Place | publisher=The New York Times | work=Newspaper | date=8 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015 | author=Gladstone, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ngo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/temple-at-jerusalem/contested-temple-mount-history/ | title=Contested Temple Mount History? | publisher=Bible History Daily | work=Website | date=13 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015 | author=Ngo, Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, the newspaper further corrected the story, backdating the Islamic [[waqf]] that controls the site from 1967 to 1187.&lt;ref name=NYT2/&gt;

{{About|the 1931 Baptist history text by James Milton Carroll|the 1976 historical novel|Kenneth Bulmer}}
{{italic title}}
[[File:The Trail of Blood.jpg|thumb|400px|]]
'''''The Trail of Blood''''' (1931) is a book by American [[Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] [[James Milton Carroll]]. It is a collection of five lectures he gave on the history of [[Baptist]] churches, which he presented as a succession from the first Christians.  

The full title is ''The Trail of Blood -: Following the Christians Down through the Centuries - or, The History of Baptist Churches from the Time of [[Christ]], Their Founder, to the Present Day''.&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;William Hull, "William Heth Whitsitt: Martyrdom of a Moderate," ''Distinctively Baptist: Essays on Baptist History'', ed. Marc A. Jolley, John D. Pierce, pp. 237-78, p. 255, note 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll presents modern Baptists as the direct succession of a strain of Christianity dating to [[Apostolic Age|apostolic]] times, which was a [[Landmarkism|Landmarkist]] view first promoted in the mid-nineteenth century by [[James Robinson Graves]].  He started an influential movement in Tennessee and the western states. The Landmark controversy divided many Baptists, and ultimately led to the formation of the [[American Baptist Association]] in 1924, as well as Gospel Missions and unaffiliated churches. 

Carroll claims a descent by modern Baptists from such earlier groups as the [[Waldensians]], the [[Cathari]], the [[Paulicians]], and the [[Donatists]].  Carroll acknowledges a number of other writers, including G.H. Orchard and [[John T. Christian]]. The title is taken from [[James Robinson Graves]]' ''[[The Trilemma]]''.&lt;ref name=Hull/&gt; The book was published in the year Carroll died. Today the copyright to Carroll's book is held by Ashland Avenue Baptist Church in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

==Controversy==

James Edward McGoldrick wrote a response to Carroll's work called ''Baptist Successionism'' which gave researched opposition to the theory of "[[Baptist Successionism]]."

'''Totalitarian democracy''' is a term popularized by Israeli historian [[J. L. Talmon]] to refer to a system of [[government]] in which lawfully elected [[Legislator|representatives]] maintain the integrity of a [[nation state]] whose [[citizen]]s, while granted the right to [[vote]], have little or no [[participation (decision making)|participation]] in the decision-making process of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Talmon, J. L. ''The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy.'' Britain: Secker &amp; Warburg, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase had previously been used by [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]]&lt;ref&gt;de Juvenel, Bertrand. ''On Power: Its Nature and the History of its Growth,'' Salt Lake City: Hutchinson, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E. H. Carr]],&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward Hallett. ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World''. New York: MacMillan Company, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently by [[F. William Engdahl]]&lt;ref&gt;Engdahl, F. William. ''Full Spectrum Dominance: Totalitarian Democracy in the New World Order.'' Boxboro, MA: Third Millennium Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-9795608-6-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sheldon S. Wolin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolin, Sheldon S. ''Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==J. L. Talmon&lt;!--'Messianic democracy' and 'Political Messianism' redirect here--&gt;==

[[J. L. Talmon]]'s 1952 book ''The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy'' discusses the transformation of a state in which [[tradition]]al values and articles of [[faith]] shape the role of government into one in which social utility takes absolute precedence. His work is a criticism of the ideas of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], whose political philosophy greatly influenced the [[French Revolution]], the growth of the Enlightenment across Europe, as well the overall development of modern political and educational thought. In ''[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|The Social Contract]]'', Rousseau contends that the interests of the individual and the state are one and the same, and it is the state's responsibility to implement the "[[general will]]".

The [[political neologism]] '''messianic democracy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also '''political Messianism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Talmon, ''Political Messianism – The Romantic Phase'', 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; also derives from Talmon's introduction to this work:
:Indeed, from the vantage point of the mid twentieth century the history of the last hundred and fifty years looks like a systematic preparation for the headlong collision between empirical and liberal democracy on the one hand, and totalitarian Messianic democracy on the other, in which the world crisis of to-day consists. — [http://rousseaustudies.free.fr/ReeditionTalmon.htm rousseaustudies.free.fr]

== Differences in democratic philosophy ==

The [[philosophy]] of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[democracy]], according to Talmon, is based on a top-down view of society, which sees an absolute and perfect political truth to which all reasonable humans are driven. It is contended that not only is it beyond the individual to arrive at this truth independently, it is his duty and responsibility to aid his compatriots in realizing it. Moreover, any public or private activities that do not forward this goal have no useful purpose, sap time and energy from those that do, and must be eliminated. Thus economic and social endeavors, which tend to strengthen the collective, are seen as valuable, whereas [[education]] and [[religion]], which tend to strengthen the individual, are seen as counterproductive. "You cannot be a citizen and a Christian at the same time," says Talmon, referring to Rousseau's arguments, "for the loyalties clash."

In his paper ''Advances in Chinese Social Sciences'' (2001), [[Mao Shoulong]], a professor of [[Public Policy]] at [[Renmin University of China]], takes a different position. He posits that totalitarian democracy, or what he terms "equality-oriented democracy," is founded on the idea that it is possible, and necessary, that the complete [[rights]] and freedoms of people ought not be held hostage to traditions and social arrangements. Mao recognizes that the term "totalitarian" has a connotation attached to it, used as it was by [[Giovanni Gentile]] to apply to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Fascism|fascist]] government led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. He sees the proponents of [[liberal democracy]] (or "Western" democracy) as holding a negative attitude to the word and believing that force is not an appropriate way to achieve a goal no matter the value of that goal. He prefers the term "freedom-oriented democracy" to describe such a political entity.

===Fundamental requirements===

A totalitarian democracy, says Talmon, accepts "exclusive territorial [[sovereignty]]" as its right. It retains full power of [[Nationalization|expropriation]] and full power of imposition, i.e., the right of control over everything and everyone. Maintenance of such power, in the absence of full support of the citizenry, requires the forceful suppression of any [[dissent]]ing element except what the government purposely permits or organizes. [[Liberal democrat]]s, who see political strength as growing from the bottom up (cf: "[[grass roots]]"), reject in principle the idea of [[coercion]] in shaping political will, but the totalitarian democratic state holds it as an ongoing [[Moral imperative|imperative]].

A totalitarian democratic state is said to maximize its control over the lives of its citizens by using the dual rationale of general will (i.e., "public good") and [[majority rule]]. An argument can be made that in some circumstances it is actually the [[politics|political]], [[economics|economic]], and [[military]] [[elite|élite]] who interpret the general will to suit their own interests. Again, however, it is the imperative of achieving the overarching goal of a political [[nirvana]] that shapes the vision of the process, and the citizen is expected to contribute to the best of his abilities; the general is not asked to guide the plow, nor is the farmer asked to lead the troops.

It can approach the condition of totalitarianism; totalitarian states can also approach the condition of democracy, or at least [[majoritarianism]]. Citizens of a totalitarian democratic state, even when aware of their true powerlessness, may support their government. When [[Germany]] started World War II, the [[Nazism|Nazi]] government had the support of the majority of Germans and it was not until much later, after Germany's losses began to mount, that support for [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] began to fade. [[Joseph Stalin]] was practically worshipped by hundreds of millions of Soviet citizens, many of whom have not changed their opinion even today, and his status ensured his economic and political reforms would be carried out.

===Cold War and socio-economic illustrations===

The period of the [[Cold War]] following WWII saw great [[Ideology|ideological]] [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] between the so-called "[[Free World]]" and the [[Communist state]]s.  In the East, religious and intellectual repression was met with increasing resistance, and the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungarian revolt of 1956]] and [[Alexander Dubček]]'s [[Prague Spring]] in 1968 are two well-known acts of defiance where thousands were murdered in cold blood by their governments. The [[Tienanmen Square Massacre]] was a similar example of repressive violence leading to hundreds of deaths. In the United States, alleged Communists and Communist sympathizers were investigated by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in what later generations would recall as a "[[witch hunt]]"; many accused Communists were forced out of their jobs or their reputations were scandalized. Shortly after the time of Talmon's book, the [[Vietnam War]] brought active hostility between elements in the U.S. government and political factions within the American people. One faction insisted that the U.S. government did not represent them in levying war in Southeast Asia, protesting the war, as well as undemocratic or oligarchical power-structures within U.S. society{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}; [[anti-war movement|this faction]] occasionally saw repression from the government, such as through "dirty tricks" aimed at "[[subversives]]" by the [[FBI]] in [[COINTELPRO]]. This conflict within U.S. society rose to violence during the protests and riots at the [[Democratic National Convention of 1968]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and in the [[Kent State Massacre]], where 4 anti-war protesters were shot dead by U.S. [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] forces.

One concept fundamental to both "liberal" and "totalitarian" democracy is that of [[liberty]]. According to Talmon, totalitarian democracy sees freedom as something achieved only in the long term, and only through collective effort; the political goal of ultimate order and ultimate harmony brings ultimate freedom. In addressing every aspect of the lives of its citizens, the totalitarian democratic state has the power to ensure that all material needs are met from cradle to grave, and all that is required of the citizen is to carry out his role, whatever it may be, to the best of his ability. Liberal democracy, on the other hand, posits freedom as something that can and should be achieved by the individual in the short term, even at the expense of things such as material well-being, and sees as an element of this freedom a "freedom from government" wherein the individual is able to exercise "freedom" in his own terms to the extent that they do not contravene the law. Proponents of both kinds of democracy argue that their particular approach is the best one for the citizens of their respective countries.

It is Mao Shoulong's contention that "equality-oriented democracy recognises the value of freedom but holds that [it] can't be attained by individual efforts," but rather, by collective efforts. He argues that while equality-oriented democracy stresses the value of equality over individual freedoms, the reverse is true for freedom-oriented democracy, and in each case, the state will move either to ensure equality by limiting individual freedom, or to ensure individual freedom by giving up equality. Some critics of this view may argue that equality and individual freedoms are inseparable, and that one cannot exist (or be sustained) without the other. Other critics argue that equality can only be ensured by continuous coercion, while ensuring individual freedom only requires force against coercive individuals and external states.

Shoulong also holds that a law is not valid if it does not have the approval of the public. Laws passed by the state do not require approval by the citizen on a case-by-case basis, and it can be easily argued that some laws currently in place in some countries purporting to be liberal democracies do not have the approval of the majority of citizens. For one, Rousseau argued in "The Social Contract", that in the stereotypical liberal democracy, individuals are politically "free" once every Parliamentary term, or every two to four years, when they vote for their representatives, in their General Election or on Election Day. Yet, Rousseau fails to consider that the state is not a [[total institution]] within the liberal democracies, and that the freedom of the citizen in between the elections is the freedom of the citizen to live their life in pursuit of their own happiness, subject to the law made by their elected representatives, who are, in turn, subject to popular pressure, [[protest|public protest]], [[right of petition|petition]], [[recall election|recall]], [[referendum]], [[initiative]], and ultimately, electoral defeat if they fail to heed the views of those they represent. This is in contrast to a totalitarian democracy, with the state as a total institution, where the individual is truly not free without constant participation in their "democratic" government; and thus, the individual in the totalitarian democracy must be "forced to be free" if the totalitarian democracy is not to become a totalitarian [[oligarchy]].

== F. William Engdahl and Sheldon S. Wolin ==
Engdahl and Wolin add some new dimensions to the analysis of totalitarianism. In ''Full Spectrum Dominance: Totalitarian Democracy and the New World Order,'' Engdahl focuses on the American drive to achieve global hegemony through military and economic means. According to him, U.S state objectives have led to internal conditions that resemble totalitarianism: "[it is] a power establishment that over the course of the [[Cold War]] has spun out of control and now threatens not only the fundamental institutions of democracy, but even of life on the planet through the growing risk of nuclear war by miscalculation"&lt;ref&gt;Engdahl, ''Full Spectrum Dominance,'' pg. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolin, too, analyzes the symbiosis of business and public interests that emerged in the Cold War to form the ''tendency'' of what he calls "[[inverted totalitarianism]]:"

&lt;blockquote&gt;While exploiting the authority and resources of the state, [inverted totalitarianism] gains its dynamic by combining with other forms of power, such as evangelical religions, and most notably by encouraging a symbiotic relationship between traditional government and the system of "private" governance represented by the modern business corporation. The result is not a system of codetermination by equal partners who retain their respective identities but rather a system that represents the political coming-of-age of [[corporate power]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolin, ''Democracy Incorporated,'' pg. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, in an article entitled "Inverted Totalitarianism"&lt;ref&gt;Wolin, Sheldon S. [http://www.thenation.com/article/inverted-totalitarianism "Inverted Totalitarianism"]. ''The Nation'' magazine, May 19th, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolin cites phenomena such as the lack of involvement of citizens in a narrow political framework (due to the influence of money), the privatization of social security, and massive increases in military spending and spending on surveillance as examples of the push away from public and towards private-controlled government. Corporate influence is explicit through the media, and implicit through the privatization of the university. Furthermore, many political think-tanks have abetted this process by spreading conservative ideology. Wolin states: "[With] the elements all in place...what is at stake, then, is nothing less than the attempted transformation of a tolerably free society into a variant of the extreme regimes of the past century"&lt;ref&gt;Wolin, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Žižek]] comes to similar conclusions in his book ''[[Welcome to the Desert of the Real]].''&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, Slavoj. ''Welcome to the Desert of the Real'', London and New York: Verso, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Here he argues that the [[war on terror]] served as a justification for the suspension of civil liberties in the USA, while the promise of democracy and freedom was spread abroad as the justification for invading [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Since Western democracies are always justifying [[state of exception|states of exception]], they are failing as sites of political agency.

'''Transhistoricity''' is the quality of holding throughout human history, not merely within the frame of reference of a particular form of [[society]] at a particular stage of historical development. An entity or concept that has transhistoricity is said to be '''transhistorical'''.

Certain theories of history (e.g. that of [[Historicism#Hegelian|Hegel]]), treat human history as divided into distinct [[historical period|epoch]]s with their own internal [[logic]]s—[[historical materialism]] is the most famous case of such a theory. States of affairs which hold within one epoch may be completely absent, or carry opposite implications in another, according to these theories.

== In the abstract ==
Transhistoricity may be seen as the necessary [[antithesis]] to the idea that meanings are bounded by their historical context. It is the temporal equivalent of the spatial concept of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]].

== In sociopolitical theory ==
Questions of what might and might not be transhistorical phenomena are typically the concern of historians and sociologists identifying with the [[Historicism|historicist]] traditions of [[Hegel]]ian or [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] thought, but matter additionally in the debates around [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of [[paradigm shift]] and similar discussions. 

[[Fredric Jameson]], a [[Marxist]] or perhaps [[post-modern]] theorist, is a case in point. He famously asserted that theory must "Always historicize!", going on to wryly observe that this order was itself a "transhistorical imperative".&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric (1981). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9xE6vLE71yUC&amp;dq=%22the+political+unconscious%22+books&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=book-ref-page-link&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail&amp;hl=en ''The Political Unconscious'']. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others look for transhistorical continuities to inform what's basic to the human condition. For example, D. K. Simonton, finds some regularities in the types of ideas that gain ascendancy following certain types of historical events, in a data series spanning 2,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, D. K. (1976). ''The Sociopolitical Context of Philosophical Beliefs: A Transhistorical Causal Analysis''. ''Social Forces''. vol. 54. pp. 513–523.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, research in the vicinity of [[Evolutionary psychology]] has proceeded on the basis that some observed transcultural regularities in human behaviour are also transhistoric, accounted for by their being fixed in the genetic legacy common to all ''Homo sapiens''.

== In aesthetics ==
Part of the debate over the distinction between [[high art]] and [[folk art]] (or lesser disciplines) hinges on the question of whether art can (and if so, if it should) aspire to transcend the particular frame of reference within which it was produced. This frame may be taken to be historically delimited.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Paul (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XpMsL8f56RMC&amp;dq=transhistorical+image+philosophizing+art ''The Transhistoric Image: Philosophizing Art and Its History'']. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">'''Transnational history''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at how developments within the history of one [[country]] have been shaped by developments outside of this country, e.g. how [[History of the British Isles|British history]] has been shaped by developments coming from [[France]], [[Germany]] or [[the US]]. The idea of transnationalism can be traced back to 1991, when [[Ian Tyrrell]] pioneered this approach but it was in the field of [[American Studies]], in the late 1990s, that the concept really was developed. Since then the term has been adopted by the field of history. 

As the concept is still relatively new with the field of history, a consensus has not emerged on how to define the term precisely. However, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[historian]] Nils Arne Sørensen emphasizes that an important feature of transnational history is to reject the [[nation state]] as the "natural" frame for historical analysis. This redirection of historical studies can be seen as countermove to the fact that the field of history was founded in the 19th century while the [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement was on the rise in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Arne Sørensen (2009) "[https://tidsskrift.dk/historisktidsskrift/article/view/56424/76630 Den transnationale vending?]"i ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Denmark)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' Volume 109, Issue 2: 459-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier define transnational history as having to do with the "connections and circulations" between societies in the [[modern age]].&lt;ref&gt;Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier (2009) ''Palgrave Dictionary of Transnational History''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Tyrrell argues that transnational history is related to the [[Annales school]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell (2008) [https://iantyrrell.wordpress.com/what-is-transnational-history/ "What is transnational history?"] ''Ian Tyrell'' (blog)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7489">The '''Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle Ingolstadt e. V.''' (''Ingolstadt Research Institute for Contemporary Historical Research [[Eingetragener Verein|registered association]]'', ''ZFI'', also known as ''Institut für Zeitgeschichtsforschung Ingolstadt'') is a [[Historical revisionism|historical revisionist]] association located in [[Dunsdorf]], [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Anton Maegerle, Daniel Hörsch: ''„Der Kampf um die Köpfe“ hat begonnen. Vordenker, Strategen und Wegbereiter rechter Netzwerke''. In: Stephan Braun, Daniel Hörsch (Hrsg.): ''Rechte Netzwerke, eine Gefahr''. VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2004, {{ISBN|3-8100-4153-X}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political orientation==

The ZFI was founded in 1981 and shaped by [[Alfred Schickel]], [[Hellmut Diwald]] and {{illm|Alfred Seidl|de|Alfred Seidl}}, in opposition to the renowned [[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]] (Institut für Contemporary History) in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="redok 06-12-14"&gt;[http://www.redok.de/content/view/493/36/ ''Geschichtsrevisionistischer Verein'']. redok, 14 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It has about 500 to 600 members. It organizes large meetings twice a year, and publishes the ''Zeitgeschichtliche Bibliothek'' and the ''ZFI-Informationen''.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Angerstorfer, Annemarie Dengg: ''Rechte Strukturen in Bayern. Eine Dokumentation mit Schwerpunkt Oberbayern, Oberpfalz und Niederbayern.'' Second revised edition, Munich 2005, p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen E. Atkins has stated that the ZFI is a Holocaust denial institution in Germany, while the head of the ZFI, Alfred Schickel, is careful to avoid German restrictions against disputing the Holocaust and has concentrated on what Atkins describes as “so-called [[Allied war crimes during World War II|Allied atrocities]] against the Germans”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Stephen E.|last=Atkins|authorlink=Stephen E. Atkins|title=Holocaust denial as an international movement|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|page=105|ISBN=978-0-313-34538-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Schickel wrote in 1980 that the number of six millions Jews killed in the [[Holocaust]] was “no longer advocated seriously today in contemporary historical science”.&lt;ref&gt;“heute in der zeitgeschichtlichen Wissenschaft nicht mehr ernsthaft vertreten”, Alfred Schickel in ''Deutschland in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 1980, cited from: Geschichtsrevisionistischer Verein, ''redok'', 14 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "The ZFI rejects the findings of historical research, and uses ideologically based [[pseudohistory]]. In doing so, it creates a "parallel universe" isolated from scholarly discourse by self-referencing to its own publications."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Benz  |first1=Wolfgang  |authorlink1=Wolfgang Benz |last2=Reif-Spirek |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Reif-Spirek|title=Geschichtsmythen|publisher=Metropol|year=2003|ISBN=978-3-936411-28-7|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conferences and meetings, [[Nazism|National Socialism]] is trivialized, and the German guilt for the [[Second World War]] is denied. This happens in close collaboration with periodicals such as ''[[Europa Vorn]]'', ''[[Nation und Europa]]'' and ''{{illm|Deutschland in Geschichte und Gegenwart|de|Grabert_Verlag#Geschichte}}'', which pursue similar goals.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bernd|author=Wagner|title=Handbuch Rechtsextremismus. Netzwerke, Parteien, Organisationen, Ideologiezentren, Medien|location=Reinbek bei Hamburg|year=1994|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of ZFI, who except for Schickel have died, have collaborated with historical revisionist and [[Radical right (Europe)|Radical right]] organizations.&lt;ref name="redok 06-12-14"/&gt; Former [[GDR]] policeman {{illm|Bernd Wagner|de|Bernd Wagner (Kriminalist)}} regarded the ZFI in 1994 as "one of the intellectual centers of [[Far right in Germany|far right]] [[historical revisionism]] in Germany".&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt;

==Criticism==

The ZFI was previously observed by the intelligence service of the Bavarian government. However, the ZFI no longer features in the yearly reports of the intelligence service, that depict extremist and anti-constitutional activities. In February 2007, the service stated, though, that "Publications belonging to the far right refer to the Head of the ZFI and his articles in order to propagate thoughts which are not compatible with the free democratic order." &lt;ref&gt;„Dagegen propagieren einschlägige rechtsextremistische Publikationen unter Berufung auf die Person des Leiters der ZFI und seine Artikel vereinzelt auch ein mit der freiheitlichen demokratischen Grundordnung nicht vereinbares Gedankengut.“, ''Bayerischer Landtag'', [http://www.bayern.landtag.de/ElanTextAblage_WP15/Drucksachen/Schriftliche%20Anfragen/15_0007335.pdf Drucksache 15/7335], 22 February 2007, Answer to a written inquiry by the deputy Florian Ritter, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and others have made allegations that {{illm|Alfred Lehmann|de|Alfred_Lehmann_(Politiker,_1950)}} ([[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]), Lord Mayor of Ingolstadt, has participated several times in  ZFI conferences, while [[Horst Seehofer]] (CSU), the minister for food, agriculture and consumer protection, had sent a laudatory greeting to the organization.&lt;ref name="redok 06-12-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SPD-Pressestelle: [http://www.spd-landtag.de/aktuell/presse_anzeigen.cfm?mehr=7135 ''SPD-Rechtspolitiker Florian Ritter sieht Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle Ingolstadt (ZFI) im Zwielicht''], 22 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more active critics of the institution include the left-wing journalist [[Anton Maegerle]], who published his portrait of the ZFI in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnr.de/content/kaempfer-fuer-eine-neue-zeitgeschichte Kämpfer für eine neue Zeitgeschichte] in Blick nach Rechts 29.05.1996&lt;/ref&gt; Its publications are widely considered to be of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Wippermann]]:''Verdiente Revisionisten. Alfred Schickel und die "Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle Ingolstadt (ZFI)"''. In: Johannes Klotz, Ulrich Schneider (eds.): ''Die selbstbewußte Nation und ihr Geschichtsbild.'' Köln 1997, {{ISBN|3-89438-137-X}}, pp. 78-95.&lt;/ref&gt;
